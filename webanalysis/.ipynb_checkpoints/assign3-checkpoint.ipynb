      "IntroductionBackgroundFollowing World War I, France acquired a mandate over the northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The French demarcated the region of Lebanon in 1920 and granted this area independence in 1943. Since independence, the country has been marked by periods of political turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on its position as a regional center for finance and trade. The country\\'s 1975-90 civil war, which resulted in an estimated 120,000 fatalities, was followed by years of social and political instability. Sectarianism is a key element of Lebanese political life. Neighboring Syria has historically influenced Lebanon\\'s foreign policy and internal policies, and its military occupied Lebanon from 1976 until 2005. The Lebanon-based Hizballah militia and Israel continued attacks and counterattacks against each other after Syria\\'s withdrawal, and fought a brief war in 2006. Lebanon\\'s borders with Syria and Israel remain unresolved.TipVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.Definitions and NotesArrow Right IconGeographyLocationMiddle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Israel and SyriaGeographic coordinates33 50 N, 35 50 EMap referencesMiddle EastAreatotal: 10,400 sq kmland: 10,230 sq kmwater: 170 sq kmcountry comparison to the world: 168Area - comparativeabout one-third the size of Marylandabout one-third the size of Maryland\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/>Area comparison mapEnlargeLand boundariestotal: 484 kmborder countries (2): Israel 81 km, Syria 403 kmCoastline225 kmMaritime claimsterritorial sea: 12 nmClimateMediterranean; mild to cool, wet winters with hot, dry summers; the Lebanon Mountains experience heavy winter snowsTerrainnarrow coastal plain; El Beqaa (Bekaa Valley) separates Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon MountainsElevationhighest point: Qornet es Saouda 3,088 mlowest point: Mediterranean Sea 0 mmean elevation: 1,250 mNatural resourceslimestone, iron ore, salt, water-surplus state in a water-deficit region, arable landLand useagricultural land: 63.3% (2018 est.)arable land: 11.9% (2018 est.)permanent crops: 12.3% (2018 est.)permanent pasture: 39.1% (2018 est.)forest: 13.4% (2018 est.)other: 23.3% (2018 est.)Irrigated land1,040 sq km (2012)Total renewable water resources4.503 billion cubic meters (2017 est.)Population distributionthe majority of the people live on or near the Mediterranean coast, and of these most live in and around the capital, Beirut; favorable growing conditions in the Bekaa Valley, on the southeastern side of the Lebanon Mountains, have attracted farmers and thus the area exhibits a smaller population densityNatural hazardsearthquakes; dust storms, sandstormsEnvironment - international agreementsparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Climate Change-Paris Agreement, Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Nuclear Test Ban, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlandssigned, but not ratified: Environmental Modification, Marine Life ConservationGeography - notesmallest country in continental Asia; Nahr el Litani is the only major river in Near East not crossing an international boundary; rugged terrain historically helped isolate, protect, and develop numerous factional groups based on religion, clan, and ethnicityPeople and SocietyPopulation5,261,372 (July 2021 est.)country comparison to the world: 121Nationalitynoun: Lebanese (singular and plural)adjective: LebaneseEthnic groupsArab 95%, Armenian 4%, other 1%note: many Christian Lebanese do not identify themselves as Arab but rather as descendants of the ancient Canaanites and prefer to be called PhoeniciansLanguagesArabic (official), French, English, Armenianmajor-language sample(s): (Arabic)The World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.Arabic audio sample:ReligionsMuslim 61.1% (30.6% Sunni, 30.5% Shia, smaller percentages of Alawites and Ismailis), Christian 33.7% (Maronite Catholics are the largest Christian group), Druze 5.2%, very small numbers of Jews, Baha\\'is, Buddhists, and Hindus (2018 est.)note: data represent the religious affiliation of the citizen population (data do not include Lebanon\\'s sizable Syrian and Palestinian refugee populations); 18 religious sects recognizedMENA religious affiliationfile-iconAge structure0-14 years: 20.75% (male 581,015/female 554,175)15-24 years: 14.98% (male 417,739/female 401,357)25-54 years: 46.69% (male 1,296,250/female 1,257,273)55-64 years: 9.62% (male 250,653/female 275,670)65 years and over: 7.96% (male 187,001/female 248,479) (2020 est.)For additional information, please see the entry for Population pyramid on the Definitions and Notes page.\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/>population pyramidEnlargeDependency ra\n"
