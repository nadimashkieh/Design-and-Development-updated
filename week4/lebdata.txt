IntroductionBackgroundFollowing World War I, France acquired a mandate over the northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The French demarcated the region of Lebanon in 1920 and granted this area independence in 1943. Since independence, the country has been marked by periods of political turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on its position as a regional center for finance and trade. The country\'s 1975-90 civil war, which resulted in an estimated 120,000 fatalities, was followed by years of social and political instability. Sectarianism is a key element of Lebanese political life. Neighboring Syria has historically influenced Lebanon\'s foreign policy and internal policies, and its military occupied Lebanon from 1976 until 2005. The Lebanon-based Hizballah militia and Israel continued attacks and counterattacks against each other after Syria\'s withdrawal, and fought a brief war in 2006. Lebanon\'s borders with Syria and Israel remain unresolved.TipVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.Definitions and NotesArrow Right IconGeographyLocationMiddle East, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Israel and SyriaGeographic coordinates33 50 N, 35 50 EMap referencesMiddle EastAreatotal: 10,400 sq kmland: 10,230 sq kmwater: 170 sq kmcountry comparison to the world: 168Area - comparativeabout one-third the size of Marylandabout one-third the size of Maryland" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center"/>Area comparison mapEnlargeLand boundariestotal: 484 kmborder countries (2): Israel 81 km, Syria 403 kmCoastline225 kmMaritime claimsterritorial sea: 12 nmClimateMediterranean;
