On the cover
Four scientists who made major contributions to vaccine research and development (clockwise from
top left): Emil von Behring (1854-1917) – developed the first effective diphtheria antitoxin. For
this work he received the first Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology in 1901; Gaston Ramon
(1886-1963) – French veterinarian who in the 1920s developed methods for inactivating diphthe-
ria and tetanus toxoins, a critical discovery for the development of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids;
Maurice Hilleman (1919-2005) – researcher who developed numerous vaccines at Merck includ-
ing hepatitis B., mumps, and MMR vaccines; John Enders (1897-1985) – developed a method to
grow poliovirus using tissue culture media which led to the development of the first successful polio
vaccines. He and his coworkers received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1954 for this discovery. Dr.
Enders was also the first to isolate measles virus in 1954, which led to the first measles vaccine.
Images of these scientists appear in the animated "gallery" shown at the
beginning of all NCIRD broadcasts and video productions.

Principles of Vaccination
Principles of Vaccination
Immunology and Vaccine-Preventable
Diseases
Immunology is a complicated subject, and a detailed
discussion of it is beyond the scope of this text. However, an
understanding of the basic function of the immune system
is useful in order to understand both how vaccines work and
the basis of recommendations for their use. The description
that follows is simplified. Many excellent immunology
textbooks are available to provide additional detail.
Immunity is the ability of the human body to tolerate the
presence of material indigenous to the body (“self”), and to
eliminate foreign ("nonself") material. This discriminatory
ability provides protection from infectious disease, since
most microbes are identified as foreign by the immune
system. Immunity to a microbe is usually indicated by the
presence of antibody to that organism. Immunity is gener-
ally specific to a single organism or group of closely related
organisms. There are two basic mechanisms for acquiring
immunity, active and passive.
Principles of Vaccination
Immunity
• Self vs. nonself
• Protection from infectious disease
• Usually indicated by the presence
of antibody
• Very specific to a single organism
Active immunity is protection that is produced by the
person's own immune system. This type of immunity is
usually permanent.
Principles of Vaccination
Passive immunity is protection by products produced by
an animal or human and transferred to another human,
usually by injection. Passive immunity often provides effec-
tive protection, but this protection wanes (disappears) with
time, usually within a few weeks or months.
Active Immunity
• Protection produced by the person's
own immune system
• Usually permanent
Passive Immunity
Protection transferred from another
human or animal
Temporary protection that wanes
with time
.
The immune system is a complex system of interacting cells
whose primary purpose is to identify foreign (“nonself”)
substances referred to as antigens. Antigens can be either
live (such as viruses and bacteria) or inactivated. The
immune system develops a defense against the antigen.
This defense is known as the immune response and
usually involves the production of protein molecules by B
lymphocytes, called antibodies (or immunoglobulins), and of
specific cells (also known as cell-mediated immunity) whose
purpose is to facilitate the elimination of foreign substances.
Principles of Vaccination
Antigen
• A live or inactivated substance
(e.g., protein, polysaccharide)
capable of producing an immune
response
Antibody
• Protein molecules (immunoglobulin)
produced by B lymphocytes to help
eliminate an antigen
The most effective immune responses are generally
produced in response to a live antigen. However, an antigen
does not necessarily have to be alive, as occurs with infec-
tion with a virus or bacterium, to produce an immune
response. Some proteins, such as hepatitis B surface antigen,
are easily recognized by the immune system. Other material,
such as polysaccharide (long chains of sugar molecules that
make up the cell wall of certain bacteria) are less effective
antigens, and the immune response may not provide as
good protection.

Principles of Vaccination
Passive Immunity
• Transfer of antibody produced by
one human or other animal to
another
• Temporary protection
Transplacental most common
source in infancy
Passive Immunity
Passive immunity is the transfer of antibody produced by
one human or other animal to another. Passive immunity
provides protection against some infections, but this protec-
tion is temporary. The antibodies will degrade during a
period of weeks to months, and the recipient will no longer
be protected.
The most common form of passive immunity is that which
an infant receives from its mother. Antibodies are trans-
ported across the placenta during the last 1–2 months of
pregnancy. As a result, a full-term infant will have the same
antibodies as its mother. These antibodies will protect the
infant from certain diseases for up to a year. Protection is
better against some diseases (e.g., measles, rubella, tetanus)
than others (e.g., polio, pertussis).
Sources of Passive Immunity
Many types of blood products contain antibody. Some
products (e.g., washed or reconstituted red blood cells)
contain a relatively small amount of antibody, and some
(e.g., intravenous immune globulin and plasma products)
contain a large amount.
• Almost all blood or blood
products
• Homologous pooled human
antibody (immune globulin)
• Homologous human
hyperimmune globulin
Heterologous hyperimmune
serum (antitoxin)
In addition to blood products used for transfusion (e.g.,
whole blood, red cells, and platelets) there are three major
sources of antibody used in human medicine. These are
homologous pooled human antibody, homologous human
hyperimmune globulin, and heterologous hyperimmune
serum.
Homologous pooled human antibody is also known as
immune globulin. It is produced by combining (pooling)
the IgG antibody fraction from thousands of adult donors
in the United States. Because it comes from many different
donors, it contains antibody to many different antigens. It is
used primarily for postexposure prophylaxis for hepatitis A
and measles and treatment of certain congenital immuno-
globulin deficiencies.
Homologous human hyperimmune globulins are antibody
products that contain high titers of specific antibody. These
products are made from the donated plasma of humans
with high levels of the antibody of interest. However,
since hyperimmune globulins are from humans, they also
contain other antibodies in lesser quantities. Hyperimmune
globulins are used for postexposure prophylaxis for several
diseases, including hepatitis B, rabies, tetanus, and varicella.
Heterologous hyperimmune serum is also known as anti-
toxin. This product is produced in animals, usually horses
(equine), and contains antibodies against only one antigen.
In the United States, antitoxin is available for treatment of
botulism and diphtheria. A problem with this product is
serum sickness, an immune reaction to the horse protein.

Principles of Vaccination
Monoclonal Antibody
.
Immune globulin from human sources is polyclonal; it
contains many different kinds of antibodies. In the 1970s,
techniques were developed to isolate and “immortalize”
(cause to grow indefinitely) single B cells, which led to the
development of monoclonal antibody products. Monoclonal
antibody is produced from a single clone of B cells, so these
products contain antibody to only one antigen or closely
related group of antigens. Monoclonal antibody products
have many applications, including the diagnosis of certain
types of cancer (colorectal, prostate, ovarian, breast),
treatment of cancer (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
non-Hodgkin lymphoma), prevention of transplant rejection,
and treatment of autoimmune diseases (Crohn disease,
rheumatoid arthritis) and infectious diseases.
• Derived from a single type, or
clone, of antibody-producing cells
(B cells)
Antibody is specific to a single
antigen or closely related group of
antigens
• Used for diagnosis and therapy of
certain cancers and autoimmune
and infectious diseases
Antibody for Prevention of RSV
A monoclonal antibody product is available for the preven-
tion of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. It is called
palivizumab (Synagis). Palivizumab is a humanized mono-
clonal antibody specific for RSV. It does not contain any
other antibody except RSV antibody, and so will not interfere
with the response to a live virus vaccine.
• Palivizumab (Synagis)
-monoclonal
-contains only RSV antibody
-will not interfere with the
response to a live virus
vaccine
Active Immunity
Active immunity is stimulation of the immune system to
produce antigen-specific humoral (antibody) and cellular
immunity. Unlike passive immunity, which is temporary,
active immunity usually lasts for many years, often for a
lifetime.
Vaccination
• Active immunity produced by
vaccine
• Immunity and immunologic
memory similar to natural
infection but without risk of
disease
One way to acquire active immunity is to survive infection
with the disease-causing form of the organism. In general,
once persons recover from infectious diseases, they will
have lifelong immunity to that disease. The persistence of
protection for many years after the infection is known as
immunologic memory. Following exposure of the immune
system to an antigen, certain cells (memory B cells) continue
to circulate in the blood (and also reside in the bone
marrow) for many years. Upon reexposure to the antigen,
these memory cells begin to replicate and produce antibody
very rapidly to reestablish protection.
Another way to produce active immunity is by vaccination.
Vaccines interact with the immune system and often
produce an immune response similar to that produced by
the natural infection, but they do not subject the recipient
to the disease and its potential complications. Many
vaccines also produce immunologic memory similar to that
acquired by having the natural disease.
Many factors may influence the immune response to
vaccination. These include the presence of maternal antibody,
nature and dose of antigen, route of administration, and the
presence of an adjuvant (e.g., aluminum-containing material
3

added to improve the immunogenicity of the vaccine).
Host factors such as age, nutritional factors, genetics, and
coexisting disease, may also affect the response.
Classification of Vaccines
Classification of Vaccines
There are two basic types of vaccines: live attenuated and
inactivated. The characteristics of live and inactivated
vaccines are different, and these characteristics determine
how the vaccine is used.
• Live attenuated
– viral
- bacterial
• Inactivated
Live attenuated vaccines are produced by modifying a
disease-producing (“wild”) virus or bacterium in a laboratory.
The resulting vaccine organism retains the ability to
replicate (grow) and produce immunity, but usually does
not cause illness. The majority of live attenuated vaccines
available in the United States contain live viruses. However,
one live attenuated bacterial vaccine is available.
Inactivated Vaccines
Whole
• viruses
• bacteria
Fractional
• protein-based
- toxoid
- subunit
Inactivated vaccines can be composed of either whole
viruses or bacteria, or fractions of either. Fractional
vaccines are either protein-based or polysaccharide-based.
Protein-based vaccines include toxoids (inactivated
bacterial toxin) and subunit or subvirion products. Most
polysaccharide-based vaccines are composed of pure cell
wall polysaccharide from bacteria. Conjugate polysaccharide
vaccines contain polysaccharide that is chemically linked
to a protein. This linkage makes the polysaccharide a more
potent vaccine.
• polysaccharide-based
- pure
- conjugate
GENERAL RULE
The more similar a vaccine is to the disease-causing form
of the organism, the better the immune response to the
vaccine.
Live Attenuated Vaccines
• Attenuated (weakened) form of
the "wild" virus or bacterium
• Must replicate to be effective
• Immune response similar to
natural infection
• Usually produce immunity with
one dose*
Live Attenuated Vaccines
Live vaccines are derived from “wild,” or disease-causing,
viruses or bacteria. These wild viruses or bacteria are attenu-
ated, or weakened, in a laboratory, usually by repeated
culturing. For example, the measles virus used as a vaccine
today was isolated from a child with measles disease in 1954.
Almost 10 years of serial passage using tissue culture media
was required to transform the wild virus into attenuated
vaccine virus.
'except those administered orally
To produce an immune response, live attenuated vaccines
must replicate (grow) in the vaccinated person. A relatively
4


## p. 5 (#19) ###############################################

Principles of Vaccination
small dose of virus or bacteria is administered, which
replicates in the body and creates enough of the organism
to stimulate an immune response. Anything that either
damages the live organism in the vial (e.g., heat, light) or
interferes with replication of the organism in the body
(circulating antibody) can cause the vaccine to be ineffective.
Although live attenuated vaccines replicate, they usually do
not cause disease such as may occur with the “wild” form
of the organism. When a live attenuated vaccine does cause
"disease,” it is usually much milder than the natural disease
and is referred to as an adverse reaction.
The immune response to a live attenuated vaccine is virtu-
ally identical to that produced by a natural infection. The
immune system does not differentiate between an infection
with a weakened vaccine virus and an infection with a wild
virus. Live attenuated vaccines produce immunity in most
recipients with one dose, except those administered orally.
However, a small percentage of recipients do not respond
to the first dose of an injected live vaccine (such as MMR or
varicella) and a second dose is recommended to provide a
very high level of immunity in the population.
Live attenuated vaccines may cause severe or fatal reac-
tions as a result of uncontrolled replication (growth) of the
vaccine virus. This only occurs in persons with immunodefi-
ciency (e.g., from leukemia, treatment with certain drugs, or
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection).
Live Attenuated Vaccines
• Severe reactions possible
A live attenuated vaccine virus could theoretically revert to
its original pathogenic (disease-causing) form. This is known
to happen only with live (oral) polio vaccine.
• Interference from circulating
antibody
• Fragile – must be stored and
handled carefully
Active immunity from a live attenuated vaccine may not
develop because of interference from circulating antibody to
the vaccine virus. Antibody from any source (e.g., transpla-
cental, transfusion) can interfere with replication of the
vaccine organism and lead to poor response or no response
to the vaccine (also known as vaccine failure). Measles vaccine
virus seems to be most sensitive to circulating antibody. Polio
and rotavirus vaccine viruses are least affected.
Live attenuated vaccines are fragile and can be damaged
or destroyed by heat and light. They must be handled and
stored carefully.
Live Attenuated Vaccines
• Viral
measles, mumps,
rubella, vaccinia,
varicella, zoster,
yellow fever,
rotavirus, intranasal
influenza, oral polio*
Currently available live attenuated viral vaccines are
measles, mumps, rubella, vaccinia, varicella, zoster (which
contains the same virus as varicella vaccine but in much
higher amount), yellow fever, rotavirus, and influenza
(intranasal). Oral polio vaccine is a live viral vaccine but is
no longer available in the United States. Live attenuated
bacterial vaccines are bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG—not
currently available in the U.S.) and oral typhoid vaccine.
• Bacterial
BCG, oral typhoid
*not available in the United States

## p. 6 (#20) ###############################################

Principles of Vaccination
Inactivated Vaccines
• Cannot replicate
• Less interference from circulating
antibody than live vaccines
• Generally require 3-5 doses
• Immune response mostly humoral
• Antibody titer diminishes with time
Inactivated Vaccines
Inactivated vaccines are produced by growing the bacterium
or virus in culture media, then inactivating it with heat and/
or chemicals (usually formalin). In the case of fractional
vaccines, the organism is further treated to purify only those
components to be included in the vaccine (e.g., the polysac-
charide capsule of pneumococcus).
Inactivated vaccines are not alive and cannot replicate.
The entire dose of antigen is administered in the injection.
These vaccines cannot cause disease from infection, even in
an immunodeficient person. Inactivated antigens are less
affected by circulating antibody than are live agents, so they
may be given when antibody is present in the blood (e.g.,
in infancy or following receipt of antibody-containing blood
products).
Inactivated Vaccines
Whole-cell vaccines
• Viral
polio, hepatitis A,
rabies, influenza*
• Bacterial
pertussis“, typhoid*
cholera*, plague*
Inactivated vaccines always require multiple doses.
In general, the first dose does not produce protective
immunity, but “primes” the immune system. A protective
immune response develops after the second or third dose.
In contrast to live vaccines, in which the immune response
closely resembles natural infection, the immune response
to an inactivated vaccine is mostly humoral. Little or no
cellular immunity results. Antibody titers against inactivated
antigens diminish with time. As a result, some inactivated
vaccines may require periodic supplemental doses to
increase, or "boost,” antibody titers.
*not available in the United States
Inactivated Vaccines
Fractional vaccines
• Subunit hepatitis B, influenza,
acellular pertussis,
human papillomavirus,
anthrax
Currently available whole-cell inactivated vaccines are
limited to inactivated whole viral vaccines (polio, hepatitis
A, and rabies). Inactivated whole virus influenza vaccine
and whole inactivated bacterial vaccines (pertussis, typhoid,
cholera, and plague) are no longer available in the United
States. Fractional vaccines include subunits (hepatitis B,
influenza, acellular pertussis, human papillomavirus,
anthrax) and toxoids (diphtheria, tetanus). A subunit vaccine
for Lyme disease is no longer available in the United States.
• Toxoid
diphtheria, tetanus
Polysaccharide Vaccines
Pure polysaccharide
pneumococcal
• meningococcal
• Salmonella Typhi (Vi)
Polysaccharide Vaccines
Polysaccharide vaccines are a unique type of inactivated
subunit vaccine composed of long chains of sugar molecules
that make up the surface capsule of certain bacteria. Pure
polysaccharide vaccines are available for three diseases:
pneumococcal disease, meningococcal disease, and
Salmonella Typhi. A pure polysaccharide vaccine for
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is no longer available in
the United States.
Conjugate polysaccharide
• Haemophilus influenzae type b
• pneumococcal
• meningococcal
The immune response to a pure polysaccharide vaccine
is typically T-cell independent, which means that these
vaccines are able to stimulate B cells without the assistance
of T-helper cells. T-cell-independent antigens, including
6


## p. 7 (#21) ###############################################

Principles of Vaccination
Pure Polysaccharide Vaccines
polysaccharide vaccines, are not consistently immunogenic
in children younger than 2 years of age. Young children
do not respond consistently to polysaccharide antigens,
probably because of immaturity of the immune system.
• Not consistently immunogenic in
children younger than 2 years of age
• No booster response
• Antibody with less functional
activity
• Immunogenicity improved by
conjugation
Repeated doses of most inactivated protein vaccines cause
the antibody titer to go progressively higher, or "boost.”
This does not occur with polysaccharide antigens; repeat
doses of polysaccharide vaccines usually do not cause a
booster response. Antibody induced with polysaccharide
vaccines has less functional activity than that induced by
protein antigens. This is because the predominant antibody
produced in response to most polysaccharide vaccines is
IgM, and little IgG is produced.
In the late 1980s, it was discovered that the problems
noted above could be overcome through a process called
conjugation, in which the polysaccharide is chemically
combined with a protein molecule. Conjugation changes
the immune response from T-cell independent to T-cell
dependent, leading to increased immunogenicity in infants
and antibody booster response to multiple doses of vaccine.
The first conjugated polysaccharide vaccine was for Hib. A
conjugate vaccine for pneumococcal disease was licensed in
2000. A meningococcal conjugate vaccine was licensed in 2005.
Recombinant Vaccines
Vaccine antigens may also be produced by genetic engi-
neering technology. These products are sometimes referred
to as recombinant vaccines. Four genetically engineered
vaccines are currently available in the United States.
Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines
are produced by insertion of a segment of the respective
viral gene into the gene of a yeast cell. The modified yeast
cell produces pure hepatitis B surface antigen or HPV
capsid protein when it grows. Live typhoid vaccine (Ty21a)
is Salmonella Typhi bacteria that have been genetically
modified to not cause illness. Live attenuated influenza
vaccine has been engineered to replicate effectively in the
mucosa of the nasopharynx but not in the lungs.

General Recommendations on
Immunization
This chapter discusses issues that are commonly encountered
in vaccination practice. A more thorough discussion of issues
common to more than one vaccine can be found in the
General Recommendations on Immunization:
Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices. These recommendations are
revised every 3 to 5 years as needed; the most current
edition was published in January 2011 (MMWR 2011;60 (No.
RR-2):1-61. All providers who administer vaccine should
have a copy of this report and be familiar with its content.
It can be downloaded from the MMWR website or ordered
in print version from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
Timing and Spacing of Vaccines
The timing and spacing of vaccine doses are two of the most
important issues in the appropriate use of vaccines. Specific
circumstances that are commonly encountered in immu-
nization practice are the timing of antibody-containing
blood products and live vaccines (particularly measles and
varicella-containing vaccines), simultaneous and nonsimulta-
neous administration of different vaccines, and the interval
between subsequent doses of the same vaccine.
GENERAL RULE
Inactivated vaccines generally are not affected by circulating
antibody to the antigen.
Live attenuated vaccines may be affected by circulating
antibody to the antigen.
Antibody-Vaccine Interactions
The presence of circulating antibody to a vaccine antigen
may reduce or completely eliminate the immune response
to the vaccine. The amount of interference produced by
circulating antibody generally depends on the type of
vaccine administered and the amount of antibody.
Inactivated antigens are generally not affected by circulating
antibody, so they can be administered before, after, or at
the same time as the antibody. Simultaneous administration
of antibody (in the form of immune globulin) and vaccine
is recommended for postexposure prophylaxis of certain
diseases, such as hepatitis B, rabies, and tetanus.
Live Injected Vaccines
Live vaccines must replicate in order to cause an immune
response. Antibody against injected live vaccine antigen

Antibody and Measles- and
Varicella-Containing* Vaccines

Vaccine
Action
Wait 2 weeks before
giving antibody
may interfere with replication. If a live injectable vaccine
(measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), varicella, or combination
measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV]) must be given
around the time that antibody is given, the two must be
separated by enough time so that the antibody does not
interfere with viral replication. If the live vaccine is given
first, it is necessary to wait at least 2 weeks (i.e., an incuba-
tion period) before giving the antibody. If the interval
between the vaccine and antibody is less than 2 weeks, the
recipient should be tested for immunity or the vaccine dose
should be repeated.
Antibody
Wait 3 months or
longer before giving
vaccine
*except zoster vaccine
If the antibody is given before a dose of MMR or varicella
vaccine, it is necessary to wait until the antibody has waned
(degraded) before giving the vaccine to reduce the chance of
interference by the antibody. The necessary interval between
an antibody-containing product and MMR or varicella-
containing vaccine (except zoster vaccine) depends
on the concentration of antibody in the product, but is
always 3 months or longer. A table listing the recommended
intervals between administration of antibody products and
live vaccines (MMR and varicella-containing) is included
in Appendix A and in the General Recommendations on
Immunization (2011). The interval between administration of
an antibody product and MMR or varicella vaccination can
be as long as 11 months. Zoster vaccine is not known to be
affected by circulating antibody so it can be administered at
any time before or after receipt of an antibody-containing
blood product.
Yellow fever vaccine also is not known to be affected by
circulating antibody. Because few North Americans are
immune to yellow fever, these products do not contain
significant amounts of antibody to yellow fever virus.
Although passively acquired antibodies can interfere with
the response to rubella vaccine, the low dose of anti-Rho(D)
globulin administered to postpartum women has not been
demonstrated to reduce the response to the rubella vaccine.
Because of the importance of rubella and varicella immunity
among childbearing age women, women without evidence
of immunity to rubella or varicella should receive MMR or
varicella vaccine (but not MMRV) in the postpartum period.
Vaccination should not be delayed because of receipt of anti-
Rho(D) globulin or any other blood product during the last
trimester of pregnancy or at delivery. These women should
be vaccinated immediately after delivery and, if possible,
tested 3 months later to ensure immunity to rubella and, if
necessary, to measles.
Live Oral and Intranasal Vaccines
Oral typhoid vaccine is not known to be affected by the
administration of immune globulin or blood products. Oral

typhoid vaccine may be given simultaneously with blood
products, or separated by any interval. The replication of
live attenuated influenza (LAIV) and rotavirus vaccines are
not believed to be affected by antibody-containing blood
products. These can be given any time before or after
administration of antibody-containing blood products.
Products Containing Type-Specific or Negligible
Antibody
Some blood products do not contain antibodies that
interfere with vaccine replication. Palivizumab (Synagis),
used for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
infection in infants and young children, contains antibody
directed only at RSV. Washed red blood cells contain a
negligible amount of antibody. These products can be given
anytime before or after administration of MMR or varicella-
containing vaccines.
Products Containing Type-Specific
or Negligible Antibody
• Palivizumab (Synagis)
-monoclonal
-contains only RSV antibody
• Red blood cells (RBCs), washed
-negligible antibody content
Simultaneous and Nonsimultaneous
Administration
GENERAL RULE
All vaccines can be administered at the same
visit as all other vaccines.
Simultaneous administration (that is, administration on
the same day) of the most widely used live and inactivated
vaccines does not result in decreased antibody responses
or increased rates of adverse reaction. Simultaneous
administration of all vaccines for which a child is eligible
is very important in childhood vaccination programs
because it increases the probability that a child will be fully
immunized at the appropriate age. A study during a measles
outbreak in the early 1990s showed that about one-third of
measles cases in unvaccinated but vaccine-eligible preschool
children could have been prevented if MMR had been
administered at the same visit when another vaccine was
given.
Although all indicated vaccines should be administered
at the same visit, individual vaccines should not be mixed
in the same syringe unless they are licensed for mixing by
the Food and Drug Administration. Only the sanofi-pasteur
DTP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel) vaccine is licensed for mixing in the
same syringe. See Appendix D for additional guidelines for
vaccine administration.
Combination vaccines are generally preferred over simul-
taneous administration of single component vaccines.
Considerations should include an assessment of the number
11

General Recommendations on Immunization
of injections, vaccine availability, likelihood of improved
coverage, likelihood of patient return, and storage and costs.
Considerations should also include patient choice and the
potential for adverse events. For the first dose of vaccine to
prevent measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, unless the
parent or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV vaccine,
separate MMR and Varicella vaccines should be administered
for children 12 through 47 months of age.

Nonsimultaneous Administration of Different
Vaccines
In some situations, vaccines that could be given at the same
visit are not. If live parenteral (injected) vaccines (MMR,
MMRV, varicella, zoster, and yellow fever) and live intranasal
influenza vaccine (LAIV) are not administered at the same
visit, they should be separated by at least 4 weeks. This
interval is intended to reduce or eliminate interference from
the vaccine given first on the vaccine given later. If two live
parenteral vaccines or LAIV are not administered on the
same day but are separated by less than 4 weeks, the vaccine
given second should be repeated in 4 weeks or confirmed to
have been effective by serologic testing of the recipient (sero-
logic testing is not recommended following LAIV, varicella,
or zoster vaccines). An exception to this recommendation is
yellow fever vaccine administered less than 4 weeks after
single-antigen measles vaccine. A 1999 study demonstrated
that yellow fever vaccine is not affected by measles vaccine
given 1-27 days earlier. The effect of nonsimultaneously
administered yellow fever vaccine with each of the following
vaccines: mumps; varicella; zoster; LAIV; and rubella is not

None
Spacing of Live Vaccines not
Given Simultaneously
• If two live parenteral vaccines, or
live intranasal influenza vaccine,
are given less than 4 weeks apart
the vaccine given second should
be repeated
• Exception is yellow fever vaccine
given less than 4 weeks after
measles vaccine
Live vaccines administered by the oral route (oral polio
vaccine (OPV] oral typhoid, and rotavirus) are not believed to
interfere with each other if not given simultaneously. These
vaccines may be given at any time before or after each other.
Rotavirus vaccine is not approved for children older than
32 weeks, oral typhoid is not approved for children younger
than 6 years of age, and OPV is no longer available in the
United States, so these vaccines are not likely to be given to
the same child.
Parenteral live vaccines (MMR, MMRV, varicella, zoster, and
yellow fever) and LAIV are not believed to have an effect on
live vaccines given by the oral route (OPV, oral typhoid, and
rotavirus). Live oral vaccines may be given at any time before
or after live parenteral vaccines or LAIV.
All other combinations of two inactivated vaccines, or live
and inactivated vaccines, may be given at any time before or
after each other.

General Recommendations on Immunization
2.
Interval Between Doses of the Same Vaccine
Immunizations are recommended for members of the
youngest age group at risk for a disease for whom efficacy
and safety of a vaccine have been demonstrated.
GENERAL RULE
Increasing the interval between doses of a multidose vaccine
does not diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine.
Decreasing the interval between doses of a multidose vaccine
may interfere with antibody response and protection.
Most vaccines in the childhood immunization schedule
require two or more doses for development of an adequate
and persisting antibody response. Studies have demon-
strated that recommended ages and intervals between
doses of the same antigen(s) provide optimal protection or
have the best evidence of efficacy. Table 1 of the General
Recommendations on Immunization (included in Appendix
A) shows the recommended and minimal ages and intervals
between doses of vaccines most frequently used in the
United States.
Administering doses of a multidose vaccine at shorter than
the recommended intervals might be necessary when an
infant or child is behind schedule and needs to be brought
up-to-date quickly or when international travel is pending.
In these cases, an accelerated schedule using the minimum
age or minimum interval criteria can be used. Accelerated
schedules should not be used routinely.
Minimum Intervals and Ages
Vaccine doses should not be
administered at intervals less
than the minimum intervals or
earlier than the minimum age
Vaccine doses should not be administered at intervals less
than the recommended minimal intervals or earlier than
the minimal ages. Two exceptions to this may occur. The
first is for measles vaccine during a measles outbreak, when
the vaccine may be administered at an age younger than
12 months (this dose would not be counted, and should
be repeated at 12 months of age or older). The second
exception involves administering a dose a few days earlier
than the minimum interval or age, which is unlikely to have
a substantially negative effect on the immune response to
that dose. Although vaccinations should not be scheduled at
an interval or age less than the recommended minimums, a
child may have erroneously been brought to the office early,
or may have come for an appointment not specifically for
vaccination. In these situations, the clinician can consider
administering the vaccine earlier than the minimum
interval or age. If the parent/child is known to the clinician
and is reliable, it is preferable to reschedule the child for
vaccination closer to the recommended interval. If the
parent/child is not known to the clinician or is not reliable
13


## p. 14 (#28) ##############################################

General Recommendations on Immunization
(e.g., habitually misses appointments), it may be preferable
to administer the vaccine at that visit than to reschedule a
later appointment that may not be kept.
Vaccine doses administered up to 4 days before the
minimum interval or age can be counted as valid. This 4-day
recommendation does not apply to rabies vaccine because
of the unique schedule for this vaccine. Doses administered
5 days or earlier than the minimum interval or age should
not be counted as valid doses and should be repeated as
age appropriate. The repeat dose should generally be spaced
after the invalid dose by an interval at least equal to the
recommended minimum interval shown in Table 1 of the
General Recommendations. In certain situations, local or
state requirements might mandate that doses of selected
vaccines be administered on or after specific ages, super-
seding this 4-day “grace period”.
Violation of Minimum Intervals
or Minimum Age
• ACIP recommends that vaccine
doses given up to 4 days before
the minimum interval or age be
counted as valid
• Immunization programs and/or
school entry requirements may
not accept all doses given earlier
than the minimum age or interval
Extended Interval Between Doses
In some cases, a scheduled dose of vaccine may not be given
on time. If this occurs, the dose should be given at the next
visit. Not all permutations of all schedules for all vaccines
have been studied. However, available data indicate that
intervals between doses longer than those routinely recom-
mended do not affect seroconversion rate or titer when the
schedule is completed. Consequently, it is not necessary to
restart the series or add doses of any vaccine because of an
extended interval between doses. The only exception to
this rule is oral typhoid vaccine in some circumstances.
Some experts recommend repeating the series of oral
typhoid vaccine if the four-dose series is extended to more
than 3 weeks.
• Not all permutations of all
schedules for all vaccines have
been studied
• Available studies of extended
intervals have shown no
significant difference in final titer
• It is not necessary to restart the
series or add doses because of
an extended interval between
doses
Number of Doses
For live injected vaccines, the first dose administered at the
recommended age usually provides protection. An additional
dose is given to provide another opportunity for vaccine
response in the small proportion of recipients who do not
respond to the first dose. For instance, 95%-98% of recipients
will respond to a single dose of measles vaccine. The second
dose is given to ensure that nearly 100% of persons are
immune (i.e., the second dose is “insurance”). Immunity
following live vaccines is long-lasting, and booster
doses are not necessary.
For inactivated vaccines, the first dose administered at the
recommended age usually does not provide protection
(hepatitis A vaccine is an exception). A protective immune
response may not develop until the second or third dose.
For inactivated vaccines, antibody titers may decrease (wane)
below protective levels after a few years. This phenomenon
is most notable for tetanus and diphtheria. For these vaccines,
periodic “boosting” is required. An additional dose is given
to raise antibody back to protective levels.
14


## p. 15 (#29) ##############################################

General Recommendations on Immunization
2
Not all inactivated vaccines require boosting throughout life.
For example, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine
does not require boosting because Hib disease is very rare in
children older than 5 years of age. Hepatitis B vaccine does
not require boosting because of immunologic memory to the
vaccine and the long incubation period of hepatitis B (which
can produce an “autoboost”).
Vaccine Adverse Reactions
• Adverse reaction
- extraneous effect caused by
vaccine
- side effect
Adverse Reactions Following
Vaccination
Vaccines are intended to produce active immunity to specific
antigens. An adverse reaction is an untoward effect caused
by a vaccine that is extraneous to the vaccine's primary
purpose of producing immunity. Adverse reactions are also
called vaccine side effects. A vaccine adverse event refers
to any medical event that occurs following vaccination. An
adverse event could be a true adverse reaction or just a coin-
cidental event, with further research needed to distinguish
between them.
• Adverse event
any event following vaccination
- may be true adverse reaction
- may be only coincidental
Vaccine adverse reactions fall into three general categories:
local, systemic, and allergic. Local reactions are generally
the least severe and most frequent. Allergic reactions are the
most severe and least frequent.
Vaccine Adverse Reactions
• Local
- pain, swelling, redness at
site of injection
- common with inactivated
vaccines
– usually mild and self-limited
The most common type of adverse reactions are local
reactions, such as pain, swelling, and redness at the site
of injection. Local reactions may occur with up to 80% of
vaccine doses, depending on the type of vaccine. Local
reactions are most common with inactivated vaccines,
particularly those, such as DTP, that contain an adjuvant.
Local adverse reactions generally occur within a few hours of
the injection and are usually mild and self-limited. On rare
occasions, local reactions may be very exaggerated or severe.
Some of these reactions, referred to as Arthus reactions, are
commonly seen with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. Arthus
reactions are not allergy. Arthus reactions are believed to
be due to very high titers of antibody, usually caused by too
many doses of toxoid.
Vaccine Adverse Reactions
• Systemic
- fever, malaise, headache
- nonspecific
- may be unrelated to vaccine
Systemic adverse reactions are more generalized events and
include fever, malaise, myalgias (muscle pain), headache,
loss of appetite, and others. These symptoms are common
and nonspecific; they may occur in vaccinated persons
because of the vaccine or may be caused by something unre-
lated to the vaccine, like a concurrent viral infection, stress,
or excessive alcohol consumption.
Systemic adverse reactions were relatively frequent with DTP
vaccine, which contained a whole-cell pertussis component.
However, comparison of the frequency of systemic adverse
events among vaccine and placebo recipients shows they
15


## p. 16 (#30) ##############################################

General Recommendations on Immunization
are less common with inactivated vaccines currently in use,
including acellular pertussis vaccine.
Live Attenuated Vaccines
• Must replicate to produce
immunity
• Symptoms usually mild
• Occur after an incubation period
(usually 7-21 days)
Systemic adverse reactions may occur following receipt of
live attenuated vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines must repli-
cate in order to produce immunity. The adverse reactions
that follow live attenuated vaccines, such as fever or rash,
represent symptoms produced from viral replication and
are similar to a mild form of the natural disease. Systemic
adverse reactions following live vaccines are usually mild,
and occur 7-21 days after the vaccine was given (i.e., after
an incubation period of the vaccine virus). LAIV replicates
in the mucous membranes of the nose and throat, not in
the lung. As a result, LAIV may cause upper respiratory
symptoms (like a cold) but not influenza-like symptoms.
Vaccine Adverse Reactions
• Allergic
- due to vaccine or vaccine
component
- rare
– risk minimized by screening
A third type of vaccine adverse reaction is a severe (anaphy-
lactic) allergic reaction. The allergic reaction may be caused
by the vaccine antigen itself or some other component of the
vaccine, such as cell culture material, stabilizer, preservative,
or antibiotic used to inhibit bacterial growth.
Severe allergic reactions may be life-threatening. Fortunately,
they are rare, occurring at a rate of less than one in half a
million doses. The risk of an allergic reaction can be mini-
mized by good screening prior to vaccination. All providers
who administer vaccines must have an emergency protocol
and supplies to treat anaphylaxis.
Reporting Vaccine Adverse Events
From 1978 to 1990, CDC conducted the Monitoring System
for Adverse Events Following Immunization (MSAEFI) in the
public sector. In 1990, MSAEFI was replaced by the Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which includes
reporting from both public and private sectors. Providers
should report any clinically significant adverse event that
occurs after the administration of any vaccine licensed in the
United States.
Providers should report a clinically significant adverse event
even if they are unsure whether a vaccine caused the event.
The telephone number to call for answers to questions and
to obtain VAERS forms is (800) 822-7967, or visit the VAERS
website at http://vaers.hhs.gov. VAERS now accepts reports of
adverse reactions through their online system. (See Vaccine
Safety chapter.)
Contraindication
• A condition in a recipient that
greatly increases the chance of a
serious adverse reaction
Contratacications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Contraindications and precautions to vaccination generally
dictate circumstances when vaccines will not be given. Most
contraindications and precautions are temporary, and the
vaccine can be given at a later time.
16


## p. 17 (#31) ##############################################

General Recommendations on Immunization
2
A contraindication is a condition in a recipient that greatly
increases the chance of a serious adverse reaction. It is
a condition in the recipient of the vaccine, not with the
vaccine per se. If the vaccine were given in the presence of
that condition, the resulting adverse reaction could seriously
harm the recipient. For instance, administering influenza
vaccine to a person with a true anaphylactic allergy to
egg could cause serious illness or death in the recipient.
In general, vaccines should not be administered when a
contraindication condition is present.
Precaution
• A condition in a recipient that
might increase the chance or
severity of an adverse reaction,
or
• Might compromise the ability of
the vaccine to produce immunity
A precaution is similar to a contraindication. A precaution is
a condition in a recipient that might increase the chance or
severity of a serious adverse reaction, or that might compro-
mise the ability of the vaccine to produce immunity (such
as administering measles vaccine to a person with passive
immunity to measles from a blood transfusion). Injury
could result, but the chance of this happening is less than
with a contraindication. In general, vaccines are deferred
when a precaution condition is present. However, situations
may arise when the benefit of protection from the vaccine
outweighs the risk of an adverse reaction, and a provider
may decide to give the vaccine. For example, prolonged
crying or a high fever after a dose of whole-cell or acel-
lular pertussis vaccine is considered to be a precaution to
subsequent doses of pediatric pertussis vaccine. But if the
child were at high risk of pertussis exposure (e.g., during
a pertussis outbreak in the community), a provider may
choose to vaccinate the child and treat the adverse reaction
if it occurs. In this example, the benefit of protection from
the vaccine outweighs the harm potentially caused by the
vaccine.
Contraindications and Precautions
There are very few true contraindication and precaution
conditions. Only three of these conditions are generally
considered to be permanent: severe (anaphylactic) allergic
reaction to a vaccine component or following a prior dose of
a vaccine; encephalopathy not due to another identifiable
cause occurring within 7 days of pertussis vaccination; and
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) as a contraindica-
tion to rotavirus vaccine.
Permanent contraindications to
vaccination:
• severe allergic reaction to a vaccine
component or following a prior dose (all
vaccines)
• encephalopathy not due to another
identifiable cause occurring within 7 days
of pertussis vaccination (pertussis
vaccine)
• severe combined immunodeficiency
(rotavirus vaccine)
Contraindications and Precautions
Live Inactivated
Conditions considered permanent precautions to further
doses of pediatric pertussis-containing vaccine are tempera-
ture of 105°F or higher within 48 hours of a dose, collapse
or shock-like state (hypotonic hyporesponsive episode)
within 48 hours of a dose, persistent inconsolable crying
lasting 3 or more hours occurring within 48 hours of a dose,
or a seizure, with or without fever, occurring within 3 days
of a dose. The occurrence of one of these events in a child
following DTP vaccine is not a precaution to later vaccina-
tion with the adolescent/adult formulation of pertussis
vaccine (Tdap).

Two conditions are temporary contraindications to vaccina-
tion with live vaccines: pregnancy and immunosuppression.
Two conditions are temporary precautions to vaccination:
moderate or severe acute illness (all vaccines), and recent
receipt of an antibody-containing blood product. The latter
precaution applies only to MMR and varicella-containing
(except zoster) vaccines.
Allergy
A severe (anaphylactic) allergic reaction following a dose of
vaccine will almost always contraindicate a subsequent dose
of that vaccine. Anaphylactic allergies are those that are
mediated by IgE, occur within minutes or hours of receiving
the vaccine, and require medical attention. Examples of
symptoms and signs typical of anaphylactic reactions are
generalized urticaria (hives), swelling of the mouth and
throat, difficulty breathing, wheezing, hypotension, or
shock. With appropriate screening these reactions are very
rare following vaccination.
A table listing vaccine contents is included in Appendix
B. Persons may be allergic to the vaccine antigen or to
a vaccine component such as animal protein, antibiotic,
preservative, or stabilizer. The most common animal protein
allergen is egg protein found in vaccines prepared using
embryonated chicken eggs (e.g., yellow fever and influenza
vaccines). Ordinarily, a person who can eat eggs or egg
products can receive vaccines that contain egg; persons with
histories of anaphylactic or anaphylactic-like allergy to eggs
or egg proteins should not. Asking persons whether they
can eat eggs without adverse effects is a reasonable way to
screen for those who might be at risk from receiving yellow
fever and influenza vaccines.
Several recent studies have shown that children who have
a history of severe allergy to eggs rarely have reactions to
MMR vaccine. This is probably because measles and mumps
vaccine viruses are both grown in chick embryo fibroblasts,
not actually in eggs. It appears that gelatin, not egg, might
be the cause of allergic reactions to MMR. As a result, in
1998, the ACIP removed severe egg allergy as a contraindica-
tion to measles and mumps vaccines. Egg-allergic children
may be vaccinated with MMR without prior skin testing.
Certain vaccines contain trace amounts of neomycin.
Persons who have experienced an anaphylactic reaction to
neomycin should not receive these vaccines. Most often,
neomycin allergy presents as contact dermatitis, a manifes-
tation of a delayed-type (cell-mediated) immune response,
rather than anaphylaxis. A history of delayed-type reactions
to neomycin is not a contraindication for administration of
vaccines that contain neomycin.

Latex is sap from the commercial rubber tree. Latex contains
naturally occurring impurities (e.g., plant proteins and
peptides), which are believed to be responsible for allergic
reactions. Latex is processed to form natural rubber latex
and dry natural rubber. Dry natural rubber and natural
rubber latex might contain the same plant impurities as
latex but in lesser amounts. Natural rubber latex is used to
produce medical gloves, catheters, and other products. Dry
natural rubber is used in syringe plungers, vial stoppers,
and injection ports on intravascular tubing. Synthetic rubber
and synthetic latex also are used in medical gloves, syringe
plungers, and vial stoppers. Synthetic rubber and synthetic
latex do not contain natural rubber or natural latex, and
therefore, do not contain the impurities linked to allergic
reactions.
The most common type of latex sensitivity is contact-type
(type 4) allergy, usually as a result of prolonged contact with
latex-containing gloves. However, injection-procedure-
associated latex allergies among diabetic patients have
been described. Allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis)
after vaccination procedures are rare. Only one report of an
allergic reaction after administration of hepatitis B vaccine
in a patient with known severe allergy (anaphylaxis) to latex
has been published.
If a person reports a severe (anaphylactic) allergy to latex,
vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain natural
rubber should not be administered unless the benefit of
vaccination clearly outweighs the risk of an allergic reaction
to the vaccine. For latex allergies other than anaphylactic
allergies (e.g., a history of contact allergy to latex gloves),
vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain dry
natural rubber or natural rubber latex can be administered.
Vaccination of Pregnant Women
Pregnancy
The concern with vaccination of a pregnant woman is infec-
tion of the fetus and is theoretical. Only smallpox (vaccinia)
vaccine has been shown to cause fetal injury. However, since
the theoretical possibility exists, live vaccines should not be
administered to women known to be pregnant.
• Live vaccines should not be
administered to women known to
be pregnant
• In general inactivated vaccines
may be administered to pregnant
women for whom they are
indicated
• HPV vaccine should be deferred
during pregnancy
Since inactivated vaccines cannot replicate, they cannot
cause fetal infection. In general, inactivated vaccines may
be administered to pregnant women for whom they are
indicated. An exception is human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccine, which should be deferred during pregnancy
because of a lack of safety and efficacy data for this vaccine
in pregnant women.
Pregnant women are at increased risk of complications of
influenza. Any woman who will be pregnant during influ-
enza season (generally December through March) should
19


## p. 20 (#34) ##############################################

General Recommendations on Immunization
receive inactivated influenza vaccine. Pregnant women
should not receive live attenuated influenza vaccine.
Any woman who might become pregnant is encouraged to
receive a single dose of Tdap if she has not already received
a dose. Women who have not received Tdap should receive a
dose in the immediate postpartum period, before discharge
from the hospital or birthing center.
Use of Tdap Among
Pregnant Women
Any woman who might become pregnant is
encouraged to receive a single dose of Tdap
• Women who have not received Tdap should
receive a dose in the immediate postpartum
period
• ACIP recommends Td when tetanus and
diphtheria protection is required during
pregnancy
Pregnancy is not a contraindication for Tdap
• Clinician may choose to administer Tdap to a
pregnant woman in certain circumstances (such
as during a community pertussis outbreak)
MMWR 2008;57(RR-4)
ACIP recommends Td when tetanus and diphtheria protec-
tion is required during pregnancy. However, pregnancy
is not a contraindication for use of Tdap. A clinician may
choose to administer Tdap to a pregnant woman in certain
circumstances, such as during a community pertussis
outbreak. When Td or Tdap is administered during preg-
nancy, the second or third trimester is preferred to avoid
coincidental association of vaccination and spontaneous
termination of a pregnancy, which is more common in the
first trimester. Clinicians can choose to administer Tdap
instead of Td to protect against pertussis in pregnant adoles-
cents for routine or "catch-up" vaccination because the inci-
dence of pertussis is high among adolescents. They also may
consider Tdap for pregnant healthcare personnel and child
care providers to prevent transmission to infants younger
than 12 months of age and other vulnerable persons, and
for pregnant women employed in an institution or living in
a community with increased pertussis activity.
Susceptible household contacts of pregnant women should
receive MMR and varicella vaccines, and may receive LAIV,
zoster and rotavirus vaccines if they are otherwise eligible.
Vaccination of
Immunosuppressed Persons
• Live vaccines should not be
administered to severely
immunosuppressed persons
• Persons with isolated B-cell
deficiency may receive varicella
vaccine
• Inactivated vaccines are safe to
use in immunosuppressed
persons but the response to the
vaccine may be decreased
Immunosuppression
Live vaccines can cause severe or fatal reactions in immuno-
suppressed persons due to uncontrolled replication of the
vaccine virus. Live vaccines should not be administered to
severely immunosuppressed persons for this reason. Persons
with isolated B-cell deficiency may receive varicella vaccine.
Inactivated vaccines cannot replicate, so they are safe to use
in immunosuppressed persons. However, response to the
vaccine may be decreased.
Immunosuppression
Disease
-congenital immunodeficiency
-leukemia or lymphoma
-generalized malignancy
Both diseases and drugs can cause significant immunosup-
pression. Persons with congenital immunodeficiency,
leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy should not
receive live vaccines. However, MMR, varicella, rotavirus,
and LAIV vaccines may be given when an immunosup-
pressed person lives in the same house. Household contacts
of immunosuppressed persons may receive zoster vaccine if
indicated. Transmission has not been documented from a
person who received zoster vaccine.
• Chemotherapy
-alkylating agents
-antimetabolites
-radiation
Certain drugs may cause immunosuppression. For instance,
20


## p. 21 (#35) ##############################################

General Recommendations on Immunization
2
persons receiving cancer treatment with alkylating agents or
antimetabolites, or radiation therapy should not be given
live vaccines. Live vaccines can be given after chemotherapy
has been discontinued for at least 3 months. Persons
receiving large doses of corticosteroids should not receive
live vaccines. For example, this would include persons
receiving 20 milligrams or more of prednisone daily or 2 or
more milligrams of prednisone per kilogram of body weight
per day for 14 days or longer. See Varicella chapter for more
information about administration of zoster vaccine to immu-
nosuppressed persons.
Immunosuppression
Aerosolized steroids, such as inhalers for asthma, are not
contraindications to vaccination, nor are alternate-day,
rapidly tapering, and short (less than 14 days) high-dose
schedules, topical formulations, and physiologic replacement
schedules.
• Corticosteroids
-20 mg or more per day
of prednisone*
-2 mg/kg or more per day of
prednisone*
-NOT aerosols, alternate-day,

topical
"for 14 days or longer
The safety and efficacy of live attenuated vaccines admin-
istered concurrently with recombinant human immune
mediators and immune modulators are not known. There
is evidence that use of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies,
especially the anti-tumor necrosis factor agents adalimumab,
infliximab, and etanercept, may lead to reactivation of latent
tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis disease and predis-
pose to other opportunistic infections. Because the safety of
live attenuated vaccines for persons receiving these drugs
is not known, it is prudent to avoid administration of live
attenuated vaccines for at least a month following treatment
with these drugs.
Inactivated vaccines may be administered to immunosup-
pressed persons. Certain vaccines are recommended or
encouraged specifically because immunosuppression is a risk
factor for complications from vaccine-preventable diseases
(i.e., influenza, invasive pneumococcal disease, invasive
meningococcal disease, invasive Haemophilus influenzae type
b disease, and hepatitis B). However, response to the vaccine
may be poor depending on the degree of immunosuppres-
sion present. Because a relatively functional immune system
is required to develop an immune response to a vaccine,
an immunosuppressed person may not be protected even if
the vaccine has been given. Additional recommendations for
vaccination of immunosuppressed persons are detailed in
the General Recommendations on Immunization.
HIV Infection
Persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
may have no symptoms, or they may be severely immuno-
suppressed. In general, the same vaccination recommenda-
tions apply as with other types of immunosuppression.
Live-virus vaccines are usually contraindicated, but inactivated
vaccines may be administered if indicated.

Live Attenuated Vaccines
for Persons with HIV/AIDS*
Varicella and measles can be very severe illnesses in persons
with HIV infection and are often associated with complications.
Varicella vaccine can be considered for persons with HIV
infection who are not severely immunosuppressed. Zoster
vaccine should not be given to persons with AIDS or clinical
manifestations of HIV infection. Measles vaccine (as combi-
nation MMR vaccine) is recommended for persons with HIV
infection who are asymptomatic or mildly immunosup-
pressed. However, persons with severe immunosuppression
due to HIV infection should not receive measles vaccine or
MMR. MMRV should not be administered to persons with
HIV infection. Persons with HIV infection should not receive
LAIV; they should receive inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV).
Yellow fever vaccine should be considered for persons who
do not have AIDS or other symptomatic manifestations of
HIV infection, who have established laboratory verification
of adequate immune system function, and who cannot
avoid potential exposure to yellow fever virus.

Vaccination of Hematopoietic Cell Transplant
Recipients
Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is the infusion of hema-
topoietic cells from a donor into a patient who has received
chemotherapy and often radiation, both of which are
usually bone marrow ablative. HCT is used to treat a variety
of neoplastic diseases, hematologic disorders, immunode-
ficiency syndromes, congenital enzyme deficiencies, and
autoimmune disorders. HCT recipients can receive either
their own cells (i.e., autologous HCT) or cells from a donor
other than the transplant recipient (i.e., allogeneic HCT).
Vaccination of Hematopoietic Cell
Transplant (HCT) Recipients
• Antibody titers to VPDs decline during
the 1-4 years after allogeneic or
autologous HCT if the recipient is not
revaccinated
• HCT recipients are at increased risk of
some VPDs, particularly pneumococcal
disease
• Revaccination recommended beginning
6-12 months post-transplant
MMWR 2011;60(No. RR-2)
Antibody titers to vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., tetanus,
poliovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, and encapsulated
bacteria [i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus
influenzae type b]) decline during the 1-4 years after alloge-
neic or autologous HCT if the recipient is not revaccinated.
HCT recipients are at increased risk for certain vaccine-
preventable diseases. As a result, HCT recipients should be
routinely revaccinated after HCT, regardless of the source
of the transplanted cells. Revaccination with inactivated
vaccines should begin 6 months after HCT. Influenza vaccine
also should be administered at 6 months after HCT, but can
be given as early as 4 months after HCT. It this circumstance
an additional dose should be given. Influenza vaccine
should be given annually thereafter for the life of the
recipient. Three doses of PCV should be given 6 months after
HCT, followed by a dose of PPSV. Revaccination to prevent
pertussis should involve a primary series of DTap followed
by a Tdap booster. A dose of MCV4 should be given.
22


## p. 23 (#37) ##############################################

General Recommendations on Immunization
MMR and varicella vaccines should be administered
24 months after transplantation if the HCT recipient is
presumed to be immunocompetent.
Household and other close contacts of HCT recipients and
healthcare providers who care for HCT recipients should
be appropriately vaccinated, particularly against influenza,
measles, and varicella. Additional details of vaccination of
HCT recipients and their contacts can be found in the ACIP
statement titled General Recommendations on Immunization.
Moderate or Severe Acute liness
There is no evidence that a concurrent acute illness reduces
vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events.
The concern is that an adverse event (particularly fever)
following vaccination could complicate the management of
a severely ill person. If a person has a moderate or severe
acute illness, vaccination with both live and inactivated
vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved.
Invalid Contraindications to
Vaccination
Some healthcare providers inappropriately consider certain
conditions or circumstances to be true contraindica-
tions or precautions to vaccinations. Such conditions or
circumstances are known as invalid contraindications; these
misperceptions result in missed opportunities to administer
needed vaccines. Some of the most common invalid contra-
indications are mild illnesses, conditions related to preg-
nancy and breastfeeding, allergies that are not anaphylactic
in nature, and certain aspects of the patient's family history.
Invalid Contraindications
to Vaccination
• Mild illness
• Antimicrobial therapy
• Disease exposure or convalescence
• Pregnant or immunosuppressed person in
the household
• Breastfeeding
• Preterm birth
• Allergy to products not present in vaccine or
allergy that is not anaphylactic
• Family history of adverse events
• Tuberculin skin test
Multiple vaccines
.
Mild Illness
Children with mild acute illnesses, such as low-grade fever,
upper respiratory infection (URI), colds, otitis media, and
mild diarrhea, should be vaccinated on schedule. Several
large studies have shown that young children with URI, otitis
media, diarrhea, and/or fever respond to measles vaccine as
well as those without these conditions. There is no evidence
that mild diarrhea reduces the success of immunization of
infants in the United States.
Low-grade fever is not a contraindication to immunization.
Temperature measurement is not necessary before immu-
nization if the infant or child does not appear ill and the
parent does not say the child is currently ill. ACIP has not
defined a body temperature above which vaccines should
not be administered. The decision to vaccinate should be
based on the overall evaluation of the person rather than an
arbitrary body temperature.

General Recommendations on Immunization
Antimicrobial Therapy
Antibiotics do not have an effect on the immune response to
most vaccines. The manufacturer advises that Ty21a oral
typhoid vaccine should not be administered to persons
receiving sulfonamides or other antibiotics; Ty21a should be
administered at least 24 hours after a dose of an antibacte-
rial drug.
No commonly used antimicrobial drug will inactivate a
live-virus vaccine. However, antiviral drugs may affect
vaccine replication in some circumstances. Live attenuated
influenza vaccine should not be administered until 48 hours
after cessation of therapy using antiviral drugs active against
influenza (amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, oseltamivir).
Antiviral drugs active against herpesviruses (acyclovir, famci-
clovir) should be discontinued 24 hours before administra-
tion of a varicella-containing vaccine, if possible.
Disease Exposure or Convalescence
If a person is not moderately or severely ill, he or she
should be vaccinated. There is no evidence that either
disease exposure or convalescence will affect the response to
a vaccine or increase the likelihood of an adverse event.
Pregnant or Immunosuppressed Person in the
Household
It is critical that healthy household contacts of pregnant
women and immunosuppressed persons be vaccinated.
Vaccination of healthy contacts reduces the chance of
exposure of pregnant women and immunosuppressed
persons.
Most vaccines, including live vaccines (MMR, varicella, zoster,
rotavirus, LAIV, and yellow fever) can be administered to
infants or children who are household contacts of pregnant
or immunosuppressed persons, as well as to breastfeeding
infants (where applicable). Vaccinia (smallpox) vaccine
should not be administered to household contacts of a
pregnant or immunosuppressed person in a nonemergency
situation. Live attenuated influenza vaccine should not be
administered to persons who have contact with severely
immunosuppressed persons who are hospitalized and
require care in a protected environment (i.e., who are in
isolation because of immunosuppression). LAIV may be
administered to contacts of persons with lesser degrees of
immunosuppression.
Measles and mumps vaccine viruses produce a noncom-
municable infection and are not transmitted to household
contacts. Rubella vaccine virus has been shown to be shed in
human milk, but transmission to an infant has rarely been
documented. Transmission of varicella vaccine virus is not
24


## p. 25 (#39) ##############################################

General Recommendations on Immunization
common, and most women and older immunosuppressed
persons are immune from having had chickenpox as a child.
Transmission of zoster vaccine virus to household or other
close contacts has not been reported.
2
Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding does not decrease the response to routine
childhood vaccines and is not a contraindication for any
vaccine except smallpox. Yellow fever vaccine should be
avoided in breastfeeding women. However, when nursing
mothers cannot avoid or postpone travel to areas endemic
for yellow fever in which risk for acquisition is high, these
women should be vaccinated. Breastfeeding also does
not extend or improve the passive immunity to vaccine-
preventable disease that is provided by maternal antibody
except possibly for Haemophilus influenzae type b. Breastfed
infants should be vaccinated according to recommended
schedules. Although rubella vaccine virus might be shed
in human milk, infection of an infant is rare. LAIV may be
administered to a woman who is breastfeeding if she is
otherwise eligible; the risk of transmission of vaccine virus is
unknown but is probably low.
Preterm Birth
Vaccines should be started on schedule on the basis of the
child's chronological age. Preterm infants have been shown
to respond adequately to vaccines used in infancy.
Studies demonstrate that decreased seroconversion rates
might occur among preterm infants with very low birth
weight (less than 2,000 grams) after administration of hepa-
titis B vaccine at birth. However, by 1 month chronological
age, all preterm infants, regardless of initial birth weight
or gestational age are as likely to respond as adequately
as older and larger infants. All preterm infants born to
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive mothers and
mothers with unknown HBsAg status must receive immuno-
prophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours after
birth. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) also must be given
to these infants. If the maternal HBsAg status is unknown,
and the infant weighs 2,000 grams or more, HBIG must be
given within 7 days of birth. If the maternal HBsAg status
is positive or the infant weighs less than 2,000 grams, HBIG
must be given within 12 hours of birth. Note that if the
infant weighs less than 2,000 grams, the initial hepatitis B
vaccine dose should not be counted toward completion of
the hepatitis B vaccine series, and three additional doses of
hepatitis B vaccine should be administered beginning when
the infant is 1 month of age.
Preterm infants with a birth weight of less than 2,000 grams
who are born to women documented to be HBsAg-negative

at the time of birth should receive the first dose of the
hepatitis B vaccine series at 1 month of chronological age or
at the time of hospital discharge.
Allergy to Products Not Present in Vaccine
Infants and children with nonspecific allergies, duck or
feather allergy, or allergy to penicillin, children who have
relatives with allergies, and children taking allergy shots
can and should be immunized. No vaccine available in the
United States contains duck antigen or penicillin.
Allergy That is Not Anaphylactic
Anaphylactic allergy to a vaccine component (such as egg
or neomycin) is a true contraindication to vaccination. If an
allergy to a vaccine component is not anaphylactic or is not
severe, it is not a contraindication to that vaccine.
Family History of Adverse Events
A family history of seizures is a precaution for the use of
MMRV vaccine. Immunosuppression may affect the decision
for varicella vaccine. A family history of adverse reactions
unrelated to immunosuppression or family history of
seizures or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is not a
contraindication to vaccination. Varicella-containing vaccine
(except zoster) should not be administered to persons who
have a family history of congenital or hereditary immuno-
deficiency in first-degree relatives (e.g., parents and siblings)
unless the immunocompetence of the potential vaccine
recipient has been clinically substantiated or verified by a
laboratory.
Tuberculin Skin Test
Infants and children who need a tuberculin skin test (TST)
can and should be immunized. All vaccines, including MMR,
can be given on the same day as a TST, or any time after a
TST is applied. For most vaccines, there are no TST timing
restrictions.
MMR vaccine may decrease the response to a TST, poten-
tially causing a false-negative response in someone who
actually has an infection with tuberculosis. MMR can be
given the same day as a TST, but if MMR has been given
and 1 or more days have elapsed, in most situations a
wait of at least 4 weeks is recommended before giving
a routine TST. No information on the effect of varicella-
containing vaccine or LAIV on a TST is available. Until such
information is available, it is prudent to apply rules for
spacing measles vaccine and TST to varicella vaccine and
LAIV.
26


## p. 27 (#41) ##############################################

General Recommendations on Immunization
21
There is a new type of tuberculosis test known as an
interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Even though this test
improves upon the TST because it is less affected by previous
doses of BCG vaccine and less affected by previous doses of
tuberculosis diagnostic testing, it still may be affected by
previous doses of other live vaccines so it is prudent to apply
the same spacing rules as for TST.
Multiple Vaccines
As noted earlier in this chapter, administration at the same
visit of all vaccines for which a person is eligible is critical
to reaching and maintaining high vaccination coverage. All
vaccines (except vaccinia) can be administered at the same
visit as all other vaccines.
Screening for Contraindications and
Precautions to Vaccination
The key to preventing serious adverse reactions is screening.
Every person who administers vaccines should screen every
patient for contraindications and precautions before giving
the vaccine dose. Effective screening is not difficult or
complicated and can be accomplished with just a few ques-
tions.
Screening Questions
• Is the child (or are you) sick today?
• Does the child have allergies to
medications, food, or any vaccine?
• Has the child had a serious reaction to a
vaccine in the past?
• Has the child had a seizure, or brain or
nerve problem?
• Has the child had a health problem with
asthma, lung disease, heart disease, kidney
disease, metabolic disease such as diabetes,
or a blood disorder?
• Does the child have cancer, leukemia,
AIDS, or any other immune system
problem?
Is the child (or are you) sick today?
There is no evidence that acute illness reduces vaccine
efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events. However, as
a precaution, with moderate or severe acute illness, all
vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved.
Mild illnesses (such as otitis media, upper respiratory
infections, and diarrhea) are NOT contraindications to vacci-
nation. Do not withhold vaccination if a person is taking
antibiotics.
Screening Questions
• Has the child taken cortisone, prednisone,
other steroids, or anticancer drugs, or had
X-ray treatments in the past 3 months?
• Has the child received a transfusion of blood
or blood products, or been given a medicine
called immune (gamma) globulin in the past
year?
• Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a
chance she could become pregnant during
the next month?
• Has the child received vaccinations in the
past 4 weeks?
Does the child have allergies to medications, food,
or any vaccine?
A history of anaphylactic reaction such as hives (urticaria),
wheezing or difficulty breathing, or circulatory collapse
or shock (not fainting) from a previous dose of vaccine or
vaccine component is a contraindication for further doses.
For example, if a person experiences anaphylaxis after eating
eggs, do not administer influenza vaccine. It may be more
efficient to inquire about allergies in a generic way (i.e., any
food or medication) rather than to inquire about specific
vaccine components. Most parents will not be familiar with
minor components of vaccine, but they should know if the
child has had an allergic reaction to a food or medication
that was severe enough to require medical attention.
27


## p. 28 (#42) ##############################################

General Recommendations on Immunization
Has the child had a serious reaction to a vaccine in
the past?
A history of anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of
vaccine or vaccine component is a contraindication for
subsequent doses. A history of encephalopathy within 7 days
following DTP/DTP is a contraindication for further doses of
pertussis-containing vaccine. Precautions to DTP (not Tdap)
include (a) seizure within 3 days of a dose, (b) pale or limp
episode or collapse within 48 hours of a dose, (c) continuous
crying for 3 hours within 48 hours of a dose, and (d) fever of
105°F (40°C) or higher within 48 hours of a previous dose.
There are other adverse events that might have occurred
following vaccination that constitute contraindications or
precautions to future doses. Usually vaccines are deferred
when a precaution is present. However, situations may arise
when the benefit outweighs the risk (e.g., during a community
pertussis outbreak). A local reaction (redness or swelling at
the site of injection) is not a contraindication to subsequent
doses.
Has the child had a seizure, or brain or nerve
problem?
DTP and Tdap are contraindicated for children who have a
history of encephalopathy within 7 days following DTP/DTap.
An unstable progressive neurologic problem is a precaution
to the use of DTP and Tdap. Children with stable neurologic
disorders (including seizures) unrelated to vaccination may
be vaccinated as usual.
A history of Guillain-Barré syndrome is a precaution for
tetanus-containing and influenza vaccines.
Has the child had a health problem with asthma,
lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease,
metabolic disease such as diabetes, or a blood
disorder?
Children with any of these conditions should not receive
LAIV. Children with these conditions should receive inacti-
vated influenza vaccine only.
Does the child have cancer, leukemia, AIDS, or any
other immune system problem?
Live-virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella, rotavirus, and the
intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV]) are
usually contraindicated in immunocompromised children.
However, there are exceptions. For example, MMR and
varicella vaccines are recommended for asymptomatic
HIV-infected children who do not have evidence of severe
immunosuppression. Persons with severe immunosuppres-
sion should not receive MMR, varicella, rotavirus, or LAIV
vaccines. For details, consult the ACIP recommendations for
each vaccine.

Has the child taken cortisone, prednisone, other
steroids, or anticancer drugs, or had x-ray treat-
ments in the past 3 months?
Live-virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella, zoster, LAIV) should
be postponed until after chemotherapy or long-term,
high-dose steroid therapy has ended. Details and the length
of time to postpone vaccination are described elsewhere
in this chapter and in the General Recommendations on
Immunization.
Has the child received a transfusion of blood or
blood products, or been given a medicine called
immune (gamma) globulin in the past year?
Certain live virus vaccines (e.g., MMR and varicella)
may need to be deferred, depending on the type of blood
product and the interval since the blood product was admin-
istered. Information on recommended intervals between
immune globulin or blood product administration and MMR
or varicella vaccination is in Appendix A and in the General
Recommendations on Immunization.
Is the child/teen pregnant or is there a chance she
could become pregnant during the next month?
Live-virus vaccines (e.g., MMR, varicella, zoster, LAIV) are
contraindicated during pregnancy because of the theoretical
risk of virus transmission to the fetus. Sexually active young
women who receive MMR or varicella vaccination should
be instructed to practice careful contraception for 1 month
following receipt of either vaccine. On theoretical grounds,
inactivated poliovirus vaccine should not be given during
pregnancy; however, it may be given if the risk of exposure
is imminent (e.g., travel to endemic-disease areas) and
immediate protection is needed. Use of Td or Tdap is not
contraindicated in pregnancy. At the provider's discretion,
either vaccine may be administered during the second or
third trimester.
Has the child received vaccinations in the past
4 weeks?
If the child was given either live attenuated influenza
vaccine or an injectable live-virus vaccine (e.g., MMR. vari-
cella, yellow fever) in the past 4 weeks, he or she should wait
28 days before receiving another live vaccine. Inactivated
vaccines may be given at the same time or at any time
before or after a live vaccine.
Every person should be screened for contraindications and
precautions before vaccination. Standardized screening
forms for both children and adults have been developed by
the Immunization Action Coalition and are available on their
web site at http://www.immunize.org.

Immunization Strategies for
Healthcare Practices and
Providers
The Need for Strategies to Increase
Immunization Levels
An important component of an immunization provider
practice is ensuring that the vaccines reach all children who
need them. While attention to appropriate administration
of vaccinations is essential, it cannot be assumed that these
vaccinations are being given to every eligible child at the
recommended age. Immunization levels in the Unites States
are high, but gaps still exist, and providers can do much to
maintain or increase immunization rates among patients in
their practice. This chapter describes the need for increasing
immunization levels and outlines strategies that providers
can adopt to increase coverage in their own practice.
Vaccine-preventable disease rates in the United States are at
very low levels. In 2009, only 71 cases of measles, 3 cases of
rubella, no cases of diphtheria, 18 cases of tetanus, and no
wild-type polio were reported to CDC. Given these immuni-
zation successes, one might question the continued interest
in strategies to increase immunization levels.
However, although levels of vaccine-preventable diseases are
low, this should not lead to complacency regarding vaccina-
tion. For several reasons—including possible resurgence of
disease, introduction of new vaccines, suboptimal immu-
nization levels, cost-effectiveness, and gaps in sustainable
immunization efforts the need to focus on immunization
rates remains crucial. The viruses and bacteria that cause
vaccine-preventable disease and death still exist and can
be passed on to unprotected persons or imported from
other countries as demonstrated by measles outbreaks
that occurred in 2008. Diseases such as measles, mumps,
or pertussis can be more severe than often assumed and
can result in social and economic as well as physical costs:
sick children miss school, parents lose time from work, and
illness among healthcare providers can severely disrupt
a healthcare system. For many of these diseases, without
vaccination, the incidence will rise to prevaccine levels.
Although levels of disease are the ultimate outcome of
interest, these are a late indicator of the soundness of the
immunization system. Immunization levels are a better
indicator for determining if there is a problem with immu-
nization delivery, and this chapter will focus on increasing
immunization levels and the strategies healthcare providers
can use to do this.
31


## p. 32 (#46) ##############################################

Immunization Strategies for Healthcare Practices and Providers
Specific concerns about U.S. immunization levels and areas
for further study include the following:
3
Childhood immunization rates are still suboptimal. In 2009,
for example, only 85.7% of children 19 to 35 months of age
had received four doses of DTP vaccine.
For other age groups, immunization rates are considerably
lower than those for early childhood. According to Behavior
Risk Factor Surveillance System data from 2005, a median of
only 65.5% of persons 65 years of age and older received the
influenza vaccine in the past 12 months, and 65.7% had ever
received pneumococcal vaccine.
Economic and racial disparities exist. Low-income and
minority children and adults are at greater risk for underim-
munization. “Pockets of need” exist in our nation's inner
cities.
Rates of influenza immunization are also unacceptably low
among healthcare providers, an important target population
for vaccination. Typically, fewer than 40% of healthcare
providers receive influenza vaccine.
Why Focus on Strategies to
Increase Immunization?
Improvements in adult immunization rates have tapered
off. According to data from the National Health Interview
Survey, after a consistent increase in rates during the 1980s
and early 1990s, improvements in influenza vaccination
rates for adults 65 years of age and older have leveled off
since 1997.
• Immunization levels not optimal
• Cost-effectiveness of some
strategies uncertain
• Sustainable systems needed
Cost-effectiveness needs more research. More research is
needed regarding which strategies increase immunization
levels with the least expenditure so these strategies can be
prioritized.
Sustainable systems for vaccinating children, adolescents,
and adults must be developed. High immunization rates
cannot rest upon one-time or short-term efforts. Greater
understanding of strategies to increase and sustain immuni-
zation levels is necessary in order to create lasting, effective
immunization delivery systems.
Many strategies have been used to increase immunizations.
Some, such as school entry laws, have effectively increased
demand for vaccines, but the effectiveness of other strate-
gies (e.g., advertising) is less well documented. Some proven
strategies (e.g., reducing costs, linking immunization to
Women Infants and Children (WIC) services, home visiting) are
well suited to increasing rates among specific populations,
such as persons with low access to immunization services.
One key to a successful strategy to increase immunization is
matching the proposed solution to the current problem. At
present in the United States, most persons have sufficient

interest in and access to health care and are seen, at least
periodically, in healthcare systems. Those who remain
unvaccinated are so largely because healthcare practices
and providers do not always optimally perform the activities
associated with delivering vaccines and keeping patients
up-to-date with their immunization schedules. Although a
combination of strategies—directed at both providers and
the public—is necessary for increasing and maintaining high
immunization rates, this chapter focuses on immunization
strategies for healthcare practices and providers.
AFIX
Assessment
Feedback
Incentives
eXchange
The AFIX Approach
The CDC, through state and other grantees, administers
a program designed to move healthcare personnel
from a state of unawareness about the problem of low
immunization rates in their practice to one in which
they are knowledgeable, concerned, motivated to change
their immunization practices and capable of sustaining new
behaviors. The acronym used for this approach is AFIX:
Assessment of the immunization coverage of public and
private providers, Feedback of diagnostic information to
improve service delivery, Incentives to motivate providers to
change immunization practices or recognition of improved
or high performance, and exchange of information among
providers. First conceived by the Georgia Division of Public
Health, AFIX is now being used nationwide with both public
and private immunization providers and is recommended by
governmental and nongovernmental vaccine programs and
medical professional societies.
Overview
The AFIX process consists of an assessment of an immunization
provider's coverage rates by a trained representative from
the state or other immunization grantee program, feedback
of the results of the assessment to provider staff, incentives
to improve deficiencies and raise immunization rates,
and exchange of information and ideas among healthcare
providers. Some specific characteristics of this approach
have made it one of the most effective for achieving high,
sustainable vaccine coverage.
Special Characteristics of AFIX
First, AFIX focuses on outcomes. It starts with an assessment,
producing an estimate of immunization coverage levels in
a provider's office, and these data help to identify specific
actions to take in order to remedy deficiencies. Outcomes
are easily measurable. Second, AFIX focuses on providers,
those who are key to increasing immunization rates. AFIX
requires no governmental policy changes, nor does it
attempt to persuade clients to be vaccinated, but instead
focuses on changing healthcare provider behavior. Third,
AFIX, when used successfully, is a unique blend of advanced
technology and personal interaction. Much of the AFIX

and personal interaction
33

process can be done electronically, increasing speed and
accuracy of assessment and feedback and streamlining
reporting. However, the personal skills of the assessor and
that person's ability to establish rapport with and motivate a
provider are critical to achieving lasting results.
Assessment
.
• Evaluation of medical records to
ascertain the immunization rate
for a defined group
Diagnosis of potential service
delivery problems
• Assessment increases
awareness
Assessment
Assessment refers to the evaluation of medical records
to ascertain the immunization rate for a defined group
of patients as well as to provide targeted diagnosis for
improvement. This step is essential because several studies
have documented that most healthcare providers, while
supportive of immunizations, do not have an accurate
perception of their own practice's immunization rates.
Pediatricians in these studies greatly overestimated the
proportion of fully immunized children in their practices.
Assessment increases awareness of a provider's actual situa-
tion and provides a basis for subsequent actions by provider
staff.
CDC has developed a software program, COCASA, that
enables assessment to be done electronically, is flexible
enough to accommodate whatever assessment parameters
are desired, and provides results that can be printed
immediately. This program will be described further in the
section, “AFIX Tools and Training."
Feedback
Feedback
Feedback is the process of informing immunization
providers about their performance in delivering one or more
vaccines to a defined client population. The work of assess-
ment is of no use unless the results are fed back to persons
who can make a change. Assessment together with feedback
creates the awareness necessary for behavior change.
• Informing immunization
providers about their
performance
• Assessment with feedback
creates the awareness
necessary for behavior change
How to Provide Feedback
. With feeling and precision
• Without judgment
• With confidentiality as appropriate
Feedback generally consists of the immunization program
representative meeting with appropriate provider staff
and discussing the results of the assessment in order to
determine the next steps to be taken. This may be done at
a second visit following the assessment of the provider's
records, or it may take place the same day. There are
advantages and disadvantages to each approach. If COCASA
has been used, the summary report that is generated can
identify specific subsets of patients (e.g., those who have not
completed the series because of a missed opportunity for
immunization) that, if found in substantial numbers, can
provide clues to which changes in the provider's practice
would be most effective. This can save time and make the
feedback session more focused.
The personal element of feedback, as mentioned, is also
critical to its success. A reviewer who is involved and
34


## p. 35 (#49) ##############################################

Immunization Strategies for Healthcare Practices and Providers
committed to the AFIX process, who addresses deficiencies
without judgment, and who respects the confidentiality
of the data and the efforts of the provider will be likely to
gain the trust of providers and motivate them to increase
immunization rates in the practice.
31
Incentives
.
Incentives
An incentive is defined as something that incites one to
action or effort. Incentives are built into the AFIX process,
recognizing that immunization providers, like everyone else,
will accomplish a desired task more successfully if motivated
to do so. The assessment and feedback components are
not intended to be done in isolation; providers may have
sufficient data about their practice's immunization rates,
but they must recognize high immunization coverage as a
desirable goal and be motivated to achieve it.
Something that incites to action
Vary by provider and stage of
progress
• Opportunities for partnership
and collaboration
Incentives are extremely variable. No one thing will be
effective for every provider, and a single provider may need
different types of motivation at different stages of progress.
Things like small tokens of appreciation and providing
resource materials at meetings have helped providers
approach their task positively and create an atmosphere
of teamwork, but longer-term goals must be considered
as well. Since the effort to raise immunization rates may
involve an increase in duties for staff, offering assistance
in reviewing records or sending reminder notices might
more directly address a provider's needs. Incentives pose a
challenge to the creativity of the program representative but
also offer the opportunity to try new ideas.
Finally, incentives are opportunities for partnerships and
collaboration. Professional organizations or businesses have
been solicited to publicize the immunization efforts in a
newsletter or provide funding for other rewards for provider
staff. Many other types of collaboration are possible; these
also have the benefit of increasing awareness of immuniza-
tion among diverse groups.
eXchange of Information
eXchange of Information
The final AFIX component, exchange of information, goes
hand in hand with incentives. The more information
providers have about their own practice's immunization
coverage status, how it compares with state norms and
with other providers in their community, and what strate-
gies have been successful with other providers, the more
knowledgeable and motivated they will be to increase their
immunization rates. It is up to the AFIX representative to
provide appropriate statistical and educational information
and create forums for exchange of information among
providers.
• Allows access to more
experience than an individual
can accumulate
• Motivates improvement
• Coordinates resources
and efforts
35


## p. 36 (#50) ##############################################

Immunization Strategies for Healthcare Practices and Providers
Staff members at all levels can benefit from the exchange
of ideas about immunization practices and increasing rates
of coverage—what has worked or not worked with another
provider, streamlining office procedures, or where to
obtain educational or other resources. The forums for such
exchanges vary widely from informal meetings on the local
level to more structured meetings sponsored by govern-
ment or professional organizations. Immunization training
sessions can be combined with sharing of ideas regarding
actual situations in which recommendations, such as those
from ACIP, are applied.
With the increased use of electronic communication,
this method should not be neglected in the information
exchange component of AFIX. Although different from face-
to-face communication, e-mail exchanges or newsletters
sent electronically can be cost-saving and fast means of
disseminating information.
VFCIAFIX
• Incorporate AFIX activities
during VFC site visits
• Combine VFCIAFIX site visits
• Reduces number of visits
• Extends reach of AFIX
VFC-AFIX Initiative
In the last several years, responsibility for immunization
has largely shifted from public health departments to
private providers, who now vaccinate nearly 80% of children
in the United States. Many of these providers participate
in the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program, a federal
program whereby funding is provided for state and other
immunization programs to purchase vaccines and make
them available at no cost to children who meet income
eligibility requirements. Because immunization program
staff make periodic quality assurance site visits to VFC
providers, CDC launched an initiative in 2000 to link some
AFIX and VFC activities and incorporate AFIX activities during
VEC provider site visits. VFC program staff are encouraged
to promote the AFIX approach and, if possible, to combine
VFC and AFIX site visits. This reduces the number of visits to
a single provider and helps avoid duplication of staff time
and effort. In addition, it increases the emphasis on overall
quality improvement for a provider rather than meeting the
requirements of a single program.
VFC serves more than 30,000 private provider sites, and
every state participates in the program. VFC provider
site visits are conducted to review compliance with VFC
eligibility screening requirements and to evaluate vaccine
storage and handling procedures. Linking VFC with AFIX
enables AFIX to reach a large number of providers in the
private sector and to reinforce the goals of both programs.

AFIX Tools And Training
The CDC has developed a software program titled
Comprehensive Clinic Assessment Software Application
(COCASA) to enable electronic entry of AFIX and VFC site visit
data. COCASA, first released in December 2005, is an update
of previous versions of CASA and supersedes previous
versions. Using COCASA, a reviewer enters appropriate basic
information about an individual provider and conducts an
assessment of patient records. The user also has the option
to record AFIX visit outcomes and VFC site visit information.
Comprehensive Clinic
Assessment Software
Application (COCASA)
• VFC and AFIX results
• Immediate assessment results
• Estimate of coverage levels
• Reasons for deficiencies
• Reports on patient subsets
COCASA can provide immediate results of the assessment,
supplying the reviewer with the information needed for use
in the feedback session and noting areas that need further
follow-up. COCASA saves the reviewer time and provides
various analysis options. COCASA reports provide estimates
of immunization coverage levels and potential reasons
for the coverage level, such as missed opportunities for
immunization and patients who did not return to finish the
immunization series. The program can generate reports on
specific sets of patients, such as those mentioned. Data from
an immunization registry or patient management system
can be imported into COCASA, and data collected during the
visit can be exported for further analysis.
COCASA is available on the CDC Vaccines and Immunization
website at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/cocasa/
default.htm. Comprehensive training modules on AFIX and
on how to use COCASA are built into the COCASA program.
Additional information about AFIX is available on the CDC
Vaccines and Immunization website at http://www.cdc.gov/
vaccines/programs/afix/default.htm.
AFIX Endorsements
AFIX is widely supported as an effective strategy to improve
vaccination rates. Many states have shown gradual and
consistent improvement in their coverage levels in the
public sector, and studies of private pediatricians have
also documented substantial improvements in median
up-to-date coverage at 24 months. Assessment and feedback
of public and private provider sites are recommended by
the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) in the
Standards of Pediatric Immunization Practices as well as by
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in
a statement endorsing the AFIX process and recommending
its use by all public and private providers. Healthy People
2010 also supports the AFIX concept with a recommendation
for increasing the proportion of immunization providers
who have measured vaccination levels among children in
their practice within the past 2 years.
37

One of the Standards for Adult Immunization Practices
issued by NVAC calls upon providers of adult immuniza-
tion to do annual assessments of coverage levels. Although
the use of AFIX among providers who serve adults is not as
widespread as among childhood immunization providers,
this strategy can be a powerful tool to improve rates in the
adult population.
Strategies for High
Immunization Levels
• Recordkeeping
• Recommendations and
reinforcement
• Reminder and recall to patients
• Reminder and recall to providers
• Reduction of missed opportunities
• Reduction of barriers to
immunization
Other Essential Strategies
Although a substantial portion of this chapter is devoted to
AFIX, certain other strategies for improvement of immuni-
zation levels deserve emphasis. These are complementary
to AFIX; their adoption will support the goals of AFIX, i.e.,
raising immunization coverage levels, and will facilitate
the AFIX process and ensure a favorable outcome of an
assessment.
Records
• Must be available at the time
of the visit
Recordkeeping
Patient records are of vital importance in a medical
practice, and maintaining these records, whether paper
or electronic, is critical to providing optimal healthcare.
Immunization records, specifically, should meet all
applicable legal requirements as well as requirements of
any specific program, such as VFC, in which the provider
participates. These records should be available for inspec-
tion by an AFIX or VFC representative and should be easy
to interpret by anyone examining the record.
• Must be easy to read
Must be accurate
-reflect current patient
population
-reflect all vaccines given
Immunization records must be accurate. The active
medical records must reflect which patients are actually
in the practice; charts of persons who have moved or are
obtaining services elsewhere should be clearly marked
accordingly or removed. Records should be kept up-to-
date as new immunizations are administered, and all
information regarding the vaccine and its administration
should be complete.
Because patients often receive vaccines at more than one
provider office, communication between sites is necessary
for maintaining complete and accurate immunization
records. School-based, public health, and community-
based immunization sites should communicate with
primary care personnel through quick and reliable
methods such as immunization information systems,
telephone, fax, or e-mail. This will become increasingly
important as new vaccines for adolescents are added to
the immunization schedule and more alternative sites are
available for receiving immunizations.

Immunization Information Systems
3)
Immunization Information Systems CIISI
Many recordkeeping tasks, as well as patient reminder/
recall activities, can be greatly simplified by participation
in a population-based immunization information system
(IIS), also known as an immunization registry. An IIS is a
computerized information system that contains information
about the immunization status of each child in a given
geographic area (e.g., a state). In some areas, an IIS is linked
to a child's complete medical record. An IIS provides a single
data source for all community immunization providers,
enabling access to records of children receiving vaccinations
at multiple providers. It provides a reliable immunization
history for every enrolled child and can also produce
accurate immunization records, if needed for school or
summer camp entry.
• Single data source for all
providers
• Reliable immunization history
• Produce records for patient use
• Key to increasing immunization
levels
The Task Force on Community Preventive Services recom-
mends immunization information systems on the basis of
strong evidence of effectiveness in increasing vaccination
rates. Specifically, the Task Force concluded that IIS are
directly related to increasing vaccination rates through their
capabilities to create or support effective interventions such
as client reminder/recall systems, provider assessment and
feedback, and provider reminders; generate and evaluate
public health responses to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable
disease; facilitate vaccine management and accountability;
determine client vaccination status for decisions made
by clinicians, health departments, and schools; and aid
surveillance and investigations on vaccination rates, missed
vaccination opportunities, invalid dose administration, and
disparities in vaccination coverage.
A goal of Healthy People 2020 is to increase to 95% the
proportion of children younger than 6 years of age who
participate in fully operational, population-based immuniza-
tion registries. In 2009, approximately 77% of children in
this age-group met this participation goal. Federal, state
and local public health agencies are continuing their
efforts to improve the registries themselves and to increase
participation by immunization providers. Registries are
a key to increasing and maintaining immunization levels
and provide benefits for providers, patients, and state and
federal immunization program personnel. More informa-
tion about immunization registries is available on the CDC
Vaccines and Immunization website at http://www.cdc.gov
vaccines/programs/iis/default.htm.

Recommendations to Parents and
Reinforcement of the Need to Return
The recommendation of a healthcare provider is a powerful
motivator for patients to comply with vaccination recom-
mendations. Parents of pediatric patients are likely to follow
vaccine recommendation of the child's doctor, and even
39


## p. 40 (#54) ##############################################

Immunization Strategies for Healthcare Practices and Providers
adults who were initially reluctant were likely to receive an
influenza vaccination when the healthcare provider's opinion
of the vaccine was positive.
3
Regardless of their child's true immunization status, many
parents believe the child is fully vaccinated. Parents may
not have been told or may not have understood that return
visits are necessary. It is useful for patients to have the
next appointment date in hand at the time they leave the
provider's office. An additional reminder strategy is to link
the timing of the return visit to some calendar event, e.g.,
the child's birthday or an upcoming holiday. Even with
written schedules or reminders, a verbal encouragement
and reminder can be an incentive for a patient's completing
the immunization series and can ultimately result in higher
coverage levels.
Reminder and Recall to Patients
• Reminder-notification that
immunizations are due soon
• Recall
notification that
immunizations are past due
• Content of message and
technique of delivery vary
• Reminders and recall have been
found to be effective
Reminder and Recall Messages to Patients
Patient reminders and recall messages are messages
to patients or their parents stating that recommended
immunizations are due soon (reminders) or past due (recall
messages). The messages vary in their level of personaliza-
tion and specificity, the mode of communication, (e.g.,
postcard, letter, telephone), and the degree of automation.
Both reminders and recall messages have been found to be
effective in increasing attendance at clinics and improving
vaccination rates in various settings.
Cost is sometimes thought to be a barrier to the implemen-
tation of a reminder/recall system. However, a range of
options is available, from computer-generated telephone
calls and letters to a card file box with weekly dividers,
and these can be adapted to the needs of the provider.
The specific type of system is not directly related to its
effectiveness, and the benefits of having any system can
extend beyond immunizations to other preventive services
and increase the use of other recommended screenings.
Both the Standards for Child and Adolescent Immunization
Practices and the Standards for Adult Immunization Practices
call upon providers to develop and implement aggressive
tracking systems that will both remind parents of upcoming
immunizations and recall children who are overdue. ACIP
supports the use of reminder/recall systems by all providers.
The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory
Diseases provides state and local health departments with
ongoing technical support to assist them in implementing
reminder and recall systems in public and private provider
sites.
Reminder and Recall Messages to Providers
Providers can create reminder and recall systems for
40


## p. 41 (#55) ##############################################

Immunization Strategies for Healthcare Practices and Providers
Reminder and Recall to Providers
themselves as aids for remembering for which patients
routine immunizations are due soon or past due. Provider
reminder/recall is different from "feedback," in which the
provider receives a message about overall immunization
levels for a group of clients. Examples of reminder/recall
messages are
31
• Communication to healthcare
providers that an individual
client's immunizations are due
soon or past due
• Examples
-computer-generated list
stamped note in the chart
-"Immunization Due" clip on chart
A computer-generated list that notifies a provider of the
children to be seen that clinic session whose vaccinations
are past due.
A stamp with a message such as “No Pneumococcal
Vaccine on Record,” that a receptionist or nurse can put
on a the chart of a person age 65 years or older.
An “Immunization Due” clip that a nurse attaches to
the chart of an adolescent who has not had hepatitis B
vaccine.
Reminder systems will vary according to the needs of the
provider; in addition to raising immunization rates in the
practice, they will serve to heighten the awareness of staff
members of the continual need to check the immunization
status of their patients.
Missed Opportunity
Reduction of Missed Opportunities to Vaccinate
A missed opportunity is a healthcare encounter in which a
person is eligible to receive a vaccination but is not vacci-
nated completely. Missed opportunities occur in all settings
in which immunizations are offered, whether routinely or not.
A healthcare encounter in which
a person is eligible to receive
vaccination but is not vaccinated
completely
Missed opportunities occur for several reasons. At the
provider level, many nurses and physicians avoid simul-
taneous administration of four or even three injectable
vaccines. Frequently stated reasons have included concern
about reduced immune response or adverse events, and
parental objection. These concerns are not supported by
scientific data. Providers also may be unaware that a child
is in need of vaccination (especially if the immunization
record is not available at the visit) or may follow invalid
contraindications (see Chapter 2 for more information).
Reasons for Missed
Opportunities
• Lack of simultaneous
administration
• Unaware child needs additional
vaccines
• Invalid contraindications
• Inappropriate clinic policies
• Reimbursement deficiencies
Some of the reasons for missed opportunities relate to larger
systems; e.g., a clinic that has a policy of not vaccinating at
any visits except well-child care, or not vaccinating siblings.
Other reasons relate to large institutional or bureaucratic
regulations, such as state insurance laws that deny reim-
bursement if a vaccine is given during an acute-care visit.
The degree of difficulty in eliminating the missed opportu-
nity may vary directly with the size of the system that has to
be changed.
41


## p. 42 (#56) ##############################################

Immunization Strategies for Healthcare Practices and Providers
Several studies have shown that eliminating missed oppor-
tunities could increase vaccination coverage by up to 20
percent. Strategies designed to prevent missed opportunities
have taken many different forms, used alone or in combina-
tion. Examples include the following:
3
Strategies for Reducing
Missed Opportunities
• Standing orders
• Provider education with
feedback
• Provider reminder and recall
systems
Standing orders. These are protocols whereby nonphysi-
cian immunization personnel may vaccinate clients
without direct physician involvement at the time of
the immunization. Standing orders are implemented in
settings such as clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes.
When used alone or in combination with other interven-
tions, standing orders have had positive effects on
immunization rates among adults and children.
Provider education. Anyone responsible for administering
immunizations should be knowledgeable about prin-
ciples of vaccination and vaccination scheduling, to the
extent required for their position. Providers are largely
responsible for educating their patients, so an investment
in provider education will result in a higher level of
understanding about immunizations among the public
in general. Numerous educational materials, in a variety
of formats, are available from CDC, the Immunization
Action Coalition, and some state health departments,
hospitals, or professional organizations. Incorporating
some AFIX principles (i.e., assessment, feedback) into a
provider education program might have a greater effect
on provider behavior than an education effort aimed only
at increasing knowledge.
Provider reminder and recall systems. Provider reminder
and recall systems are discussed above. These reminder
systems, while effective in increasing immunization levels,
can also help avoid missed opportunities if they are a
component of other practices directed toward this goal.
For example, if a reminder system is used consistently
and staff members are knowledgeable about vaccination
opportunities and valid contraindications, the system can
be an additional aid in promoting appropriate immuniza-
tion practices.
.
Reduction to Barriers

--distance
• Psychological barriers

Reduction of Barriers to Immunization Within
the Practice
Despite efforts by providers to adhere to appropriate immu-
nization practices, obstacles to patients' being vaccinated
may exist within the practice setting, sometimes unknown
to the provider. Barriers to immunization maybe physical
or psychological. Physical barriers might be such things as
inconvenient clinic hours for working patients or parents,
long waits at the clinic, or the distance patients must travel.
Providers should be encouraged to determine the needs
of their specific patient population and take steps, such
42

as extending clinic hours or providing some immunization
clinics, to address obstacles to immunization.
31
Cost is also a barrier to immunization for many patients.
In addition to evaluating their fee schedule for possible
adjustments, providers should be knowledgeable about such
programs as Vaccines for Children and the State Children's
Health Insurance Program and the provisions specific to
their state. Enrollment as a VFC provider is recommended
for those with eligible children in their practice.
Psychological barriers to health care are often more subtle
but may be just as important. Unpleasant experiences (e.g.,
fear of immunizations, being criticized for previously missed
appointments, or difficulty leaving work for a clinic appoint-
ment) may lead clients to postpone receiving needed vacci-
nations. Concerns about vaccine safety are also preventing
some parents from having their children immunized.
Overcoming such barriers calls for both knowledge and
interpersonal skills on the part of the provider—knowledge
of vaccines and updated recommendations and of reliable
sources to direct patients to find accurate information, and
skills to deal with fears and misconceptions and to provide a
supportive and encouraging environment for patients.

Vaccine Safety
4
Vaccine Safety
Vaccine safety is a prime concern for the public, manufac-
turers, immunization providers, and recipients of vaccines.
This chapter describes how vaccines licensed for use in the
United States are monitored for safety, and presents general
information about the provider's role in immunization
safety. Further information about contraindications and
precautions for individual vaccines, such as pregnancy and
immunosuppression, and about potential adverse events
associated with the vaccine is contained in the chapter on
General Recommendations on Immunization, and in the
chapters on specific vaccines.
The Insportance of Vaccine Safety
Programs
Vaccination is among the most significant public health
success stories of all time. However, like any pharmaceutical
product, no vaccine is completely safe or completely effec-
tive. While almost all known vaccine adverse events are
minor and self-limited, some vaccines have been associated
with very rare but serious health effects. The following
key considerations underscore the need for an active and
ongoing vaccine safety program.
Importance of Vaccine Safety
• Decreases in disease risks and
increased attention on vaccine risks
• Public confidence in vaccine safety is
critical
- higher standard of safety is expected of
vaccines
- vaccinees generally healthy
(vs. ill for drugs)
- lower risk tolerance = need to search for
rare reactions
- vaccination universally recommended and
mandated
Decreases in Disease Risks
Today, vaccine-preventable diseases are at or near record
lows. Many people no longer see reminders of the severity
and potential life threatening complications of these
diseases. Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases
show that even vaccinated people are at risk for disease if
there is not adequate vaccine coverage in the population.
At the same time, approximately 28,000 reports of adverse
events following vaccination in the United States are
received by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS) each year (these include both true adverse reactions
and events that occur coincidentally after vaccination) (CDC
unpublished data). As a result, parents and providers in
the United States are more likely to know someone who
has experienced an adverse event following immunization
than they are to know someone who has experienced a
vaccine-preventable disease. The success of vaccination has
led to increased public attention on potential health risks
associated with vaccines.
Public Confidence
Maintaining public confidence in immunizations is critical
for preventing a decline in vaccination rates that can result
in outbreaks of disease. While the majority of parents
believe in the benefits of immunization and have their
children vaccinated, some have concerns about the safety
of vaccines. Public concerns about the safety of whole-cell
45

Vaccine Safety

pertussis vaccine in the 1980s resulted in decreased vaccine
coverage levels and the return of epidemic disease in Japan,
Sweden, United Kingdom, and several other countries. In
the United States, similar concerns led to increases both
in the number of lawsuits against manufacturers and the
price of vaccines, and to a decrease in the number of
manufacturers willing to produce vaccines. Close monitoring
and timely assessment of suspected vaccine adverse events
can distinguish true vaccine reactions from coincidental
unrelated events and help to maintain public confidence in
immunizations.
A higher standard of safety is generally expected of vaccines
than of other medical interventions because in contrast
to most pharmaceutical products, which are administered
to ill persons for curative purposes, vaccines are generally
given to healthy persons to prevent disease. Public tolerance
of adverse reactions related to products given to healthy
persons, especially healthy infants and children, is substan-
tially lower than for reactions to products administered to
persons who are already sick. This lower tolerance of risk for
vaccines translates into a need to investigate the possible
causes of very rare adverse events following vaccinations.
Adding to public concern about vaccines is the fact that
immunization is mandated by many state and local school
entry requirements. Because of this widespread use, safety
problems with vaccines can have a potential impact on
large numbers of persons. The importance of ensuring the
safety of a relatively universal human-directed “exposure"
like immunizations is the basis for strict regulatory control
of vaccines in the United States by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).
Importance of Vaccine Safety
• Ongoing safety monitoring needed
for the development of sound
policies and recommendations
Sound Immunization Recommendations
and Policy
Public health recommendations for vaccine programs
and practices represent a dynamic balancing of risks
and benefits. Vaccine safety monitoring is necessary to
accurately weigh this balance and adjust vaccination policy.
This was done in the United States with smallpox and oral
polio vaccines as these diseases neared global eradication.
Complications associated with each vaccine exceeded the
risks of the diseases, leading to discontinuation of routine
smallpox vaccinations in the United States (prior to actual
global eradication) and a shift to a safer inactivated polio
vaccine. Sound immunization policies and recommendations
affecting the health of the nation depend upon the ongoing
monitoring of vaccines and continuous assessment of immu-
nization benefits and risks.

Vaccine Safety
Methods of Monitoring Vaccine Safety
Prelicensure Vaccine
Safety Studies
• Laboratory
• Animals
• Humans
Prelicensure
Vaccines, like other pharmaceutical products, undergo
extensive safety and efficacy evaluations in the laboratory,
in animals, and in sequentially phased human clinical
trials prior to licensure. Phase I human clinical trials
usually involve anywhere from 20 to 100 volunteers and
focus on detecting serious side effects. Phase II trials
generally enroll hundreds of volunteers. These trials
might take a few months, or last up to 3 years. Phase II
trials determine the best dose for effectiveness and safety
and the right number of doses. Next, the vaccine moves
into Phase III trials, which may last several years. A few
hundred to several thousand volunteers may be involved.
Some volunteers receive another already-licensed vaccine,
allowing researchers to compare one vaccine with another
for adverse health effects—anything from a sore arm
to a serious reaction. If the vaccine is shown to be safe
and effective in Phase III, the manufacturer applies for a
license from the FDA. The FDA licenses the vaccine itself
(the “product license") and licenses the manufacturing
plant where the vaccine will be made (the “establishment
license"). During the application, the FDA reviews every-
thing: the clinical trial results, product labeling, the manu-
facturing plant itself, and the manufacturing protocols.
Prelicensure Human Studies
• Phases I, II, III trials
• Common reactions are identified
• Vaccines are tested in thousands
of persons before being licensed
and allowed on the market
FDA licensure occurs only after the vaccine has met
rigorous standards of efficacy and safety, and when its
potential benefits in preventing disease clearly outweigh
any risks. However, while rates of common vaccine
reactions, such as injection-site reactions and fever, can
be estimated before licensure, the comparatively small
number of patients enrolled in these trials generally
limits detection of rare side effects or side effects that
may occur many months after the vaccine is given. Even
the largest prelicensure trials (more than 10,000 persons)
are inadequate to assess the vaccine's potential to induce
possible rare side effects. Therefore, it is essential to
monitor reports of vaccine-associated adverse events once
the vaccine has been licensed and released for public use.
Fundamental to preventing safety problems is the assur-
ance that any vaccines for public use are made using Good
Manufacturing Practices and undergo lot testing for purity
and potency. Manufacturers must submit samples of each
vaccine lot and results of their own tests for potency and
purity to the FDA before releasing them for public use.
47


## p. 48 (#62) ##############################################

Vaccine Safety
Postlicensure Surveillance
Postlicensure
Because rare reactions, delayed reactions, or reactions
within subpopulations may not be detected before vaccines
are licensed, postlicensure evaluation of vaccine safety is
critical. The objectives of postlicensure surveillance are to:
4
• Identify rare reactions
• Monitor increases in known
reactions
• Identify risk factors for reactions
• Identify vaccine lots with unusual
rates or types of events
Identify signals
identify rare reactions not detected during prelicensure
studies;
monitor increases in known reactions;
identify risk factors or preexisting conditions that may
promote reactions;
identify whether there are particular vaccine lots with
unusually high rates or certain types of events; and
identify signals of possible adverse reactions that may
warrant further study or affect current immunization
recommendations.
Postlicensure Vaccine
Safety Activities
• Phase IV Trials
-~10,000 participants
-better but still limited
Large-Linked Databases
• Clinical Immunization Safety
Assessment Network
.
Historically, postlicensure monitoring of vaccine safety has
relied on healthcare providers and the public to report
side effects, and on "ad hoc" research studies to investigate
possible rare associations between vaccines and identified
health conditions of interest to scientists. Today, Phase IV
trials and large-linked databases (LLDBs) have been added to
improve the capability to study rare risks of specific immu-
nizations. Phase IV studies can be an FDA requirement for
licensure. These trials include tens of thousands of volun-
teers and may address questions of long-term effectiveness
and safety or examine unanswered questions identified in
Phase III clinical trials. In 2001, the Clinical Immunization
Safety Assessment (CISA) Network was established which
works to increase understanding of vaccine reactions at the
individual patient level.

mandated that healthcare providers who administer
vaccines, and vaccine manufacturers report certain
adverse health events following specific vaccinations.
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a
national reporting system, jointly administered by CDC and
FDA. VAERS was created in 1990 to unify the collection of
all reports of adverse events after vaccination. VAERS is a
passive reporting system and accepts reports from health
professionals, vaccine manufacturers, and the general
public. Reports are submitted via mail and fax as well
as the Internet. All reports, whether submitted directly
to VAERS or via state or local public health authorities
or manufacturers, are coded and entered into the VAERS
database. VAERS receives about 28,000 US reports per year

(more than 371,000 as of December 31, 2010 (CDC unpub-
lished data]). Though this seems like a very large number,
it is relatively small compared with the approximately 100
million doses of childhood vaccines distributed during the
past decade, as well as the millions of additional doses
given to adults.
VAERS seeks to capture all clinically significant medical
events occurring postvaccination, even if the reporter is
not certain that the incident is vaccine related. Healthcare
providers are encouraged to report to VAERS any clinically
significant adverse events after immunization. From
2006 through 2010, US VAERS reports were received from
healthcare providers (34.8%), manufacturers (26.1%),
unknown or other reporters (24.5 %), patients or parents
(10.3%), and state and local health departments (4.4%).
Data collected on the VAERS reporting form include
information about the patient, the vaccination(s) given,
the reported health effect (called an adverse event—which
may or may not be caused by vaccine), and the person
reporting the event. Serious adverse event reports are
defined as those involving hospitalization or prolongation
of hospitalization, death, or reported life-threatening
illness, permanent disability or congenital anomaly. All
reports classified as serious are followed up to obtain addi-
tional medical information in order to provide as full a
picture of the case as possible. For serious reports, letters
to obtain information about recovery status are mailed to
the reporters at 60 days and 1 year after vaccination. All
records submitted to VAERS directly or as part of follow-up
activities are protected by strict confidentiality require-
ments.
.
Despite some limitations, VAERS has been able to fulfill its
primary purpose of detecting new or rare vaccine adverse
events, increases in rates of known side effects, and
patient risk factors for particular types of adverse events.
Examples include tracking reports of intussusception after
a rotavirus vaccine that is no longer used in the US, and
tracking the syncope reports after adolescent vaccines.
Additional studies are required to confirm signals detected
by VAERS because not all reported adverse events are
causally related to vaccine. (See “Reporting Suspected Side
Effects to VAERS” for detailed information on submitting
reports.) In addition, VAERS often provides early safety
data after a vaccine is licensed or during a public health
emergency

Vaccine Safety
Adverse Event Classification
Adverse Event Classifications and Assessment
of Causality
Adverse events following vaccination can be classified by
frequency (common, rare), extent (local, systemic), severity
(hospitalization, disability, and death), causality, and prevent-
ability (intrinsic to vaccine, faulty production, faulty adminis-
tration). Vaccine adverse events can be classified as follows:
14
. Vaccine-induced
• Vaccine-potentiated
• Programmatic error
• Coincidental
Vaccine-induced: Due to the intrinsic characteristic of the
vaccine preparation and the individual response of the
vaccinee. These events would not have occurred without
vaccination (e.g., vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis
after oral polio vaccine).
Vaccine-potentiated: The event would have occurred
anyway, but was precipitated by the vaccination (e.g., first
febrile seizure in a predisposed child).
Programmatic error: Due to technical errors in vaccine
storage, preparation, handling, or administration.
Coincidental: The reported event was not caused by
vaccination but happened by chance occurrence or due to
underlying illness.
It is natural to suspect a vaccine when a health problem
occurs following vaccination, but in reality a causal association
may or may not exist. More information would be needed
to establish a causal relationship. An adverse health event
can be causally attributed to vaccine more readily if: 1)
the health problem occurs during a plausible time period
following vaccination; 2) the adverse event corresponds to
those previously associated with a particular vaccine; 3)
the event conforms to a specific clinical syndrome whose
association with vaccination has strong biologic plausibility
(e.g., anaphylaxis) or occurs following the natural disease; 4)
a laboratory result confirms the association (e.g., isolation
of vaccine strain varicella virus from skin lesions of a patient
with rash); 5) the event recurs on re-administration of the
vaccine (“positive rechallenge”); 6) a controlled clinical trial or
epidemiologic study shows greater risk of a specific adverse
event among vaccinated versus unvaccinated (control) groups;
or 7) a finding linking an adverse event to vaccine has been
confirmed by other studies.
Vaccine Safety Datalink
In 1990, CDC established the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)
project to address gaps in the scientific knowledge of rare
vaccine side effects. This project involves partnerships with
10 large managed care organizations (MCOs) to monitor
vaccine safety. MCOs' site locations as of February 2011
are Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, Seattle,
Washington; Kaiser Permanente Northwest, Portland,

Each participating organization gathers data on vaccination
(vaccine type, date of vaccination, concurrent vaccinations),
medical outcomes (outpatient visits, inpatient visits, urgent
care visits), birth data, and census data.
The VSD project allows for planned immunization safety
studies, as well as timely investigations of hypotheses that
arise from review of medical literature, reports to VAERS

In 2005, the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project team
launched an active surveillance system called Rapid Cycle
Analysis (RCA). Its goal is to monitor adverse events following
vaccination in near real time, so the public can be informed
quickly of possible risks. RCA data come from participating
managed care organizations that include more than 9.2
million people annually, representing nearly 3% of the
United States population. The RCA data contain no personal

Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment
Network
Clinical Immunization Safety
Assessment (CISA) Network
• Improve understanding of vaccine
safety issues at individual level
• Evaluate persons who experience
adverse health events
• Gain better understanding of
events
• Develop protocols for healthcare
providers
The most recent addition to the postlicensure vaccine safety
monitoring system is the Clinical Immunization Safety
Assessment (CISA) Network, which is designed to improve
scientific understanding of vaccine safety issues at the indi-
vidual patient level. The CISA network's goal is to evaluate
persons who have experienced certain adverse health events
following vaccination. The results of these evaluations
will be used to gain a better understanding of how such
events might occur and to develop protocols or guidelines
for healthcare providers to help them make the right
assessments and manage similar situations. In addition,
the CISA centers serve as regional information resources
where complex clinical vaccine safety questions can be
referred by healthcare providers. Prior to the creation of
the CISA network, no coordinated facilities in the United
States investigated and managed vaccine side effects on an
individual level for the purposes of providing patient care
and systematically collecting and evaluating the experiences.

Established in 2001, the CISA network consists of six centers
of excellence with vaccine safety expertise working in
partnership with CDC. These centers are Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, Maryland; Boston University Medical
Center in Boston, Massachusetts; Columbia Presbyterian
Hospital in New York City; Vanderbilt University in Nashville,
Tennessee; Northern California Kaiser in Oakland, and
Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. For more infor-
mation about CISA, visit http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/
Activities/cisa.html.
Vaccine Analytic Unit
The Vaccine Analytic Unit (VAU) complements the other
critical CDC vaccine safety surveillance systems (VAERS, VSD,
and CISA). CDC established the VAU in 2003 in collaboration
with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and with input
from the FDA to evaluate longer term safety of vaccines
administered to young adults of military age. The VAU uses
data from the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS)
for its investigations. The DMSS is a unique source of active
surveillance data, and contains medical, vaccination and
deployment information for US military personnel (active
component is approximately 1.4 million individuals).
In 2006, VAU published its National Vaccine Advisory
Committee (NVAC) approved research agenda for inves-
tigating potential anthrax vaccine (AVA) adverse events.
Recently, the scope of the VAU's research focus has broad-
ened beyond AVA and biodefense vaccines to encompass
all vaccines used in the military population, with a goal of
improving military and civilian health. In addition to playing
an important role in monitoring the safety of new vaccines
administered to military personnel, such as the 2009 H1N1
pandemic influenza vaccine, and military-specific vaccines,
such as AVA, it provides the opportunity to study vaccines
that are infrequently administered in civilians (e.g., yellow
fever vaccine, smallpox vaccine and Japanese encephalitis
vaccine). Current projects focus on specific vaccines (AVA,
Tdap, Menactra) and specific potential vaccine-associated
diseases (autoimmune thyroid disease, diabetes, Guillain
Barré syndrome).
Vaccine Injury Compensation
The topic of vaccine safety was prominent during the mid-
1970s, with increases in lawsuits filed on behalf of those
presumably injured by the whole-cell pertussis component
of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DPT) vaccine. Legal decisions
were reached and damages awarded despite the lack of
scientific evidence to support vaccine injury claims. As a
result of the liability, prices soared and many manufacturers
halted vaccine production. A vaccine shortage resulted, and
52

public health officials became concerned about the return
of epidemic disease. To respond to these concerns, Congress
passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) in
1986.
4
Vaccine Injury
Compensation Program (VICP)
• Established by National
Childhood Vaccine Injury Act
(1986)
• "No fault" program
• Covers all routinely
recommended childhood
vaccines
• Vaccine Injury Table
As a result of the NCVIA, the National Vaccine Injury
Compensation Program (VICP) was established. This program
is intended to compensate individuals who experience
certain health events following vaccination on a “no fault”
basis. “No fault” means that persons filing claims are not
required to prove negligence on the part of either the
healthcare provider or manufacturer to receive compensa-
tion. The program covers all routinely recommended
childhood vaccinations, although adults who receive a
covered vaccine may also file a claim. Claims may be based
on a Vaccine Injury Table (Table) (Appendix F), which lists
the adverse events associated with vaccines and provides
a rebuttable presumption of causation, or by proving by
preponderant evidence that the vaccine caused an injury
not on the Table. This Table was developed initially by
Congress and has been modified by the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services over time
to better reflect current science regarding which serious
adverse events are reasonably certain to be caused by
vaccines. The Table was created to provide swift compensa-
tion to those possibly injured by vaccines. As more informa-
tion becomes available from research on vaccine side
effects, the Table will continue to be amended.
VICP has achieved its policy goals of providing compensation
to those injured by rare adverse events and liability protec-
tion for vaccine manufacturers and administrators. Further
information about the VICP is available at www.hrsa.gov/
vaccinecompensation/.
During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the govern-
ment implemented a new compensation program called
Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP). This
program provides compensation for certain individuals
who are seriously injured by countermeasures as specified
in a declaration by the Secretary of HHS. Both security
(bioterrorism) and pandemic countermeasures are covered.
The CICP currently covers serious adverse events caused by
pandemic influenza vaccines including the 2009 monovalent
H1N1 influenza vaccine that was widely distributed in the
2009 influenza season and any pandemic influenza vaccines
in clinical trials such as H5, H7, H9, etc. The CICP also
currently covers serious adverse events caused by anthrax,
smallpox, and botulism vaccines, including those used by
the Department of Defense. Covered countermeasures
within the CICP are not limited to vaccines and may include
certain medications or devices used to diagnose, prevent, or
treat the covered condition (currently pandemic influenza,

• Immunization providers can help
to ensure the safety and efficacy
of vaccines through proper:
-vaccine storage and
administration
-timing and spacing of vaccine
doses
-observation of contraindications
and precautions
The Immunization Provider's Role
Even though federal regulations require vaccines to undergo
years of testing before they can be licensed, and vaccines
are monitored continually for safety and efficacy, immuniza-
tion providers still play a key role in helping to ensure the
safety and efficacy of vaccines. They do this through proper
vaccine storage and administration, timing and spacing of
vaccine doses, observation of precautions and contraindica-
tions, management of vaccine side effects, reporting of
suspected side effects to VAERS, and educating patients and
parents about vaccine benefits and risks. Each of these steps
is described only briefly here. Further information is avail-
able elsewhere in this book or in resource materials from
CDC or other organizations.
Vaccine Storage and Administration
To achieve the best possible results from vaccines, immuniza-
tion providers should carefully follow the recommendations
found in each vaccine's package insert for storage, handling,
and administration. Other steps to help ensure vaccine safety
include: 1) inspecting vaccines upon delivery and monitoring
refrigerator and freezer temperatures to ensure maintenance
of the cold chain; 2) rotating vaccine stock so the oldest
vaccines are used first; 3) never administering a vaccine
later than the expiration date; 4) administering vaccines
within the prescribed time periods following reconstitution;
5) waiting to draw vaccines into syringes until immediately
prior to administration; 6) never mixing vaccines in the
same syringe unless they are specifically approved for mixing
by the FDA; and 7) recording vaccine and administration
information, including lot numbers and injection sites, in the
patient's record. If errors in vaccine storage and administra-
tion occur, corrective action should be taken immediately
to prevent them from happening again and public health
authorities should be notified. More information on vaccine
storage and handling is available in Appendix C and in CDC's
Vaccine Storage and Handling Toolkit, available at on the
CDC Vaccines and Immunizations website at www.cdc.gov/
vaccines.
Timing and Spacing
Timing and spacing of vaccine doses are two of the most
important issues in the appropriate use of vaccines. To
ensure optimal results from each immunization, providers
should follow the currently recommended immunization
schedules for children, adolescents, and adults. Decreasing
54

Vaccine Safety
the timing intervals between doses of the same vaccine may
interfere with the vaccine's antibody response. For more
specific information on timing and spacing of vaccines see
Chapter 2, General Recommendations on Immunization. A
table showing recommended minimum ages and intervals
between vaccine doses is contained in Appendix A.
.
Providers should also remember the following:
Administering all needed vaccines during the same visit is
important because it increases the likelihood that children
will be fully immunized as recommended. Studies have
shown that vaccines are as effective when administered
simultaneously as they are individually and carry no
greater risk for adverse reactions.
Some vaccines, such as pediatric diphtheria and tetanus,
produce increased rates of side effects when given too
frequently. Good recordkeeping, maintaining careful
patient histories, and adherence to recommended sched-
ules can decrease the chances that patients receive extra
doses of vaccines.
Contraindication
A condition in a recipient that
increases the chance of a
serious adverse reaction
Contraindications and Precautions
Contraindications and precautions to vaccination are conditions
that indicate when vaccines should not be given. A contraindi-
cation is a condition in a recipient that increases the chance of
a serious adverse reaction. In general, a vaccine should not be
administered when a contraindication is present. A precaution
is a condition in a recipient that might increase the chance
or severity of an adverse reaction or compromise the ability
of the vaccine to produce immunity. Normally, vaccination is
deferred when a precaution is present. Situations may arise
when the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risk of a side
effect, and the provider may decide to vaccinate the patient.
Most contraindications and precautions are temporary and the
vaccine may be given at a later time. More information about
contraindications can be found in the Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) statements for individual
vaccines. Recommendations for immunizing persons who are
immunocompromised can be found in Appendix A. Information
on allergic reactions to vaccines can be found in the American
Academy of Pediatrics Red Book.
Precaution
A condition in a recipient that
might
• Increase the chance or severity
of an adverse reaction, or
• Compromise the ability of the
vaccine to produce immunity
Screening for contraindications and precautions is key to
preventing serious adverse reactions to vaccines. Every provider
who administers vaccines should screen every patient before
giving a vaccine dose. Sample screening questionnaires
can be found in Chapter 2, General Recommendations on
Immunization. Many conditions are often inappropriately
regarded as contraindications to vaccination. In most cases, the
following are not considered contraindications:

Managing Vaccine Side Effects
Providers should use their best clinical judgment regarding
specific management of suspected vaccine side effects. Allergic
reactions to vaccines are estimated to occur after vaccina-
tion of children and adolescents at a rate of one for every
1.5 million doses of vaccine. All providers who administer
vaccines should have procedures in place and be prepared for
emergency care of a person who experiences an anaphylactic
reaction. Epinephrine and equipment for maintaining an
airway should be available for immediate use. All vaccine
providers should be familiar with the office emergency plan
and should be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
The Provider's Role
• Immunization providers can help
to ensure the safety and efficacy
of vaccines through proper:
-management of vaccine side

Reporting Suspected Side Effects to VAERS
Healthcare providers are required by the National Childhood
Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 to report certain adverse events
to VAERS and are encouraged to report any adverse event
even if they are not sure a vaccine was the cause. A table
listing reportable events is available at http://vaers.hhs.gov/

Vaccine Safety
When providers report suspected vaccine reactions to VAERS,
they provide valuable information that is needed for the
ongoing evaluation of vaccine safety. CDC and FDA use VAERS
information to ensure the safest strategies of vaccine use and
to further reduce the rare risks associated with vaccines.
Benefit and Risk Communication
Parents, guardians, legal representatives, and adolescent
and adult patients should be informed of the benefits and
risks of vaccines in understandable language. Opportunity
for questions should be provided before each vaccination.
Discussion of the benefits and risks of vaccination is sound
medical practice and is required by law.
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires that
vaccine information materials be developed for each vaccine
covered by the Act. These materials, known as "Vaccine
Information Statements (VISs),” must be provided by all
public and private vaccination providers before each dose
of vaccine. Copies of VISs are available from state health
authorities responsible for immunization, or they can be
obtained from CDC's website at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/
vis/default.htm or from the Immunization Action Coalition
at http://www.immunize.org. Translations of Viss into
languages other than English are available from certain state
immunization programs and from the Immunization Action
Coalition website. Further information about VISs and their
use is contained in Appendix E.
Benefit and Risk
Communication
Healthcare providers should anticipate questions that
parents or patients may have regarding the need for or
safety of vaccination. A few may refuse certain vaccines,
or even reject all vaccinations. Some persons might have
religious or personal objections to vaccinations. Having a
basic understanding of how patients view vaccine risk and
developing effective approaches to dealing with vaccine
safety concerns when they arise are imperative for vaccina-
tion providers. Healthcare providers can accomplish this by
assessing patients' specific concerns and information needs,
providing them with accurate information, and referring
them to credible sources for more information. The CDC's
website contains extensive and up-to-date information on
vaccine safety issues http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/.
• Opportunities for questions should
be provided before each vaccination
• Vaccine Information Statements (VISs)
- must be provided before each dose
of vaccine
- public and private providers
- available in multiple languages
When a parent or patient initiates discussion regarding a
vaccine concern, the healthcare provider should discuss
the specific concern and provide factual information, using
language that is appropriate. Effective, empathetic vaccine
risk communication is essential in responding to misinforma-
tion and concerns. The Vaccine Information Statements
provide an outline for discussing vaccine benefits and risk.

Rather than excluding from their practice those patients
who question or refuse vaccination, the more effective
public health strategy for providers is to identify common
ground and discuss measures to be followed if the patient's
decision is to defer vaccination. Healthcare providers can
reinforce key points regarding each vaccine, including safety,
and emphasize risks encountered by unimmunized children.
Parents should be informed about state laws pertaining to
school or child care entry, which might require that unim-
munized children stay home from school during outbreaks.
Documentation of these discussions in the patient's record,
including the refusal to receive certain vaccines (i.e.,
informed refusal), might reduce any potential liability if a
vaccine-preventable disease occurs in the unimmunized
patient

Vaccine Storage and Handling
This chapter provides best practice guidance for storage
and handling. Additional resources are available in
Appendix C.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
There are few immunization issues more important than
the appropriate storage and handling of vaccines. The
success of efforts against vaccine-preventable diseases
is attributable in part to proper storage and handling of
vaccines. Vaccines exposed to temperatures outside the
recommended ranges can have reduced potency and
protection. Storage and handling errors can cost thousands
of dollars in wasted vaccine and revaccination. Errors can
also result in the loss of patient confidence when repeat
doses are required. It is better to not vaccinate than to
administer a dose of vaccine that has been mishandled.
Vaccine management, including proper storage and
handling procedures, is the basis on which good immuniza-
tion practices are built.

• Storage and handling errors
- reduced potency and effectiveness
- cost thousands of dollars in wasted vaccine and
revaccination
- loss of patient confidence
• It is better to not vaccinate than to

mishandled
Vaccines must be stored properly from the time they
are manufactured until they are administered. Proper
maintenance of vaccines during transport is known as the
cold chain. A proper cold chain is a temperature-controlled
supply chain that includes all equipment and procedures
used in the transport and storage and handling of vaccines
from the time of manufacturer to administration of the
vaccine. By following a few simple steps and implementing
best storage and handling practices, providers can ensure
that patients will get the full benefit of vaccines they
receive.

Vaccine Storage Temperatures
• Live vaccines
Vaccine Storage Temperatures
Vaccines are fragile. They must be maintained at the
temperatures recommended by vaccine manufacturers
and protected from light at every link in the cold chain.
Most live virus vaccines tolerate freezing temperatures, but
deteriorate rapidly after they are removed from storage.
Inactivated vaccines can be damaged by exposure to
temperature fluctuations (e.g., extreme heat or freezing
temperatures). Potency can be adversely affected if
vaccines are left out too long or exposed to multiple
temperature excursions (out-of-range temperatures) that
can have a cumulative negative effect. It is a good idea to
post a sign on the front of the storage unit(s) indicating
which vaccines should be stored in the freezer and which
should be stored in the refrigerator.

and varicella (MMRV) should also be stored frozen between
-58°F and +5°F (-50°C to -15°C). If varicella and zoster
vaccines are stored in the freezer with MMRV, keep the
temperature between -58°F and +5°F (-50°C to -15°C).

average
The measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR) can be stored
either in the freezer or the refrigerator. When stored in
the freezer, the temperature should be the same as that
required for MMRV, between -58°F and +5°F (-50°C to
-15°C). Storing MMR in the freezer with MMRV may help
prevent inadvertent storage of MMRV in the refrigerator.
Refrigerator
All inactivated vaccines require refrigerator storage
temperatures between 35°F and 46°F (2°C to 8°C), with a
desired average temperature of 40°F (5°C). The following
live attenuated vaccines must also be kept at refrigerator
temperature: influenza (LAIV, Flumist); rotavirus (RV1,
Rotarix and RV5, RotaTeq); typhoid (Ty21-A, Vivotif); and
yellow fever (YF-Vax). Review each manufacturer's instruc-
tions in the product information for vaccine specific storage
temperatures.
Before reconstitution with diluent, all varicella-containing
vaccines (VAR, Varivax; ZOS, Zostavax; and MMRV, ProQuad)
can be stored at refrigerator temperature between 35°F and
46°F (2°C to 8°C) for up to 72 hours. Any varicella-containing
vaccine stored at refrigerator temperature should be
discarded if it is not used within 72 hours. Once they are
thawed, varicella-containing vaccines cannot be refrozen.

Vaccine Storage and Handling Plans
Storage and Handling Plans
Written routine and emergency storage and handling plans
should be developed and maintained. Guidelines for devel-
oping routine and emergency plans are included in CDC's
Storage and Handling Toolkit available at http://www2a.cdc.
gov/vaccines/ed/shtoolkit.
• Develop and maintain written routine plan for:
- ordering and accepting vaccine deliveries;
- storing and handling vaccines;
- managing inventory; and,
- managing potentially compromised vaccines
• Develop and maintain written emergency vaccine
retrieval and storage plan
- backup storage location with appropriate storage units,
temperature monitoring capability, and backup generator
- adequate coolers or refrigerated truck
A routine storage and handling plan provides guidelines for
daily activities, such as:
ordering and accepting vaccine deliveries;
storing and handling vaccines;
managing inventory; and,
managing potentially compromised vaccines.
62


## p. 63 (#77) ##############################################

Vaccine Storage and Handling
Every clinic should also have an emergency vaccine retrieval
and storage plan. The plan should be easily accessible to
staff and identify a backup location where the vaccine can
be stored. Considerations when choosing this site include
appropriate storage units, temperature monitoring capability
and a backup generator. Potential backup locations might
include a local hospital, pharmacy, long-term care facility, or
the Red Cross.
Coolers or a refrigerated truck adequate to accommodate
the clinic's vaccine supply should be available to move
vaccines if needed. It is a good idea to place a copy of the
most current emergency plan, guidelines for safe transport
of vaccines, and a flashlight in the cooler for staff reference.
It is difficult to pack coolers correctly or to locate policy
manuals in the dark during a power outage.
Power outages or natural disasters are not the only events
that can compromise vaccine. Forgotten vials of vaccine left
out on the counter or doses of vaccine stored at improper
temperatures due to a storage unit failure are other
examples of how vaccines can be potentially compromised.
Protocols after an event will vary depending on individual
state or agency policies. Contact the local or state immu-
nization program (hereafter referred to as “immunization
program”), vaccine manufacturer(s), or both for appropriate
actions or guidelines that should be followed for all poten-
tially compromised vaccine.
Personnel, Training and Education
51
Personnel, Training and Education
A primary vaccine coordinator who is responsible for
ensuring that vaccines are stored and handled correctly
should be assigned at each facility. At least one backup
vaccine coordinator who can perform these responsibilities
in the absence of the primary coordinator should be desig-
nated. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to
the following tasks:
Assign responsibilities to a primary
vaccine coordinator
Designate at least one backup person
• Provide training and continuing
education on vaccine storage and
handling for staff

Training and Education
Personnel who
- handle or administer vaccines
- deliver or accept vaccine shipments
- have access to vaccine storage unit(s)
• Provide training and continuing education
when
- new or temporary staff are oriented
- new vaccines are stocked
- changes in storage and handling guidelines occur
All personnel who handle or administer vaccines should
be familiar with the storage and handling policies and
procedures for their facility. This includes not only those who
administer vaccines, but also anyone who delivers or accepts
vaccine shipments and anyone who has access to the unit(s)
where vaccines are stored. These policies and procedures
should be available in writing as a reference for all staff
members. Vaccine storage and handling training should be
provided to all new personnel who handle or administer
vaccines, including temporary staff. Continuing education for
staff is essential when new vaccines are stocked and when
there are any changes to the storage and handling guidelines
for a particular vaccine. Immunization programs often have
good resources for staff training.
15
Vaccine Storage Equipment
Vaccine Storage Equipment
Vaccine storage equipment should be selected carefully,
used properly, maintained regularly (including profession-
ally serviced when needed), and monitored consistently to
ensure the recommended temperatures are maintained.
This chapter provides general guidelines for vaccine storage
equipment. Providers should consult their immunization
program, particularly those who provide federally funded
vaccines, for any specific storage equipment requirements.
• Select carefully; use properly; maintain regularly;
monitor consistently
• Consult immunization program for any specific
requirements
Keep an equipment logbook
equipment serial number
equipment installation date
dates of routine maintenance
- dates of service/repairs and contact information on service
provider
equipment instructions
.
It is good practice to keep a logbook for each piece of
vaccine storage equipment. The serial number of each
piece of equipment, the date each piece of equipment was
installed, the dates of any routine maintenance tasks (such
as cleaning), the dates of any repairs or servicing, and the
name and contact information of the person or company
performing each of these tasks should be recorded. A

logbook is also an ideal place to keep the instructions that
came with the equipment.
Freezers and Refrigerators
Freezers and Refrigerators
Using the correct freezer and/or refrigerator can help
prevent costly vaccine losses and the inadvertent adminis-
tration of compromised vaccines. Freezers and refrigerators
are available in many different sizes, types (e.g., stand-
alone versus combination), and grades (e.g., household,
commercial, and pharmaceutical). Stand-alone freezers
and refrigerators without freezers are preferred because
studies have demonstrated they maintain the required
temperatures better than combination units. Any freezer
or refrigerator used for vaccine storage should have its own
exterior door that seals tightly and properly, as well as ther-
mostat controls. It must be able to maintain the required
temperature range throughout the year. The unit should be
dedicated to the storage of biologics and it must be large
enough to hold the year's largest vaccine inventory without
crowding (including flu vaccine). A storage unit that is frost-
free or has an automatic defrost cycle is preferred. If using a
combination freezer-refrigerator unit to store vaccines, care
must be taken to ensure that the freezer is not so cold that
the refrigerator temperature drops below the recommended
temperature range. There should be separate temperature
controls (thermostats) for the freezer and refrigerator
compartments.

preferred)
• Freezer and refrigerator compartments must each
have own exterior door and thermostat controls

- allow minimum of 4 inches between storage unit
and a wall
- do not block motor cover
- ensure unit stands level with at least 1-2 inches

5
Good air circulation around the vaccine storage unit is
essential for proper heat exchange and cooling functions.
The unit should be in a well-ventilated room with space
around the sides and top and at least 4 inches between
the unit and a wall. Nothing should block the cover of the
motor compartment and the unit should be level and stand
firmly with at least 1 to 2 inches between the bottom of the
unit and the floor.
Any vaccine storage in a dormitory-style refrigerator is
not recommended by CDC. A dormitory-style refrigerator is
defined as a small combination freezer/refrigerator unit that
is outfitted with one exterior door and an evaporator plate
(cooling coil), which is usually located inside an icemaker
compartment (freezer) within the refrigerator. Based on
research published in December 2009, the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) concluded that “the
dorm-style refrigerator is NOT recommended for vaccine
storage under any circumstance." In performance testing,
the dormitory-style refrigerator demonstrated consistently
unacceptable performance, regardless of where the vaccine
was placed inside the unit.
Dormitory-style Refrigerator
• Small combination
freezer/refrigerator unit with one
external door and an evaporator plate

• NOT recommended for vaccine
storage
Dormitory-style (or bar-style) combined freezer/refrigerator
units should never be used for permanent vaccine storage.
65


## p. 66 (#80) ##############################################

Vaccine Storage and Handling
If this type of unit is used for temporary storage of small
quantities of non-varicella-containing vaccines, only the
refrigerator compartment should be used. The freezer
compartment in this type of unit is incapable of maintaining
temperatures cold enough to store frozen vaccine. The unit
must consistently maintain between 35°F and 46°F (2°C to
8°C). The unit should not be overstocked and vaccines should
not be placed directly beside or directly below the freezer
compartment. This may expose vaccines to temperatures
below the recommended range. Cold packs, which have not
been frozen, or water bottles should be placed on the shelf
between the vaccine and the freezer compartment and in the
door. This will provide a temperature buffer. The vaccines
should be returned to the main storage unit at the end of the
clinic day; vaccines should never be left overnight in a dormi-
tory- or bar-style refrigerator. Even for temporary storage,
CDC recommends using a compact refrigerator without a
freezer compartment rather than a dormitory-style combined
freezer/refrigerator to reduce the risk of exposing vaccine to
freezing temperatures.
Thermometers
• Use calibrated thermometers with a
Certificate of Traceability and Calibration
from an ISO 17025 accredited testing lab,
NIST, or another internationally recognized
standards agency
- digital
- bio-safe liquid
- continuous graphic
- minimum/maximum
Thermometers
Thermometers are a critical part of good storage and
handling practice. The freezer and the refrigerator unit or
compartment should each have its own thermometer. There
are a variety of types, including digital, bio-safe liquid,
continuous graphic, and minimum/maximum thermometers.
For measuring vaccine storage unit temperatures, CDC recom-
mends using only calibrated thermometers with a Certificate
of Traceability and Calibration. The traceability declaration is
to confirm that the measurement standards and instruments
used during calibration of the product are from an ISO 17025
(International Organization of Standardization) accredited
testing laboratory, to NIST, or to another internationally
recognized standards agency.
5
Because all thermometers are calibrated as part of the
manufacturing process, this recommendation refers to a
second calibration process that occurs after manufacturing
but before marketing and is documented with a certificate
that comes with the product. Periodic recalibration is
necessary. Manufacturer guidelines should be consulted
for specific information on recalibration. For many types of
thermometers, purchasing a replacement thermometer may
be less expensive than recalibration. Immunization programs
are often excellent resources for information on calibrated
thermometers.
Temperature Monitoring
Regular temperature monitoring is vital to proper cold
chain management. Temperatures in both the freezer and
refrigerator units should be read twice each day, once in the
66

Vaccine Storage and Handling
.
morning and once before leaving at the end of the workday.
A temperature log should be posted on the door of the
storage unit where the twice daily temperature readings are
recorded. CDC recommends keeping these temperature logs
for at least 3 years unless state statutes or rules require a
longer period. As the storage unit ages, recurring tempera-
ture variances or problems can be tracked and documented.
This data can be important when evaluating the need for a
new storage unit or if there is a potential need to recall and
revaccinate patients because of improperly stored vaccine.
Temperature Monitoring
Temperatures in both the freezer and
refrigerator units should be read and
recorded twice each day
- once in the morning and once before
leaving at the end of the workday
• Post temperature log on the door of the
storage unit
Keep temperature logs for at least 3 years
unless state statutes or rules require a longer
period
Some providers have purchased alarmed, continuous, auto-
matic, temperature monitoring devices. CDC's recommenda-
tion is to continue manual temperature monitoring at least
twice daily. Although they may help to minimize human
error, the alarmed and continuous monitoring temperature
devices have not proven fail safe. CDC continues to receive
reports of automatic electronic monitoring system failures
and undetected, unresolved vaccine temperature excursions
using these systems as the sole equipment temperature
monitor. Manually recording temperatures provides an
opportunity to visually inspect the storage unit, reorganize
the vaccine when necessary (e.g., moving vaccine away
from walls or cold air vents), identify vaccines with short
expiration dates, remove any expired vaccines, and provide a
timely response to temperature excursions.
It is inevitable that manual temperature monitoring may not
be accomplished when a provider's office is closed, however.
In that case, the electronic monitoring system can provide
a backup for assurance that storage temperatures remain
within vaccine manufacturers' recommended ranges and
that corrective action can be taken quickly if they go out
of range. Providers should determine how they are to be
notified in the event of an emergency (e.g. a power outage)
during hours when the clinic is not open.
51
Thermometer placement within the unit is just as important
as thermometer selection. Prior to storing vaccines in a unit,
the temperature should be allowed to stabilize and then be
measured in various locations within the unit to document
that a consistent temperature can be maintained. This can
detect if there are any particular cold or hot spots where
vaccine should not be placed, as well as determining where
the most reliable, consistent thermometer reading can be
obtained. New units may need 2 or more days of operation
to establish a stable operating temperature.
If at any time it is discovered that stored vaccines have
been exposed to temperatures outside the recommended
ranges, these vaccines should remain properly stored, but
segregated and marked "Do NOT Use" until guidance can
be obtained. Protocols after an event will vary depending
on individual state or agency policies. Contact the immu-

nization program, vaccine manufacturer(s), or both for
guidance.
Vaccine Placement and Labeling
• Store vaccine away from unit walls, coils,
and vents
• Keep vaccines in original packaging
• Stack in rows with same type of vaccine
• Use uncovered storage containers with
slotted sides or openings
• Use labels with vaccine names and age
indications or color coding
• Protect vaccine from light
Vaccine Placement and Labeling
A storage unit should be big enough so that vaccines can
be placed away from the walls, coils, and vents in the part
of the unit best able to maintain the constant, required
temperature. Vaccines should be kept in their original
packaging with the lids in place until ready for administra-
tion and stacked in rows with vaccine of the same type.
Bins, baskets, or some other type of uncovered containers
with slotted sides or openings can be used to store the
vaccines. There should be space between the vaccine stacks
or containers. These measures will help to avoid confu-
sion between vaccines, provide for air circulation around
and through vaccine stacks for even cooling, and protect
vaccines from unnecessary light exposure. Not only live
attenuated vaccines, but also some inactivated vaccines
must be protected from light. The manufacturer's product
information indicates if the vaccine must be protected from
light.
Diluent Storage
• Diluent is shipped with the corresponding
vaccine
• Store diluent as directed in manufacturer's
product information
• Store refrigerated diluent with corresponding
vaccine (these diluents may contain vaccine
antigen)
• Do not freeze diluents
• Label diluent to avoid inadvertent use of the
wrong diluent when reconstituting a vaccine
Vaccines that must be reconstituted are shipped with
diluent specific to that vaccine. Vaccine diluents are not all
the same, some contain vaccine antigen. As with vaccines,
diluents should be stored according to the guidelines in
the manufacturer's product information. When feasible,
diluents that require refrigeration should be stored with
their corresponding vaccines. Never store any diluent in
the freezer because the vials are not designed for freezer
storage and could crack. (See job aid in Appendix C)
15
Each vaccine and diluent stack or container should be
clearly labeled. This can be accomplished by attaching
labels directly to the shelves on which vaccines and diluents
are sitting or by placing labels on the containers. It may be
helpful to use color coding (e.g., one color for pediatric and
another for adult) or include the age indications for each
vaccine type on the labels. Having each vaccine and diluent
stack or container labeled helps decrease the chance that
someone will inadvertently administer the wrong vaccine
or use the wrong diluent to reconstitute a vaccine. Vaccines
that sound or look alike should not be stored next to each
other, e.g. DTP and Tdap.
Vaccine Storage Troubleshooting
To maintain the proper temperature ranges, the freezer and
refrigerator must be in good working condition and they
must have power at all times. There are several things that
can be done to prevent problems.
Storage units should be plugged directly into wall outlets;
68


## p. 69 (#83) ##############################################

Vaccine Storage and Handling
Preventive Measures
Plug unit directly into wall; do NOT use multi-
strip outlet
multi-strip outlets should not be used. Plug guards or
safety-lock plugs should be put in place to prevent someone
from inadvertently unplugging the unit. A temperature
alarm system that will alert staff to after-hour temperature
excursions, particularly if large vaccine inventories are
maintained, may be helpful in assuring a timely response to
storage problems. The circuit breakers can also be labeled to
alert janitors and electricians not to unplug vaccine storage
units or turn off the power. This can be done by posting a
warning sign near the electrical outlet, on the storage unit,
and at the circuit breaker box. The warning sign should
include emergency contact information.
.
.
• Use a plug guard or safety-lock plug
Install a temperature alarm
Label circuit breakers
• Use water bottles in the refrigerator and ice
packs in the freezer to maintain temperature
Containers of water, labeled “Do NOT Drink,” can be placed
in the refrigerator to help stabilize the temperature in the
unit. If the refrigerator unit has vegetable/fruit bins, these
should be removed. If there is a shelf holding the vegetable/
fruit bins in place, it should also be removed. The water
containers can then be put in place of the vegetable/fruit
bins. Deli drawers should also be removed. The same prin-
ciple applies to the freezer. Extra frozen packs or blue ice
can be stored in the freezer. These measures will help keep
the temperature stable with frequent opening and closing of
the doors.
Preventive Measures
Vaccines should never be stored in the door of the freezer
or refrigerator. The temperatures in these areas are not
stable. The door of the freezer can be used to store extra
frozen packs or blue ice and the door of the refrigerator
can be used to store extra water containers or diluents that
do not contain vaccine antigen. Frozen packs and water
bottles stored in the doors should be placed securely so that
they cannot dislodge and prevent the door from closing. In
addition, caution must be taken to avoid weighing down the
doors so much that the seals are compromised when the
doors are closed.
• DO NOT store vaccine in vegetable/fruit bins,
deli drawers, or doors
• Perform daily inspection of storage unit(s)
• If other biologics must be stored in the same
unit, store them BELOW the vaccines to avoid
contamination
Never store food and beverages in the same
unit with vaccines
• Take immediate corrective action when there
is a problem
51
.
In addition to temperature monitoring, a physical inspection
of the storage unit should be performed daily. An inspection
should include the following:
Are the vaccines placed properly in the unit?
Are the vaccines in their original boxes?
Are vaccines being stored away from the walls, coils, and
vent and not being stored in the doors?
During a vaccine clinic day it is easy for vaccines to
be shifted into an area of the storage unit where the
temperature may not be appropriate or stable, such as
against a wall, under a cold air vent or in the door. Vaccine
purchased with public funds should be identified and stored
separately from privately purchased vaccines.
69


## p. 70 (#84) ##############################################

Vaccine Storage and Handling
CDC recommends that vaccines be kept in storage units
dedicated only to vaccines. If other biologic specimens must
be stored in the same unit as vaccines, specimens should be
stored on a lower shelf than the vaccines. This is to ensure
that if a specimen leaks, the vaccine will not be contami-
nated. Food and beverages should not be stored in a vaccine
storage unit because frequent opening of the unit can lead
to temperature instability.
While it is important to take measures to prevent problems,
equally important is taking immediate corrective action
when a problem does exist, for example when the storage
unit temperature falls outside the recommended range. It is
very important that staff know whom to contact in case of a
malfunction or disaster.
If the problem is short-term (usually 2 hours or less) and
depending on outside ambient temperature, the storage unit
temperature can probably be maintained with the water
containers in the refrigerator, with frozen packs or blue ice
in the freezer, and by keeping the unit doors closed. If there
is an extended period of time before the situation can be
corrected and there are no other storage units available on
site, the vaccine should be moved to the backup storage
facility using the guidelines in the emergency plan.
Vaccine Inventory Control
5
• Conduct a monthly vaccine and diluent
inventory
• Order vaccine responsibly based on
- projected demand
- storage capacity
-current supply
Request delivery during office hours
Vaccine Inventory Control
A vaccine inventory should be conducted monthly to ensure
adequate supply to meet demand. Vaccine diluents should
also be included in the inventory to ensure adequate
supplies are available. Determining factors for the amount
of vaccine and diluent ordered include: projected demand,
storage capacity, and current vaccine supply. Vaccine coor-
dinators should request delivery during office hours. Each
vaccine order should be updated to reflect any period of
time the office will be closed, such as holidays or scheduled
vacation time.
Expiration Dates
• Monitor vaccine and diluent expiration dates
closely
• Rotate stock so that vaccine and diluent with
shortest expiration dates are used first
• If normal in appearance and stored and handled
properly, product can be used
- through end of day indicated if expiration date is
mm/dd/yyyy (e.g., 12/15/2012 - use through
12/15/2012)
- through end of month indicated it expiration date is
mm/yyyy (e.g., 12/2012 - use through 12/31/2012)
It is also important to avoid overstocking vaccine supplies
which could lead to vaccine wastage or having outdated
vaccine on hand. Vaccine and diluent expiration dates
should be closely monitored. Rotate stock so that vaccine
and diluent with the shortest expiration date are used first
to avoid waste from expiration. If the date on the label has
a specific month, day, and year, the vaccine can be used
through the end of that day. If the expiration date on the
label is a month and year, the vaccine can be used through
the end of that month. A multidose vial of vaccine that has
been stored and handled properly and is normal in appear-
ance can be used through the expiration date printed on the
vial unless otherwise stated in the manufacturer's product
information. Mark a multidose vial with the date it is first
70


## p. 71 (#85) ##############################################

Vaccine Storage and Handling
opened. Mark reconstituted vaccine with the date and time
it is reconstituted. The expiration date or time might change
once the vaccine is opened or reconstituted. This informa-
tion is provided in the manufacturer's product information.
Expired vaccine and diluent should never be used and
should be promptly removed from the storage unit.
Expiration Dates
• Multidose vials
- can be used through expiration date on label
unless otherwise stated in manufacturer's
product information
- mark with date first opened
Reconstituted vaccine
- once reconstituted use within timeframe
indicated by manufacturer or discard
• Never use expired vaccine or diluent
.
Receiving and Unpacking Vaccine
Shipments
Proper vaccine storage and handling is important from the
moment the vaccine arrives at the facility. All office staff
should be informed of who to notify when a vaccine delivery
has arrived. This is extremely important for receptionists or
other front desk staff since they are often the first to know
that vaccines have been delivered. Vaccine shipments should
be inspected on arrival. Vaccines should be stored at the
proper temperature immediately upon arrival. The shipping
container and its contents should be examined for any
evidence of damage during transport. The contents should
be cross checked with the packing slip to be sure they match.
Both heat and cold temperature monitors/indicators should
be checked upon delivery following instructions on the
monitors for reading and reporting. If a monitor indicates
possible adverse temperature excursion during shipping,
the monitor reading should be documented for future
reference and reported to the distributor within the required
timeframe if VFC vaccine is involved. Shipments sent directly
by the vaccine manufacturer are in specially designed boxes
and may not contain heat or cold temperature monitors.
Vaccine Shipments
Inspect vaccine shipments
container
- contents
- shipping temperature monitors/indicators
• If there are concerns, store vaccines properly,
but segregate from other vaccines and mark
"Do NOT Use"
• Consult immunization program or vaccine
manufacturer for guidance
5
The shipment date should be checked to determine how
long the package was in transit. If the interval between
shipment from the distributor and arrival of the product at
the facility was more than 48 hours, this could mean the
vaccine has been exposed to excessive heat or cold that
might alter its integrity. If there are any discrepancies with
the packing slip or concerns about the vaccine shipment,
the vaccines should be stored in proper conditions, but
segregated and marked “Do NOT Use” until the integrity of
the vaccines is determined. Contact either the immunization
program or the vaccine manufacturer, depending on who
shipped the vaccine and the state or agency policy.
The contents of each shipment should be recorded on
an inventory log (stock record). This log should include
the name of each vaccine, the number of doses for each
vaccine received, the date it was received, the condition
of the vaccines upon arrival, the name of the vaccine
manufacturers, the lot numbers, the expiration dates for
each vaccine, and any action taken as a result of a question
of vaccine integrity. (See sample stock record in CDC Storage
and Handling Toolkit).

Vaccine Storage and Handling
Vaccine Transport to Off-Site Clinics
• Maintain cold chain at all times
• Contact immunization program for specific policies
regarding vaccine transport
• Diluent should travel with its corresponding vaccine
• Monitor temperature hourly if vaccine kept in
cooler during off-site clinic
• Patient transport of vaccine (e.g., zoster) from
pharmacy to clinic for administration is not an
acceptable transport method for any vaccine
Vaccine Transport to Off-Site Clinics
The number of times vaccines are handled and transported
should be minimized. If vaccine transportation to another
location is required, it is critical that vaccine potency
is protected by maintaining the cold chain at all times.
Some immunization programs may recommend or require
different vaccine transport practices and procedures.
Providers should contact their immunization program for
details on how to pack vaccine and diluent for transport and
procedures for maintaining the cold chain in the field. An
illustrated job aid detailing general guidelines on packing
refrigerated vaccines for transport is available in Appendix C.
When a multidose vial is used, Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regulations require that it be used only
by the provider's office where it was first opened. A partially
used vial may be transported to or from off-site clinics
operated by the same provider as long as the cold chain
is properly maintained. However, such a vial may not be
transferred to another provider or transported across state
lines. While there is no defined limit to the number of times
vaccine may be transported to different clinic sites, each
transport increases the risk that vaccine will be exposed to
inappropriate storage conditions.

Diluent should travel with its corresponding vaccine to
ensure that there are always equal numbers of vaccine vials
and diluent vials for reconstitution. Diluent should be trans-
ported at room temperature or inside the same insulated
cooled container as the corresponding vaccine, according
to manufacturer guidelines for each diluent. If transported
inside cooled containers, diluent must not be in direct
contact with frozen or cold packs because of the potential
for freezing. If any diluents that have been stored at room
temperature are going to be carried in the insulated trans-
port container, refrigerate the diluents in advance so they
do not raise the temperature of the refrigerated vaccines.
Do NOT transport any diluent, including the diluent for
varicella-containing vaccines, on dry ice.
Transport of Varicella-Containing
Vaccine to Off-Site Clinics
• CDC discourages transport of varicella-containing
vaccines to off-site clinics
• Manufacturer recommends transport and storage at
refrigerator temperatures, 35°F to 46°F (2°C to 8°c), for
no more than 72 continuous hours prior to
reconstitution
• Discard if not used within 72 hours
• Discard reconstituted vaccine if not used within 30
minutes
• Varicella-containing vaccines cannot be refrozen
• Contact immunization program for advice and details
Transporting Varicella-Containing Vaccines to
Off-Site Clinics
CDC strongly discourages transport of varicella-containing
vaccines to off-site clinics. Varicella-containing vaccines
(VAR, Varivax; MMRV, ProQuad; ZOS, Zostavax) are fragile. If
these vaccines must be transported to an off-site clinic, the
vaccine manufacturer recommends they be transported and
stored at refrigerator temperatures, between 35°F and 46°F
(2°C to 8°C), for no more than 72 continuous hours prior
to reconstitution. Packing and temperature monitoring as
outlined in Appendix C also applies. Vaccine stored between
35°F and 46°F (2°C to 8°C) that is not used within 72 hours

Vaccine Storage and Handling
of removal from the freezer should be discarded. Discard
reconstituted vaccine if it is not used within 30 minutes.
Varicella-containing vaccines cannot be refrozen. Providers
should contact their immunization program for advice and
details.
Having a patient pick up a dose of vaccine (e.g., zoster
vaccine) at a pharmacy and transporting it in a bag to a
clinic for administration is not an acceptable transport
method for zoster vaccine or any other vaccine.
Temperature Monitoring During Off-Site Clinics
Vaccines should be transferred to a refrigerator with the
appropriate temperature immediately upon arrival at
the clinic. Routine temperature readings should be taken
and recorded on a temperature log. If vaccine must be
maintained in an insulated cooler during an off-site clinic,
keep the cooler closed as much as possible. CDC recom-
mends that, at a minimum, vaccine temperatures should be
checked and recorded hourly.
Vaccine Preparation
Vaccine should be drawn from the vial into the syringe
at the time of administration. CDC strongly discourages
providers from filling syringes in advance, for a number of
reasons. Filling a syringe before it is needed increases the
risk for administration errors. Once in the syringe, vaccines
are difficult to tell apart. Other problems associated with
this practice are wasted vaccine and possible bacterial
growth in vaccines that do not contain a preservative, such
as vaccines supplied in single-dose vials.
5
Do Not Prefill Syringes
• Increases the risk for administration errors
• Wasted vaccine
Syringes other than those filled by the manufacturer
are designed for immediate administration and not for
vaccine storage. If for some reason more than one dose
of a particular vaccine must be predrawn, draw up only
a few syringes at one time (no more than 10 doses or the
contents of a single multidose vial). In accordance with best
practice standards, these syringes should be administered
by the person who filled them. Any syringes prefilled by the
provider must be stored at the recommended temperature
range and used or discarded by the end of the clinic day.
• Possible bacterial growth in vaccines that do not
contain a preservative
• Administration syringes not designed for storage
• Any syringes prefilled by the provider must be
stored at the recommended temperature range
and used that day or discarded at the end of the
clinic day
As an alternative to prefilling syringes, CDC recommends
use of manufacturer-supplied prefilled syringes for large
immunization events, such as community influenza clinics.
These syringes are designed for both storage and administra-
tion. Once a manufacturer prefilled syringe is activated (i.e.,
syringe cap removed or needle attached), the sterile seal is
broken. The syringe should be used that day or discarded at
the end of the clinic day.
Prefilling Syringes
Consider using manufacturer-supplied
prefilled syringes for large immunization
events because they are designed for both
storage and administration
• Do not "activate" (remove syringe cap or
attach needle) until ready to administer the
vaccine; "activation” breaks the sterile seal
• Any unused activated syringe should be
discarded at end of clinic day

Diphtheria
Diphtheria
Diphtheria
Diphtheria is an acute, toxin-mediated disease caused by
the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The name of
the disease is derived from the Greek diphthera, meaning
leather hide. The disease was described in the 5th century
BCE by Hippocrates, and epidemics were described in the
6th century AD by Aetius. The bacterium was first observed
in diphtheritic membranes by Klebs in 1883 and cultivated
by Löffler in 1884. Antitoxin was invented in the late 19th
century, and toxoid was developed in the 1920s.
• Greek diphthera (leather hide)
• Recognized by Hippocrates in
5th century BCE
• Epidemics described in
6th century
• C. diphtheriae described by Klebs
in 1883
• Toxoid developed in 1920s
6
Corynebacterium diphtheriae
Corynebacterium diphtheriae
C. diphtheriae is an aerobic gram-positive bacillus. Toxin
production (toxigenicity) occurs only when the bacillus is
itself infected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacteriophage)
carrying the genetic information for the toxin (tox gene).
Only toxigenic strains can cause severe disease.
• Aerobic gram-positive bacillus
• Toxin production occurs only
when C. diphtheriae infected by
virus (phage) carrying tox gene
• If isolated, must be distinguished
from normal diphtheroid
Culture of the organism requires selective media containing
tellurite. If isolated, the organism must be distinguished
in the laboratory from other Corynebacterium species that
normally inhabit the nasopharynx and skin (e.g., diphtheroids).
C. diphtheriae has three biotypes—gravis, intermedius, and
mitis. The most severe disease is associated with the gravis
biotype, but any strain may produce toxin. All isolates of C.
diphtheriae should be tested by the laboratory for toxigenicity.
Pathogenesis
Susceptible persons may acquire toxigenic diphtheria bacilli in
the nasopharynx. The organism produces a toxin that inhibits
cellular protein synthesis and is responsible for local tissue
destruction and membrane formation. The toxin produced at
the site of the membrane is absorbed into the bloodstream
and then distributed to the tissues of the body. The toxin is
responsible for the major complications of myocarditis and
neuritis and can also cause low platelet counts (thrombocy-
topenia) and protein in the urine (proteinuria).
Clinical disease associated with non-toxin-producing strains
is generally milder. While rare severe cases have been
reported, these may actually have been caused by toxigenic
strains that were not detected because of inadequate culture
sampling.
Diphtheria Clinical Features
Clinical Features
The incubation period of diphtheria is 2-5 days (range, 1-10
days).
• Incubation period 2-5 days
(range, 1-10 days)
• May involve any mucous membrane
• Classified based on site of infection
-anterior nasal
-pharyngeal and tonsillar
-laryngeal
-cutaneous
-ocular
-genital
Disease can involve almost any mucous membrane. For
clinical purposes, it is convenient to classify diphtheria into a
number of manifestations, depending on the site of disease.
75


## p. 76 (#90) ##############################################

Diphtheria
Anterior Nasal Diphtheria
The onset of anterior nasal diphtheria is indistinguishable
from that of the common cold and is usually characterized
by a mucopurulent nasal discharge (containing both mucus
and pus) which may become blood-tinged. A white membrane
usually forms on the nasal septum. The disease is usually
fairly mild because of apparent poor systemic absorption of
toxin in this location, and it can be terminated rapidly by
antitoxin and antibiotic therapy.
16
Pharyngeal and Tonsillar Diphtheria
• Insidious onset of exudative
pharyngitis
• Exudate spreads within 2-3 days
and may form adherent
membrane
• Membrane may cause
respiratory obstruction
• Fever usually not high but
patient appears toxic
Pharyngeal and Tonsillar Diphtheria
The most common sites of diphtheria infection are the
pharynx and the tonsils. Infection at these sites is usually
associated with substantial systemic absorption of toxin. The
onset of pharyngitis is insidious. Early symptoms include
malaise, sore throat, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Within
2–3 days, a bluish-white membrane forms and extends,
varying in size from covering a small patch on the tonsils
to covering most of the soft palate. Often by the time a
physician is contacted, the membrane is greyish-green, or
black if bleeding has occurred. There is a minimal amount
of mucosal erythema surrounding the membrane. The
membrane is adherent to the tissue, and forcible attempts
to remove it cause bleeding. Extensive membrane formation
may result in respiratory obstruction.
The patient may recover at this point; or if enough toxin is
absorbed, develop severe prostration, striking pallor, rapid
pulse, stupor, and coma, and may even die within 6 to 10
days. Fever is usually not high, even though the patient may
appear quite toxic. Patients with severe disease may develop
marked edema of the submandibular areas and the anterior
neck along with lymphadenopathy, giving a characteristic
“bullneck" appearance.
Laryngeal Diphtheria
Laryngeal diphtheria can be either an extension of the
pharyngeal form or can only involve this site. Symptoms
include fever, hoarseness, and a barking cough. The membrane
can lead to airway obstruction, coma, and death.
Cutaneous (Skin) Diphtheria
In the United States, cutaneous diphtheria has been most
often associated with homeless persons. Skin infections are
quite common in the tropics and are probably responsible
for the high levels of natural immunity found in these popu-
lations. Skin infections may be manifested by a scaling rash
or by ulcers with clearly demarcated edges and membrane,
but any chronic skin lesion may harbor C diphtheriae along
with other organisms. Generally, the organisms isolated

Diphtheria
from recent cases in the United States were nontoxigenic.
The severity of the skin disease with toxigenic strains
appears to be less than in other forms of infection with
toxigenic strains. Skin diseases associated with nontoxigenic
strains are no longer reported to the National Notifiable
Diseases Surveillance System in the United States.
61
Other sites of involvement include the mucous membranes
of the conjunctiva and vulvovaginal area, as well as the
external auditory canal.
Diphtheria Complications
Complications
Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are
attributable to effects of the toxin. The severity of the
disease and complications are generally related to the extent
of local disease. The toxin, when absorbed, affects organs
and tissues distant from the site of invasion. The most
frequent complications of diphtheria are myocarditis and
neuritis.
• Most attributable to toxin
Severity generally related to
extent of local disease
• Most common complications
are myocarditis and neuritis
• Death occurs in 5%-10%
Myocarditis may present as abnormal cardiac rhythms and
can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later,
and can lead to heart failure. If myocarditis occurs early, it
is often fatal.
Neuritis most often affects motor nerves and usually
resolves completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is most
frequent during the third week of illness. Paralysis of eye
muscles, limbs, and diaphragm can occur after the fifth
week. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure may
result from diaphragmatic paralysis.
Other complications include otitis media and respiratory
insufficiency due to airway obstruction, especially in infants.
Death
The overall case-fatality rate for diphtheria is 5%-10%, with
higher death rates (up to 20%) among persons younger than
5 and older than 40 years of age. The case-fatality rate for
diphtheria has changed very little during the last 50 years.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Diagnosis of diphtheria is usually made on the basis of
clinical presentation since it is imperative to begin presump-
tive therapy quickly.
Culture of the lesion is done to confirm the diagnosis. It is
critical to take a swab of the pharyngeal area, especially any
discolored areas, ulcerations, and tonsillar crypts. Culture
medium containing tellurite is preferred because it provides
a selective advantage for the growth of this organism.
77


## p. 78 (#92) ##############################################

Diphtheria
A blood agar plate is also inoculated for detection of hemo-
lytic streptococcus. If diphtheria bacilli are isolated, they
must be tested for toxin production.
6
Gram stain and Kenyon stain of material from the
membrane itself can be helpful when trying to confirm
the clinical diagnosis. The Gram stain may show multiple
club-shaped forms that look like Chinese characters. Other
Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids) that can normally
inhabit the throat may confuse the interpretation of direct
stain. However, treatment should be started if clinical
diphtheria is suggested, even in the absence of a diagnostic
Gram stain.
In the event that prior antibiotic therapy may have impeded
a positive culture in a suspect diphtheria case, two sources
of evidence can aid in presumptive diagnosis: 1) isolation
of C. diphtheriae from cultures of specimens from close
contacts, or 2) a low nonprotective diphtheria antibody
titer (less than 0.1 IU) in serum obtained prior to antitoxin
administration. This is done by commercial laboratories and
requires several days. To isolate C. diphtheriae from carriers,
it is best to inoculate a Löffler or Pai slant with the throat
swab. After an incubation period of 18–24 hours, growth
from the slant is used to inoculate a medium containing
tellurite.
Medical Management
Diphtheria Antitoxin
• Produced in horses
• First used in the U.S. in 1891
• Used only for treatment of
diphtheria
• Neutralizes only unbound toxin
Diphtheria Antitoxin
Diphtheria antitoxin, produced in horses, was first used
in the United States in 1891. It is no longer indicated for
prophylaxis of contacts of diphtheria patients, only for the
treatment of diphtheria. Since 1997, diphtheria antitoxin
has been available only from CDC, and only through an
Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol.
Antitoxin will not neutralize toxin that is already fixed to
tissues, but it will neutralize circulating (unbound) toxin and
will prevent progression of disease. The patient must be
tested for sensitivity before antitoxin is given. Consultation
on the use of diphtheria antitoxin is available through the
duty officer at the CDC through CDC's Emergency Operations
Center at 770-488-7100.
Persons with suspected diphtheria should be given anti-
biotics and antitoxin in adequate dosage and placed in
isolation after the provisional clinical diagnosis is made and
appropriate cultures are obtained. Respiratory support and
airway maintenance should also be administered as needed.

## p. 79 (#93) ##############################################

Diphtheria
Antibiotics
Treatment with erythromycin orally or by injection (40
mg/kg/day; maximum, 2 gm/day) for 14 days, or procaine
penicillin G daily, intramuscularly (300,000 U/day for
those weighing 10 kg or less, and 600,000 U/day for those
weighing more than 10 kg) for 14 days. The disease is
usually not contagious 48 hours after antibiotics are insti-
tuted. Elimination of the organism should be documented
by two consecutive negative cultures after therapy is
completed.
6
Preventive Measures
For close contacts, especially household contacts, a
diphtheria booster, appropriate for age, should be given.
Contacts should also receive antibiotics-benzathine
penicillin G (600,000 units for persons younger than 6 years
old and 1,200,000 units for those 6 years old and older) or a
7- to 10-day course of oral erythromycin, (40 mg/kg/day for
children and 1 g/day for adults). For compliance reasons, if
surveillance of contacts cannot be maintained, they should
receive benzathine penicillin G. Identified carriers in the
community should also receive antibiotics. Maintain close
surveillance and begin antitoxin at the first signs of illness.
Contacts of cutaneous diphtheria should be treated as
described above; however, if the strain is shown to be
nontoxigenic, investigation of contacts can be discontinued.
Epidemiology
Diphtheria Epidemiology
• Reservoir
Occurrence
Diphtheria occurs worldwide, but clinical cases are more
prevalent in temperate zones. In the United States during
the pretoxoid era, the highest incidence was in the
Southeast during the winter. More recently, highest inci-
dence rates have been in states with significant populations
of Native Americans. No geographic concentration of cases
is currently observed in the United States.
Human carriers
Usually asymptomatic
• Transmission
Respiratory
Skin and fomites rarely
Temporal pattern
Winter and spring
• Communicability
Up to several weeks
without antibiotics
Reservoir
Human carriers are the reservoir for C. diphtheriae and are
usually asymptomatic. In outbreaks, high percentages of
children are found to be transient carriers.
Transmission
Transmission is most often person-to-person spread from
the respiratory tract. Rarely, transmission may occur from
skin lesions or articles soiled with discharges from lesions of
infected persons (fomites).
79


## p. 80 (#94) ##############################################

Diphtheria
Temporal Pattern
In temperate areas, diphtheria most frequently occurs
during winter and spring.
16
Communicability
Transmission may occur as long as virulent bacilli are
present in discharges and lesions. The time is variable, but
organisms usually persist 2 weeks or less, and seldom more
than 4 weeks, without antibiotics. Chronic carriers may shed
organisms for 6 months or more. Effective antibiotic therapy
promptly terminates shedding.
Diphtheria - United States, 1940-2009
Secular Trends in the United States
Diphtheria was once a major cause of morbidity and
mortality among children. In England and Wales during the
1930s, diphtheria was among the top three causes of death
for children younger than 15 years of age.

In the 1920s in the United States, 100,000–200,000 cases
of diphtheria (140–150 cases per 100,000 population) and
13,000–15,000 deaths were reported each year. In 1921, a
total of 206,000 cases and 15,520 deaths were reported. The
number of cases gradually declined to about 19,000 cases
in 1945 (15 per 100,000 population). A more rapid decrease
began with the widespread use of toxoid in the late 1940s.
Year
From 1970 to 1979, an average of 196 cases per year were
reported. This included a high proportion of cutaneous
cases from an outbreak in Washington State. Beginning
in 1980, all cases with nontoxigenic cutaneous isolates
were excluded from reporting. Diphtheria was seen most
frequently in Native Americans and persons in lower socio-
economic strata.
Diphtheria - United States, 1980-2009
From 1980 through 2004, 57 cases of diphtheria were reported
in the United States, an average of 2 or 3 per year (range, 0–5
cases per year). Only 5 cases have been reported since 2000.

Diphtheria
None of the infected persons had classic diphtheria disease,
although five had either pharyngitis or tonsillitis. The
presence of toxigenic C. diphtheriae in this community is
a good reminder for providers not to let down their guard
against this organism.
6
Diphtheria continues to occur in other parts of the world.
A major epidemic of diphtheria occurred in countries of
the former Soviet Union beginning in 1990. By 1994, the
epidemic had affected all 15 Newly Independent States
(NIS). More than 157,000 cases and more than 5,000 deaths
were reported. In the 6 years from 1990 through 1995, the
NIS accounted for more than 90% of all diphtheria cases
reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from
the entire world. In some NIS countries, up to 80% of the
epidemic diphtheria cases have been among adults. The
outbreak and the age distribution of cases are believed to
be due to several factors, including a lack of routine immu-
nization of adults in these countries. A total of 7,088 cases
of diphtheria was reported to WHO in 2008.
Diphtheria Toxoid
Characteristics
Beginning in the early 1900s, prophylaxis was attempted
with toxin-antitoxin mixtures. Toxoid was developed
around 1921 but was not widely used until the early 1930s.
It was incorporated with tetanus toxoid and pertussis
vaccine and became routinely used in the 1940s.
Diphtheria toxoid is produced by growing toxigenic C.
diphtheriae in liquid medium. The filtrate is incubated
with formaldehyde to convert toxin to toxoid and is then
adsorbed onto an aluminum salt.

Diphtheria toxoid is available combined with tetanus
toxoid as pediatric diphtheria-tetanus toxoid (DT) or adult
tetanus-diphtheria (Td), and with both tetanus toxoid and
acellular pertussis vaccine as DTP and Tdap. Diphtheria
toxoid is also available as combined DTP-HepB-IPV
(Pediarix) and DTAP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel)—see Pertussis
chapter for more information. Pediatric formulations (DT
and DTP) contain a similar amount of tetanus toxoid as
adult Td, but contain 3 to 4 times as much diphtheria
toxoid. Children younger than 7 years of age should receive
either DTP or pediatric DT. Persons 7 years of age or older
should receive the adult formulation (adult Td), even if
they have not completed a series of DTap or pediatric DT.
Two brands of Tdap are available-Boostrix (approved for
persons 10 through 64 years of age) and Adacel (approved
for persons 11 through 64 years of age). DTP and Tdap
vaccines do not contain thimerosal as a preservative.

Diphtheria
Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy
After a primary series of three properly spaced diphtheria
toxoid doses in adults or four doses in infants, a protective
level of antitoxin (defined as greater than 0.1 IU of antitoxin/
ml) is reached in more than 95%. Diphtheria toxoid has
been estimated to have a clinical efficacy of 97%.

Vaccination Schedule and Use
DTap (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis
vaccine) is the vaccine of choice for children 6 weeks through
6 years of age. The usual schedule is a primary series of 4
doses at 2,4,6, and 15–18 months of age. The first, second,
and third doses of DTP should be separated by a minimum
of 4 weeks. The fourth dose should follow the third dose
by no less than 6 months, and should not be administered
before 12 months of age.
4 weeks

Children Who Receive DT
The number of doses of DT needed to
complete the series depends on the
child's age at the first dose:
- if first dose given at younger than
12 months of age, 4 doses are
recommended
-if first dose given at 12 months or
older, 3 doses complete the primary
series
If a child has a valid contraindication to pertussis vaccine,
pediatric DT should be used to complete the vaccination
series. If the child was younger than 12 months old when
the first dose of DT was administered (as DTP, DTP, or DT),
the child should receive a total of four primary DT doses. If
the child was 12 months of age or older at the time the first
dose of DT was administered, three doses (third dose 6–12
months after the second) completes the primary DT series.
Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis
Booster Doses
If the fourth dose of DT, DTP or DTP is administered
before the fourth birthday, a booster (fifth) dose is recom-
mended at 4 through 6 years of age. The fifth dose is not
required if the fourth dose was given on or after the fourth
birthday.
• 4-6 years of age, before entering
school (DTP)
• 11-12 years of age (Tdap)
• Every 10 years thereafter (Td)
Because of waning antitoxin titers, most persons have
antitoxin levels below the optimal level 10 years after the
last dose. Tetanus toxoid should be given with diphtheria
toxoid as Td every 10 years. The first booster dose may be
given at 11 or 12 years of age. ACIP recommends this dose
be administered as Tdap. If a dose is given sooner as part
of wound management, the next booster is not needed
for 10 years thereafter. More frequent boosters are not
indicated and have been reported to result in an increased
incidence and severity of local adverse reactions.

Td is the vaccine of choice for children 7 years and older
and for adults. A primary series is three or four doses,
depending on whether the person has received prior doses
of diphtheria-containing vaccine and the age these doses
were administered. The number of doses recommended for
children who received one or more doses of DTP, DTP, or
DT before age 7 years is discussed above. For unvaccinated

document prior vaccination), the primary series is three
doses. The first two doses should be separated by at least
4 weeks, and the third dose given 6 to 12 months after the
second. ACIP recommends that one of these doses (prefer-
ably the first) be administered as Tdap. A booster dose of
Td should be given every 10 years. Tdap is approved for a
single dose at this time (i.e., it should not be used for all the
doses of Td in a previously unvaccinated person 7 years or
older). Refer to the pertussis chapter for more information
about Tdap.

Interruption of the recommended schedule or delay of
subsequent doses does not reduce the response to the
vaccine when the series is finally completed. There is no
need to restart a series regardless of the time elapsed
between doses.

Diphtheria disease might not confer immunity. Persons
recovering from diphtheria should begin or complete active
immunization with diphtheria toxoid during convalescence.

Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Persons with a history of a severe allergic reaction (anaphy-
laxis) to a vaccine component or following a prior dose
should not receive additional doses of diphtheria toxoid.
Diphtheria toxoid should be deferred for those persons who
have moderate or severe acute illness, but persons with
minor illness may be vaccinated. Immunosuppression and
pregnancy are not contraindications to receiving diphtheria
toxoid. See pertussis chapter for additional information on
contraindications and precautions to Tdap.

Adverse Reactions
Adverse Reactions Following
Vaccination
Local reactions, generally erythema and induration with or
without tenderness, are common after the administration
of vaccines containing diphtheria toxoid. Local reactions
are usually self-limited and require no therapy. A nodule
may be palpable at the injection site for several weeks.
Abscess at the site of injection has been reported. Fever
and other systemic symptoms are not common.
• Local reactions (erythema,
induration)
• Fever and systemic symptoms
not common
• Exaggerated local reactions
(Arthus-type)
• Severe systemic reactions rare
Exaggerated local (Arthus-type) reactions are occasion-
ally reported following receipt of a diphtheria- or
tetanus-containing vaccine. These reactions present as
extensive painful swelling, often from shoulder to elbow.
They generally begin 2–8 hours after injections and are
reported most often in adults, particularly those who have
received frequent doses of diphtheria or tetanus toxoid.
Persons experiencing these severe reactions usually have
very high serum antitoxin levels; they should not be given

further routine or emergency booster doses of Td more
frequently than every 10 years. Less severe local reactions
may occur in persons who have multiple prior boosters.
Rarely, severe systemic reactions such as generalized urti-
caria, anaphylaxis, or neurologic complications have been
reported following administration of diphtheria toxoid.
16
Vaccine Storage and Handling
All diphtheria-toxoid-containing vaccines should be stored
continuously at 350–46°F (20-8°C). Freezing reduces the
potency of the tetanus component. Vaccine exposed to
freezing temperature should never be administered.
Suspect Case Investigation and Control
Immediate action on all highly suspect cases (including cuta-
neous) is warranted until they are shown not to be caused
by toxigenic C. diphtheriae. The following action should also
be taken for any toxigenic C. diphtheriae carriers who are
detected.
1. Contact state health department or CDC.
2. Obtain appropriate cultures and preliminary clinical and
epidemiologic information (including vaccine history).
3. Begin early presumptive treatment with antibiotics and
antitoxin. Impose strict isolation until at least two cultures
are negative 24 hours after antibiotics were discontinued.
4. Identify close contacts, especially household members
and other persons directly exposed to oral secretions of
the patient. Culture all close contacts, regardless of their
immunization status. Ideally, culture should be from
both throat and nasal swabs. After culture, all contacts
should receive antibiotic prophylaxis. Inadequately
immunized contacts should receive DTP/DT/Td/Tdap
boosters. If fewer than three doses of diphtheria toxoid
have been given, or vaccination history is unknown, an
immediate dose of diphtheria toxoid should be given
and the primary series completed according to the
current schedule. If more than 5 years have elapsed since
administration of diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine, a
booster dose should be given. If the most recent dose was
within 5 years, no booster is required (see the ACIP's 1991
Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis: Recommendations for
Vaccine Use and Other Preventive Measures for schedule
for children younger than 7 years of age). Unimmunized
contacts should start a course of DTaP/DT/Td vaccine and
be monitored closely for symptoms of diphtheria for 7 days.
5. Treat any confirmed carrier with an adequate course of
antibiotic, and repeat cultures at a minimum of 2 weeks

to ensure eradication of the organism. Persons who
continue to harbor the organism after treatment with
either penicillin or erythromycin should receive an addi-
tional 10-day course of erythromycin and should submit
samples for follow-up cultures.
6. Treat any contact with antitoxin at the first sign of illness.

Haemophilus influenzae type b
Haemophilus influenzae type b
Haemophilus influenzae type b
Haemophilus influenzae is a cause of bacterial infections
that are often severe, particularly among infants. It was
first described by Pfeiffer in 1892. During an outbreak of
influenza he found the bacteria in sputum of patients and
proposed a causal association between this bacterium and
the clinical syndrome known as influenza. The organism
was given the name Haemophilus by Winslow, et al. in 1920.
It was not until 1933 that Smith, et al. established that
influenza was caused by a virus and that H. influenzae was a
cause of secondary infection.
• Severe bacterial infection,
particularly among infants
• During late 19th century believed to
cause influenza
• Immunology and microbiology
clarified in 1930s
In the 1930s, Margaret Pittman demonstrated that H.
influenzae could be isolated in encapsulated and unencap-
sulated forms. She identified six capsular types (a–f), and
observed that virtually all isolates from cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) and blood were of the capsular type b.
Before the introduction of effective vaccines, H. influenzae
type b (Hib) was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis
and other invasive bacterial disease among children younger
than 5 years of age; approximately one in 200 children in
this age group developed invasive Hib disease. Nearly all Hib
infections occurred among children younger than 5 years
of age, and approximately two-thirds of all cases occurred
among children younger than 18 months of age.
Haemophilus influenzae
Haemophilus influenzae
Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative coccobacillus. It
is generally aerobic but can grow as a facultative anaerobe.
In vitro growth requires accessory growth factors, including
“X” factor (hemin) and “V” factor (nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide [NAD]).
• Aerobic gram-negative bacteria
• Polysaccharide capsule
• Six different serotypes (a-f) of
polysaccharide capsule
• 95% of invasive disease caused
by type b
Chocolate agar media are used for isolation. H. influenzae
will generally not grow on blood agar, which lacks NAD.
The outermost structure of H. influenzae is composed of
polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate (PRP), a polysaccharide that
is responsible for virulence and immunity. Six antigenically
and biochemically distinct capsular polysaccharide serotypes
have been described; these are designated types a through f.
In the prevaccine era, type b organisms accounted for 95% of
all strains that caused invasive disease.
Pathogenesis
The organism enters the body through the nasopharynx.
Organisms colonize the nasopharynx and may remain only
transiently or for several months in the absence of symptoms
(asymptomatic carrier). In the prevaccine era, Hib could be

isolated from the nasopharynx of 0.5%-3% of normal infants
and children but was not common in adults. Nontypeable
(unencapsulated) strains are also frequent inhabitants of the
human respiratory tract.
In some persons, the organism causes an invasive infection.
The exact mode of invasion to the bloodstream is unknown.
Antecedent viral or mycoplasma infection of the upper respi-
ratory tract may be a contributing factor. The bacteria spread
in the bloodstream to distant sites in the body. Meninges are
especially likely to be affected.
The most striking feature of Hib disease is age-dependent
susceptibility. Hib disease is not common beyond 5 years
of age. Passive protection of some infants is provided by
transplacentally acquired maternal IgG antibodies and
breastfeeding during the first 6 months of life. In the
prevaccine era peak attack rates occurred at 6–7 months
of age, declining thereafter. The presumed reason for this
age distribution is the acquisition of immunity to Hib with
increasing age.
Antibodies to Hib capsular polysaccharide are protective.
The precise level of antibody required for protection against
invasive disease is not clearly established. However, a titer of
1 ug/mL 3 weeks postvaccination correlated with protection
in studies following vaccination with unconjugated purified
polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate (PRP) vaccine and suggested
long-term protection from invasive disease.
Acquisition of both anticapsular and serum bactericidal
antibody is inversely related to the age-specific incidence of
Hib disease.
In the prevaccine era, most children acquired immunity by
5–6 years of age through asymptomatic infection by Hib
bacteria. Since only a relatively small proportion of children
carry Hib at any time, it has been postulated that exposure
to organisms that share common antigenic structures with
the capsule of Hib (so-called “cross-reacting organisms”) may
also stimulate the development of anticapsular antibodies
against Hib. Natural exposure to Hib also induces antibodies
to outer membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharides, and other
antigens on the surface of the bacterium.
The genetic constitution of the host may also be important
in susceptibility to infection with Hib. Risk for Hib disease
has been associated with a number of genetic markers, but
the mechanism of these associations is unknown. No single
genetic relationship regulating susceptibility or immune
responses to polysaccharide antigens has yet been convinc-
ingly demonstrated.

Haemophilus influenzae type b
Clinical Features
Invasive disease caused by H. influenzae type b can affect
many organ systems. The most common types of invasive
disease are meningitis, epiglottitis, pneumonia, arthritis, and
cellulitis.

Meningitis is infection of the membranes covering the
brain and is the most common clinical manifestation of
invasive Hib disease, accounting for 50%-65% of cases in
the prevaccine era. Hallmarks of Hib meningitis are fever,
decreased mental status, and stiff neck (these symptoms also
occur with meningitis caused by other bacteria). Hearing
impairment or other neurologic sequelae occur in 15%-30%
of survivors. The case-fatality rate is 2%-5%, despite appro-
priate antimicrobial therapy.
*prevaccination era
Epiglottitis is an infection and swelling of the epiglottis,
the tissue in the throat that covers and protects the larynx
during swallowing. Epiglottitis may cause life-threatening
airway obstruction.

Meningitis
• Accounted for approximately
50%-65% of cases in the
prevaccine era
• Hearing impairment or neurologic
sequelae in 15%-30%
Case-fatality rate 2%-5% despite
appropriate antimicrobial therapy
Septic arthritis (joint infection), cellulitis (rapidly progressing
skin infection which usually involves face, head, or
neck), and pneumonia (which can be mild focal or severe
empyema) are common manifestations of invasive disease.
Osteomyelitis (bone infection) and pericarditis (infection
of the sac covering the heart) are less common forms of
invasive disease. Otitis media and acute bronchitis due to
H. influenzae are generally caused by nontypeable strains.
Hib strains account for only 5%-10% of H. influenzae causing
otitis media.
Nontypeable (unencapsulated) strains may cause invasive
disease but are generally less virulent than encapsulated
strains. Nontypeable strains are rare causes of serious
infection among children but are a common cause of ear
infections in children and bronchitis in adults.
Laboratory Diagnosis
A Gram stain of an infected body fluid may demonstrate
small gram-negative coccobacilli suggestive of invasive
Haemophilus disease. CSF, blood, pleural fluid, joint fluid,
and middle ear aspirates should be cultured on appropriate
media. A positive culture for H. influenzae establishes the
diagnosis.
All isolates of H. influenzae should be serotyped. This is an
extremely important laboratory procedure that should be
performed on every isolate of H. influenzae, especially those
obtained from children younger than 15 years of age. This
test determines whether an isolate is type b, which is the
only type that is potentially vaccine preventable. Serotyping

is usually done by either the state health department labora-
tory or a reference laboratory.
Antigen detection may be used as an adjunct to culture,
particularly in diagnosing H. influenzae infection in patients
who have been partially treated with antimicrobial agents, in
which case the organism may not be viable on culture. Two
tests are available. Latex agglutination is a rapid, sensitive,
and specific method to detect Hib capsular polysaccharide
antigen in CSF, but a negative test does not exclude the
diagnosis, and false-positive tests have been reported.
Antigen testing of serum and urine is not recommended.
Counterimmunoelectrophoresis is similar to latex agglutina-
tion but is less sensitive, takes longer, and is more difficult to
perform.
Haemophilus influenzae type b
Medical Management
• Hospitalization required
• Treatment with an effective 3rd
generation cephalosporin, or
chloramphenicol plus ampicillin

Medical Management
Hospitalization is generally required for invasive Hib
disease. Antimicrobial therapy with an effective third-
generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), or
chloramphenicol in combination with ampicillin should
be begun immediately. The treatment course is usually 10
days. Ampicillin-resistant strains of Hib are now common
throughout the United States. Children with life-threatening
illness in which Hib may be the etiologic agent should not
receive ampicillin alone as initial empiric therapy.
.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Hib disease occurs worldwide.
Haemophilus influenzae type b
Epidemiology
• Reservoir
Human
Asymptomatic carriers
• Transmission
Respiratory droplets
Reservoir
Humans (asymptomatic carriers) are the only known reser-
voir. Hib does not survive in the environment on inanimate
surfaces.
• Temporal pattern
Peaks in Sept-Dec
and March-May
• Communicability Generally limited but
higher in some
circumstances
Transmission
The primary mode of Hib transmission is presumably by
respiratory droplet spread, although firm evidence for this
mechanism is lacking.
Temporal Pattern
Several studies in the prevaccine era described a bimodal
seasonal pattern in the United States, with one peak during
September through December and a second peak during
March through May. The reason for this bimodal pattern is
not known.

Communicability
The contagious potential of invasive Hib disease is consid-
ered to be limited. However, certain circumstances, particu-
larly close contact with a case-patient (e.g., household, child
care, or institutional setting) can lead to outbreaks or direct
secondary transmission of the disease.

Before the availability of national reporting data, several
areas conducted active surveillance for H. influenzae disease,
which allowed estimates of disease nationwide. In the early
1980s, it was estimated that about 20,000 cases occurred
annually in the United States, primarily among children
younger than 5 years of age (40–50 cases per 100,000
population). The incidence of invasive Hib disease began
to decline dramatically in the late 1980s, coincident with
licensure of conjugate Hib vaccines, and has declined by
more than 99% compared with the prevaccine era.

Incidence is strikingly age-dependent. In the prevaccine

• Most recent cases in unvaccinated

children
In 1998–2000, approximately 44% of children younger than 5
years of age with confirmed invasive Hib disease were younger
than 6 months of age and too young to have completed a
three-dose primary vaccination series. Fifty-six percent were
age 6 months or older and were eligible to have completed
the primary vaccination series. Of these age-eligible children,
68% were either incompletely vaccinated (fewer than 3 doses)
or their vaccination status was unknown. Thirty-two percent
of children aged 6-59 months with confirmed type b disease
had received three or more doses of Hib vaccine, including
22 who had received a booster dose 14 or more days before
onset of their illness. The cause of Hib vaccine failure in these
children is not known.

Haemophilus influenzae type b
In 2009, among children younger than 5 years of age, 35
cases of invasive disease due to Hib were reported in the
United States. In addition, another 178 cases caused by
unknown H. influenzae serotypes were reported, so the
actual number of Hib cases could be between 35 and 213.
Most cases were among unvaccinated or incompletely vacci-
nated children.
Haemophilus influenzae type b
Risk Factors for Invasive Disease
• Exposure factors
-household crowding
-large household size
-child care attendance
-low socioeconomic status
-low parental education
-school-aged siblings
• Host factors
-racelethnicity
-chronic disease
Risk factors for Hib disease include exposure factors and
host factors that increase the likelihood of exposure to Hib.
Exposure factors include household crowding, large house-
hold size, child care attendance, low socioeconomic status,
low parental education levels, and school-aged siblings.
Host factors include race/ethnicity (elevated risk among
African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans—possibly
confounded by socioeconomic variables that are associated
with both race/ethnicity and Hib disease), chronic disease
(e.g., sickle cell anemia, antibody deficiency syndromes,
malignancies, especially during chemotherapy), and possibly
gender (risk is higher for males).
Protective factors (effect limited to infants younger than 6
months of age) include breastfeeding and passively acquired
maternal antibody.
Secondary Hib disease is defined as illness occurring 1-60
days following contact with an ill child, and accounts for
less than 5% of all invasive Hib disease. Among household
contacts, six studies have found a secondary attack rate
of 0.3% in the month following onset of the index case,
which is about 600-fold higher than the risk for the general
population. Attack rates varied substantially with age, from
3.7% among children 2 years of age and younger to 0%
among contacts 6 years of age and older. In these household
contacts, 64% of secondary cases occurred within the first
week (excluding the first 24 hours) of disease onset in the
index patient, 20% during the second week, and 16% during
the third and fourth weeks.
Data are conflicting regarding the risk of secondary transmis-
sion among child care contacts. Secondary attack rates have
varied from 0% to as high as 2.7%. Most studies seem to
suggest that child care contacts are at relatively low risk for
secondary transmission of Hib disease particularly if contacts
are age-appropriately vaccinated.

Characteristics
A pure polysaccharide vaccine (HbPV) was licensed in

than nonvaccinees). HbPV was used until 1988 but is no
longer available in the United States.
Polysaccharide Vaccines
The characteristics of the Hib polysaccharide were similar
to other polysaccharide vaccines (e.g., pneumococcal,
meningococcal). The response to the vaccine was typical of
a T-independent antigen, most notably an age-dependent
immune response, and poor immunogenicity in children 2
years of age and younger. In addition, no boost in antibody
titer was observed with repeated doses, the antibody that
was produced was relatively low-affinity IgM, and switching
to IgG production was minimal.
• Age-related immune response
• Not consistently immunogenic in
children 2 years of age and
younger
• No booster response
• Antibody with less functional
activity
Haemophilus influenzae type b Polysaccharide-
Protein Conjugate Vaccines
Conjugation is the process of chemically bonding a polysac-
charide (a somewhat ineffective antigen) to a protein
"carrier,” which is a more effective antigen. This process
changes the polysaccharide from a T-independent to a
T-dependent antigen and greatly improves immunogenicity,
particularly in young children. In addition, repeat doses of
Hib conjugate vaccines elicit booster responses and allow
maturation of class-specific immunity with predominance of
IgG antibody. The Hib conjugates also cause carrier priming
and elicit antibody to “useful” carrier protein.
Polysaccharide Conjugate
Vaccines
• Stimulates T-dependent immunity
• Enhanced antibody production,
especially in young children
• Repeat doses elicit booster
response
The first Hib conjugate vaccine (PRP-D, ProHIBIT) was
licensed in December 1987. PRP-D is no longer available in
the United States. HibTITER (HbOC) is also no longer avail-
able.
Two conjugate Hib vaccines are licensed for use in infants
as young as 6 weeks of age (see below). A third Hib vaccine
(Hiberix) is approved only for the last dose of the Hib
schedule among children 12 months and older. The vaccines
utilize different carrier proteins. Two combination vaccines
that contain Hib conjugate vaccine are also available.

Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy
Hib conjugate vaccines licensed for use in infants are highly
immunogenic. More than 95% of infants will develop protec-
tive antibody levels after a primary series of two or three
doses. Clinical efficacy has been estimated at 95% to 100%.
Invasive Hib disease in a completely vaccinated infant is
uncommon.

## p. 94 (#108) #############################################

Haemophilus influenzae type b
Hib vaccine is immunogenic in patients with increased risk
for invasive disease, such as those with sickle-cell disease,
leukemia, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,
and those who have had a splenectomy. However, in persons
with HIV infection, immunogenicity varies with stage of
infection and degree of immunocompromise. Efficacy studies
have not been performed in populations with increased risk
of invasive disease.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
All infants, including those born prematurely, should receive
a primary series of conjugate Hib vaccine (separate or in
combination), beginning at 2 months of age. The number of
doses in the primary series depends on the type of vaccine
used. A primary series of PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB) vaccine is
two doses; PRP-T (ACTHIB) requires a three-dose primary
series (see table below). A booster is recommended at 12–15
months regardless of which vaccine is used for the primary
series.

With the exception of Hiberix, the conjugate Hib vaccines
licensed for use in infants are interchangeable. A series

Vaccination Following Invasive Disease
Hib invasive disease does not always result in development
of protective anti-PRP antibody levels. Children younger than
24 months of age who develop invasive Hib disease should
be considered susceptible and should receive Hib vaccine.
Vaccination of these children should start as soon as possible
during the convalescent phase of the illness. The schedule
should be completed as recommended for the child's age.

Vaccination of Older Children and Adults
In general, Hib vaccination of persons older than 59 months
of age is not recommended. The majority of older children
are immune to Hib, probably from asymptomatic infec-
tion as infants. However, some older children and adults
are at increased risk for invasive Hib disease and may be
vaccinated if they were not vaccinated in childhood. These
include those with functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g.,
sickle cell disease, postsplenectomy), immunodeficiency (in
particular, persons with IgG2 subclass deficiency), immuno-
suppression from cancer chemotherapy, infection with HIV,
and receipt of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).
Previously unvaccinated persons older than 59 months of
age with one of these high-risk conditions should be given at
least one pediatric dose of any Hib conjugate vaccine.

Combination Vaccines
Containing Hib
• DTAP-IPV/Hib
-Pentacel
• Hepatitis B-Hib
-Comvax
Combination Vaccines
Two combination vaccines that contain H. influenzae type b
are available in the United States-DTAP-IPV-Hib (Pentacel,
sanofi pasteur) and hepatitis B-Hib (Comvax, Merck). A third
combination, TriHiBit, is no longer available in the U.S.
COMVAX
• Hib-Hep B combination
• Use when either antigen is indicated
• Cannot use before 6 weeks of age
. May be used in infants whose
mothers are HBsAg positive or
status is unknown
Comvax
Comvax (Merck) is a combination hepatitis B-Hib vaccine,
licensed in October 1996. The vaccine contains a standard
dose of PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB), and 5 mcg (pediatric dose)
of Merck's hepatitis B vaccine. Comvax is licensed for use
when either or both antigens are indicated. However,
because of the potential of immune tolerance to the Hib
antigen, Comvax should not be used in infants younger
than 6 weeks of age (i.e., the birth dose of hepatitis B,
or a dose at 1 month of age, if the infant is on a 0-1-6-
month schedule). Comvax is not licensed for infants whose
mothers are known to be hepatitis B surface antigen
positive (i.e., acute or chronic infection with hepatitis
B virus). However, the vaccine contains the same dose
of Merck's hepatitis B vaccine recommended for these
infants, so response to the hepatitis B component of
Comvax should be adequate. The Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) has approved off-label use
of Comvax in children whose mother is HBsAg positive or
whose HBsAg status is unknown. See

Recommendations for spacing and timing of Comvax are the
same as those for the individual antigens. In particular, the
third dose must be given at 12 months of age or older and at
least 2 months after the second dose, as recommended for
PRP-OMP.
Pentacel
Pentacel (sanofi pasteur) is a combination vaccine that
contains lyophilized Hib (ActHIB) vaccine that is reconstituted
with a liquid DTAP-IPV solution. The vaccine was licensed
by FDA in June 2008. Pentacel is licensed by FDA for doses
1 through 4 of the DTP series among children 6 weeks
through 4 years of age. Pentacel should not be used for the
fifth dose of the DTP series, or for children 5 years or older
regardless of the number of prior doses of the component
vaccines.
Pentacel Vaccine
• Contains lyophilized Hib (ActHIB)
vaccine that is reconstituted with a
liquid DTAP-IPV solution
• Approved for doses 1 through 4
among children 6 weeks through 4
years of age
• The DTAP-IPV solution should not be
used separately (i.e., only use to
reconstitute thé Hib component)
The DTAP-IPV solution is licensed only for use as the diluent
for the lyophilized Hib component and should not be
used separately. If the DTAP-IPV solution is inadvertently
administered without being used to reconstitute the Hib
component the DTap and IPV doses can be counted as valid.
However, PRP-T (ActHib) must be reconstituted only with the
DTaP-IPV diluent supplied in the Pentacel package, or with
a specific 0.4% sodium chloride ActHib diluent. If DTAP-IPV
diluent is not available then the provider must contact the
manufacturer (sanofi pasteur) to obtain the ActHib diluent.
Any dose of ActHib reconstituted with a diluent other than
DTAP-IPV or specific ActHib diluent should not be counted as
valid and must be repeated.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Vaccination with Hib conjugate vaccine is contraindicated for
persons known to have experienced a severe allergic reaction
(anaphylaxis) to a vaccine component or following a prior dose
of that vaccine. Vaccination should be delayed for children
with moderate or severe acute illnesses. Minor illnesses (e.g.,
mild upper respiratory infection) are not contraindications to
vaccination. Hib conjugate vaccines are contraindicated for
children younger than 6 weeks of age because of the potential
for development of immunologic tolerance.

Vaccine Storage and Handling
All Hib conjugate vaccines should be shipped in insulated
containers to prevent freezing. Unreconstituted or liquid
vaccine should be stored at refrigerator temperature
(35°46°F 12°–8°C]). Hib vaccine must not be frozen.
ActHIB should be used within 24 hours of reconstitution.
Surveillance and Reporting of Hib

Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A
The first descriptions of hepatitis (epidemic jaundice)
are generally attributed to Hippocrates. Outbreaks of
jaundice, probably hepatitis A, were reported in the
17th and 18th centuries, particularly in association with
military campaigns. Hepatitis A (formerly called infectious
hepatitis) was first differentiated epidemiologically from
hepatitis B, which has a long incubation period, in the
1940s. Development of serologic tests allowed definitive
diagnosis of hepatitis B. In the 1970s, identification of the
virus, and development of serologic tests helped differen-
tiate hepatitis A from other types of non-B hepatitis.

Until 2004, hepatitis A was the most frequently reported
type of hepatitis in the United States. In the prevaccine era,
the primary methods used for preventing hepatitis A were
hygienic measures and passive protection with immune
globulin (IG). Hepatitis A vaccines were licensed in 1995 and
1996. These vaccines provide long-term protection against
hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. The similarities between
the epidemiology of hepatitis A and poliomyelitis suggest
that widespread vaccination of appropriate susceptible
populations can substantially lower disease incidence,
eliminate virus transmission, and ultimately, eliminate HAV
infection.
Hepatitis A Virus
Hepatitis A Virus
Hepatitis A is caused by infection with HAV, a nonenvel-
oped RNA virus that is classified as a picornavirus. It was
first isolated in 1979. Humans are the only natural host,
although several nonhuman primates have been infected in
laboratory conditions. Depending on conditions, HAV can be
stable in the environment for months. The virus is relatively
stable at low pH levels and moderate temperatures but can
be inactivated by high temperature (185°F (85°C] or higher),
formalin, and chlorine.
• Picornavirus (RNA)
• Humans are only natural host
• Stable at low pH
• Inactivated by high temperature
(185°F or higher), formalin,

Hepatitis A Pathogenesis
Pathogenesis
HAV is acquired by mouth (through fecal-oral transmis-
sion) and replicates in the liver. After 10–12 days, virus
is present in blood and is excreted via the biliary system
into the feces. Peak titers occur during the 2 weeks before
onset of illness. Although virus is present in serum, its
concentration is several orders of magnitude less than
in feces. Virus excretion begins to decline at the onset of
clinical illness, and has decreased significantly by 7-10
days after onset of symptoms. Most infected persons no
longer excrete virus in the feces by the third week of
illness. Children may excrete virus longer than adults.
• Entry into mouth
• Viral replication in the liver
• Virus present in blood and feces
10-12 days after infection
• Virus excretion may continue for
up to 3 weeks after onset of
symptoms

Hepatitis A
Hepatitis A Clinical Features
• Incubation period 28 days
(range 15-50 days)
• Illness not specific for hepatitis A
• Likelihood of symptomatic illness
directly related to age
• Children generally asymptomatic,
adults symptomatic
Clinical Features
The incubation period of hepatitis A is approximately 28
days (range 15–50 days). The clinical course of acute hepa-
titis A is indistinguishable from that of other types of acute
viral hepatitis. The illness typically has an abrupt onset of
fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort,
dark urine and jaundice. Clinical illness usually does not
last longer than 2 months, although 10%-15% of persons
have prolonged or relapsing signs and symptoms for up to
6 months. Virus may be excreted during a relapse.
.8
The likelihood of symptomatic illness from HAV infection
is directly related to age. In children younger than 6 years
of age, most (70%) infections are asymptomatic. In older
children and adults, infection is usually symptomatic, with
jaundice occurring in more than 70% of patients. HAV
infection occasionally produces fulminant hepatitis A.
Complications
In the prevaccine era, fulminant hepatitis A caused about
100 deaths per year in the United States. The case-fatality
rate among persons of all ages with reported cases was
approximately 0.3% but could be higher among older
persons (approximately 2% among persons 40 years of age
and older).
Hepatitis A results in substantial morbidity, with associated
costs caused by medical care and work loss. Hospitalization
rates for hepatitis A are 11%–22%. Adults who become ill
lose an average of 27 work days per illness, and health
departments incur the costs of postexposure prophylaxis
for an average of 11 contacts per case. Average direct and
indirect costs of hepatitis A range from $1,817 to $2,459 per
adult case and $433 to $1,492 per pediatric case. In 1989,
the estimated annual U.S. total cost of hepatitis A was more
than $200 million.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Hepatitis A cannot be distinguished from other types of
viral hepatitis on the basis of clinical or epidemiologic
features alone. Serologic testing is required to confirm
the diagnosis. Virtually all patients with acute hepatitis
A have detectable IgM anti-HAV. Acute HAV infection is
confirmed during the acute or early convalescent phase of
infection by the presence of IgM anti-HAV in serum. IgM
generally becomes detectable 5–10 days before the onset
of symptoms and can persist for up to 6 months.
IgG anti-HAV appears in the convalescent phase of infec-
tion, remains present in serum for the lifetime of the
person, and confers enduring protection against disease.
102


## p. 103 (#117) ############################################

Hepatitis A
The antibody test for total anti-HAV measures both IgG
anti-HAV and IgM anti-HAV. Persons who are total anti-HAV
positive and IgM anti-HAV negative have serologic markers
indicating immunity consistent with either past infection
or vaccination.
Molecular virology methods such as polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-based assays can be used to amplify and
sequence viral genomes. These assays are helpful to investi-
gate common-source outbreaks of hepatitis A. Providers with
questions about molecular virology methods should consult
with their state health department or the CDC Division of
Viral Hepatitis.

Medical Management
There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A virus infec-
tion. Treatment and management of HAV infection are
supportive.
Epidemiology

Occurrence
Hepatitis A occurs throughout the world. It is highly endemic
in some areas, particularly Central and South America,
Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and the Western Pacific.
• Reservoir
Human
• Transmission
Fecal-oral
• Temporal pattern None
• Communicability 2 weeks before to
1 week after onset
Reservoir
Humans are the only natural reservoir of the virus. There
are no insect or animal vectors. A chronic HAV carrier state
has not been reported.
Transmission
HAV infection is acquired primarily by the fecal-oral
route by either person-to-person contact or ingestion of
contaminated food or water. Because the virus is present
in blood during the illness prodrome, HAV has been trans-
mitted on rare occasions by transfusion. Although HAV
may be present in saliva, transmission by saliva has not
been demonstrated. Waterborne outbreaks are infrequent
and are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or
inadequately treated water.
Temporal Pattern
There is no appreciable seasonal variation in hepatitis A
incidence.
Communicability
Viral shedding persists for 1 to 3 weeks. Infected persons are
most likely to transmit HAV 1 to 2 weeks before the onset of

Groups at increased risk for hepatitis A or its complications
include international travelers, men who have sex with men,
and users of illegal drugs. Outbreaks of hepatitis A have
also been reported among persons working with hepatitis
A-infected primates. This is the only occupational group
known to be at increased risk for hepatitis A.
Persons with chronic liver disease are not at increased risk
of infection but are at increased risk of acquiring fulminant
hepatitis A. Persons with clotting factor disorders may be at
increased risk of HAV because of administration of solvent/
detergent-treated factor VIII and IX concentrates.
Foodhandlers are not at increased risk for hepatitis A
because of their occupation, but are noteworthy because
of their critical role in common-source foodborne HAV
transmission. Healthcare personnel do not have an
increased prevalence of HAV infections, and nosocomial
HAV transmission is rare. Nonetheless, outbreaks have been
observed in neonatal intensive care units and in association
with adult fecal incontinence. Institutions for persons with
developmental disabilities previously were sites of high HAV
endemicity. But as fewer children have been institutional-
ized and conditions within these institutions have improved,
HAV incidence and prevalence have decreased. However,
sporadic outbreaks can occur. Schools are not common sites
for HAV transmission. Multiple cases among children at a
school require investigation of a common source. Workers
exposed to sewage have not reported any work-related HAV
infection in the United States, but serologic data are not
available.
Children play an important role in HAV transmission.
Children generally have asymptomatic or unrecognized
illnesses, so they may serve as a source of infection, particu-
larly for household or other close contacts.

Hepatitis A
Secular Trends in the United States
In the United States, hepatitis A has occurred in large
nationwide epidemics approximately every 10 years,
with the last increase in cases in 1989. However, between
epidemics HAV infection continues to occur at relatively
high rates. Hepatitis A became nationally reportable as
a distinct entity in 1966. The largest number of cases
reported in one year (59,606) was in 1971. A total of 5,970
cases was reported in 2004. After adjusting for under-
reporting, 20,000 infections are estimated to have occurred
in 2004, approximately half of which were symptomatic.
Hepatitis A rates have been declining since 1995, and since
1998 have been at historically low levels. A total of 1,987
cases was reported in 2009. The wider use of vaccine is
probably contributing to this marked decrease in hepatitis
A rates in the United States.

to HAV (anti-HAV) among the general U.S. population is
33%. Seroprevalence of HAV antibody increases with age,
from 9% among 6- to 11-year-olds to 75% among persons
70 years of age and older. Anti-HAV prevalence is highest
among Mexican-Americans (70%), compared with blacks
(39%) and whites (23%). Anti-HAV prevalence is inversely

Prior to 2000, the incidence of reported hepatitis A was
substantially higher in the western United States than in
other parts of the country. From 1987 to 1997, 11 mostly
western states (Arizona, Alaska, Oregon, New Mexico, Utah,
Washington, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Idaho, Nevada,
California) accounted for 50% of all reported cases but only
22% of the U.S. population. Many of these high-incidence
states began routine hepatitis A vaccination programs for
children in the late 1990s. Since 2002, rates have been
similar in all parts of the country.

Many hepatitis A cases in the United States occur in the
context of communitywide epidemics. Communities that
experience such epidemics can be classified as high-rate
and intermediate-rate communities. High-rate communi-
ties typically have epidemics every 5 to 10 years that may
last for several years with substantial rates of disease

during outbreaks) but few cases among persons 15 years
of age and older. These communities often are relatively
well-defined either geographically or ethnically and
include Native American, Alaska Native, Pacific Islander,
and selected Hispanic communities and certain religious
communities. Experience with hepatitis A vaccination
programs in these high-rate communities has shown that
when relatively high (65% to 80%) first-dose vaccination
coverage of preschool and school-age children is achieved
and routine vaccination of young children is sustained,
ongoing outbreaks of hepatitis A could be interrupted.
In these areas, sustained reduction in HAV incidence
has been achieved and subsequent outbreaks have been
prevented.
18
Case Definition
The case definition for hepatitis A was approved by the
Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) in
1997. It reflects a clinical diagnosis of hepatitis and, because
HAV cannot be differentiated from other types of viral hepa-
titis on clinical or epidemiologic features alone, serologic
evidence of HAV-specific IgM antibody is necessary.
The clinical case definition for hepatitis A is an acute illness
with discrete onset of symptoms, and jaundice or elevated
serum aminotransferase levels. The laboratory criterion for
diagnosis is a positive IgM anti-HAV.
Hepatitis A Vaccine
Hepatitis A Vaccines
• Inactivated whole virus vaccines
• Pediatric and adult formulations
-pediatric formulations approved
for persons 12 months through
18 years
-adult formulations approved for
persons 19 years and older
Characteristics
Two inactivated whole-virus hepatitis A vaccines are
available: HAVRIX (GlaxoSmithKline) and VAQTA (Merck).
To produce each vaccine, cell culture-adapted virus
is propagated in human fibroblasts, purified from cell
lysates, inactivated with formalin, and adsorbed to an
aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. HAVRIX is prepared with a
preservative (2-phenoxyathanol); VAQTA does not contain a
preservative. Both vaccines are available in both pediatric
and adult formulations. The pediatric formulations of both
vaccines are approved for persons 12 months through 18
years. The adult formulations are approved for persons 19
years and older.
Hepatitis A Vaccine Immunogenicity
Adults
• >95% seropositive after one dose
• 100% seropositive after two doses
Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy
Both vaccines are highly immunogenic. More than 95%
of adults will develop protective antibody within 4 weeks
of a single dose of either vaccine, and nearly 100% will
seroconvert after receiving two doses. Among children and
adolescents, more than 97% will be seropositive within a

clinical hepatitis A was 94% among 40,000 Thai children 1 to
16 years of age who received two doses 1 month apart while
living in villages with high HAV disease rates. The efficacy
of VAQTA in protecting against clinical hepatitis A was 100%
among 1,000 New York children 2 to 16 years of age who
received one dose while living in a community with a high
HAV disease rate.

Data concerning the long-term persistence of antibody and
immune memory are limited because the current vaccines
have been available only since 1995 and 1996. Estimates
of antibody persistence derived from kinetic models of
antibody decline indicate that protective levels of anti-HAV
could be present for 20 years or longer. Other mechanisms
e.g., cellular) may contribute to long-term protection, but
this is unknown. The need for booster doses will be deter-
mined by postmarketing surveillance studies.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Following its introduction in 1995, hepatitis A vaccine was
primarily targeted to persons at increased risk for HAV
infection, particularly international travelers. While this
strategy prevented infection in this group and in other
vaccinated individuals, it had little or no impact on the
incidence of HAV infection in the United States.
ACIP Recommendation for Routine
Hepatitis A Vaccination of Children
• All children should receive hepatitis A
vaccine at 12-23 months of age
• Vaccination should be integrated into
the routine childhood vaccination
schedule
• Children who are not vaccinated by 2
years of age can be vaccinated at
subsequent visits
MMWR 2006;55(No.RR-7):1-23
As a result of successful vaccination programs in areas with
a high incidence of HAV infection, the Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in 1999 recommended
that routine vaccination of children 2 years of age and
older with hepatitis A vaccine be implemented in states,
counties or communities where the average annual
incidence of hepatitis A during 1987 through 1997 was 20
cases per 100,000 population or higher (i.e., at least twice
the U.S. average of 10 cases per 100,000 population). ACIP
also recommended that routine vaccination be considered
for states, counties or communities where the average
annual incidence of hepatitis A during 1987 through 1997
was 10 or more cases but less than 20 cases per 100,000
population. These strategies appear to have significantly
reduced the incidence of hepatitis A in these areas.
ACIP Recommendation for Routine
Hepatitis A Vaccination of Children
• States, counties, and communities
with existing hepatitis A vaccination
programs for children 2 through 18
years of age should maintain these
programs
• New efforts focused on routine
vaccination of children 12 months of
age should enhance, not replace
ongoing, vaccination programs for
older children
Based on the successful implementation of childhood
hepatitis A vaccination programs in high incidence areas,
ACIP recommended in 2005 that all children should
receive hepatitis A vaccine at 12 through 23 months of
age. Vaccination should be integrated into the routine

childhood vaccination schedule. Children who are not vacci-
nated by 2 years of age can be vaccinated at subsequent
visits. ACIP encourages states, counties, and communities
with existing hepatitis A vaccination programs for children 2
through 18 years of age to maintain these programs.
Persons at increased risk for HAV infection, or who are at
increased risk for complications of HAV infection, should
continue to be routinely vaccinated.

HAVRIX is available in two formulations: pediatric (720
ELISA units (EL.U.] per 0.5-ml dose) and adult (1,440 EL.U.
per 1.0-ml dose). Children 1 through 18 years of age should
receive a single primary dose of the pediatric formulation
followed by a booster dose 6 to 12 months later. Adults
19 years of age and older receive one dose of the adult
formulation followed by a booster 6 to 12 months later.
The vaccine should be administered intramuscularly into
the deltoid muscle. A needle length appropriate for the
vaccinee's age and size (minimum of 1 inch) should be used.

For both vaccines, the booster dose given should be based
on the person's age at the time of the booster dose, not the
age when the first dose was given. For example, if a person
received the first dose of the pediatric formulation of VAQTA
at 18 years of age, and returns for the booster dose at age

Twinrix
1
• Combination hepatitis A vaccine
(pediatric dose) and hepatitis B
(adult dose)
• Schedule: 0, 1, 6 months
• Approved for persons 18 years of
age and older
Combination Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B Vaccine
In 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
a combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix,
GlaxoSmithKline). Each dose of Twinrix contains 720 EL.U.
of hepatitis A vaccine (equivalent to a pediatric dose of
HAVRIX), and 20 mcg of hepatitis B surface antigen protein
(equivalent to an adult dose of Engerix-B). The vaccine is
administered in a three-dose series at 0, 1, and 6 months.
Appropriate spacing of the doses must be maintained to
assure long-term protection from both vaccines. The first
and second doses should be separated by at least 4 weeks,
and the second and third doses should be separated by
at least 5 months. Twinrix is approved for persons aged
18 years and older and can be used in persons in this age
group with indications for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B
vaccines.
In 2007, FDA approved an alternative schedule for Twinrix
with doses at 0,7, and 21 through 30 days and a booster
dose 12 months after the first dose.
Because the hepatitis B component of Twinrix is equivalent
to a standard dose of hepatitis B vaccine, the schedule is the
same whether Twinrix or single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine
is used.
Single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine may be used to complete
a series begun with Twinrix and vice versa. A person 19
years of age or older who receives one dose of Twinrix may
complete the hepatitis A series with two doses of adult
formulation hepatitis A vaccine separated by at least 5
months. A person who receives two doses of Twinrix may
complete the hepatitis A series with one dose of adult
formulation hepatitis A vaccine or Twinrix 5 months after
the second dose. A person who begins the hepatitis A series

with single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine may complete the
series with two doses of Twinrix or one dose of adult formu-
lation hepatitis A vaccine. An 18-year-old should follow the
same schedule using the pediatric formulation.
18
Persons at Increased Risk for Hepatitis A or
Severe Outcomes of Infection
Persons at increased risk for hepatitis A should be identi-
fied and vaccinated. Hepatitis A vaccine should be strongly
considered for persons 1 year of age and older who are
traveling to or working in countries where they would have a
high or intermediate risk of hepatitis A virus infection. These
areas include all areas of the world except Canada, Western
Europe and Scandinavia, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia.
The first dose of hepatitis A vaccine should be administered
as soon as travel is considered. For healthy persons 40 years
of age or younger, 1 dose of single antigen vaccine admin-
istered at any time before departure can provide adequate
protection.
Unvaccinated adults older than 40 years of age, immuno-
compromised persons, and persons with chronic liver disease
planning to travel in 2 weeks or sooner should receive the
first dose of vaccine and also can receive immune globulin at
the same visit. Vaccine and I should be administered with
separate syringes at different anatomic sites.
Hepatitis A
Vaccine Recommendations
Travelers who choose not to receive vaccine should receive
a single dose of IG (0.02 ml/kg), which provides protection
against HAV infection for up to 3 months. Persons whose
travel period is more than 2 months should be administered
IG at 0.06 ml/kg. IG should be repeated in 5 months for
prolonged travel.
• International travelers
• Close contact with an international adoptee from
a country of high or intermediate endemicity
• Men who have sex with men
• Persons who use illegal drugs
• Persons who have a clotting factor disorder
• Persons with occupational risk
• Persons with chronic liver disease
In 2009 ACIP recommended hepatitis A vaccination for
all previously unvaccinated persons who anticipate close
personal contact (e.g., household contact or regular babysit-
ting) with an international adoptee from a country of high
or intermediate endemicity during the first 60 days following
arrival of the adoptee in the United States. The first dose of
the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered
as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks
before the arrival of the adoptee.
Other groups that should be offered vaccine include men
who have sex with other men, persons who use illegal drugs,
persons who have clotting factor disorders, and persons with
occupational risk of infection. Persons with occupational
risk include only those who work with hepatitis A-infected
primates or with hepatitis A virus in a laboratory setting.
110


## p. 111 (#125) ############################################

Hepatitis A
No other groups have been shown to be at increased risk of
hepatitis A infection due to occupational exposure.
Persons with chronic liver disease are not at increased
risk for HAV infection because of their liver disease alone.
However, these persons are at increased risk for fulminant
hepatitis A should they become infected. Susceptible
persons who have chronic liver disease should be vacci-
nated. Susceptible persons who either are awaiting or have
received liver transplants should be vaccinated.
8.
Hepatitis A vaccination is not routinely recommended for
healthcare personnel, persons attending or working in
child care centers, or persons who work in liquid or solid
waste management (e.g., sewer workers or plumbers).
These groups have not been shown to be at increased risk
for hepatitis A infection. ACIP does not recommend routine
hepatitis A vaccination for food service workers, but vaccina-
tion may be considered based on local epidemiology.
Hepatitis A
Vaccine Recommendations
• Healthcare personnel not routinely
recommended
• Child care centers: not routinely
recommended
• Sewer workers or plumbers: not
routinely recommended
• Food handlers: may be considered
based on local circumstances
Hepatitis A Serologic Testing
Prevaccination
- not indicated for children
- may be considered for some
adults and older adolescents
Prevaccination Serologic Testing
HAV infection produces lifelong immunity to hepatitis A, so
there is no benefit of vaccinating someone with serologic
evidence of past HAV infection. The risk for adverse events
following vaccination of such persons is not higher than
the risk for serologically negative persons. As a result, the
decision to conduct prevaccination testing should be based
chiefly on the prevalence of immunity, the cost of testing
and vaccinating (including office visit costs), and the likeli-
hood that testing will interfere with initiating vaccination.
Postvaccination
- not indicated
Testing of children is not indicated because of their expected
low prevalence of infection. Persons for whom prevac-
cination serologic testing will likely be most cost-effective
include adults who were either born in or lived for extensive
periods in geographic areas that have a high endemicity of
HAV infection (e.g., Central and South America, Africa, Asia);
older adolescents and adults in certain populations (i.e.,
Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Hispanics); adults in
certain groups that have a high prevalence of infection (see
above); and adults 40 years of age and older.
Commercially available tests for total anti-HAV should be
used for prevaccination testing.
Postvaccination Serologic Testing
Postvaccination testing is not indicated because of the
high rate of vaccine response among adults and children.
Testing methods sufficiently sensitive to detect low anti-HAV
concentrations after vaccination are not approved for
routine diagnostic use in the United States.

Hepatitis A Vaccine
Contraindications and Precautions
• Severe allergic reaction to a
vaccine component or following a
prior dose
• Moderate or severe acute illness
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Hepatitis A vaccine should not be administered to persons
with a history of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a
vaccine component or following a prior dose of hepatitis A
vaccine, hypersensitivity to alum or, in the case of HAVRIX,
to the preservative 2-phenoxyethanol. Vaccination of persons
with moderate or severe acute illnesses should be deferred
until the person's condition has improved.
8
The safety of hepatitis A vaccination during pregnancy has
not been determined. However, because it is an inactivated
vaccine, the theoretical risk to the fetus is low. The risk asso-
ciated with vaccination should be weighed against the risk
for HAV infection. Because hepatitis A vaccine is inactivated,
no special precautions are needed when vaccinating immu-
nocompromised persons, although response to the vaccine
may be suboptimal.
Hepatitis A
Vaccine Adverse Reactions
• Pain at injection site
• Systemic reactions not common
• No serious adverse reactions
reported
Adverse Reactions Following
Vaccination
For both vaccines, the most commonly reported adverse
reaction following vaccination is a local reaction at the site
of injection. Injection site pain, erythema, or swelling is
reported by 20% to 50% of recipients. These symptoms are
generally mild and self-limited. Mild systemic complaints
(e.g., malaise, fatigue, low-grade fever) are reported by fewer
than 10% of recipients. No serious adverse reactions have
been reported.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Hepatitis A vaccine should be stored and shipped at
temperatures of 35°-46°F (20-8°C) and should not be frozen.
Postexposure Prophylaxis
Immune globulin (1G) is typically used for postexposure
prophylaxis of hepatitis A in susceptible persons. Hepatitis
A vaccine may be used for postexposure prophylaxis in
healthy persons 12 months through 40 years of age. Immune
globulin is preferred for persons older than 40 years of age,
children younger than 12 months of age, immunocompro-
mised persons, and persons with chronic liver disease. See
MMWR 2007;56(No.41):1080-84 (October 19, 2007) for details.

Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B
Viral hepatitis is a term commonly used for several clini-
cally similar yet etiologically and epidemiologically distinct
diseases. Hepatitis A (formerly called infectious hepatitis)
and hepatitis B (formerly called serum hepatitis) have been
recognized as separate entities since the early 1940s and can
be diagnosed with specific serologic tests. Delta hepatitis
is an infection dependent on the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It
may occur as a coinfection with acute HBV infection or as
superinfection of an HBV carrier.
• Epidemic jaundice described by
Hippocrates in 5th century BCE
• Jaundice reported among recipients
of human serum and yellow fever
vaccines in 1930s and 1940s
• Australia antigen described in 1965
• Serologic tests developed in 1970s
9
Epidemic jaundice was described by Hippocrates in the 5th
century BCE. The first recorded cases of “serum hepatitis,”
or hepatitis B, are thought to be those that followed the
administration of smallpox vaccine containing human
lymph to shipyard workers in Germany in 1883. In the early
and middle parts of the 20th century, serum hepatitis was
repeatedly observed following the use of contaminated
needles and syringes. The role of blood as a vehicle for virus
transmission was further emphasized in 1943, when Beeson
described jaundice that had occurred in seven recipients of
blood transfusions. Australia antigen, later called hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg), was first described in 1965, and the
Dane particle (complete hepatitis B virion) was identified in
1970. Identification of serologic markers for HBV infection
followed, which helped clarify the natural history of the
disease. Ultimately, HBsAg was prepared in quantity and
now comprises the immunogen in highly effective vaccines
for prevention of HBV infection.
Hepatitis B Virus
Hepatitis B Virus
HBV is a small, double-shelled virus in the family
Hepadnaviridae. Other Hepadnaviridae include duck hepa-
titis virus, ground squirrel hepatitis virus, and woodchuck
hepatitis virus. The virus has a small circular DNA genome
that is partially double-stranded. HBV contains numerous
antigenic components, including HBsAg, hepatitis B core
antigen (HBcAg), and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). Humans
are the only known host for HBV, although some nonhuman
primates have been infected in laboratory conditions. HBV
is relatively resilient and, in some instances, has been shown
to remain infectious on environmental surfaces for more
than 7 days at room temperature.
. Hepadnaviridae family (DNA)
• Numerous antigenic components
• Humans are only known host
• May retain infectivity for more
than 7 days at room temperature
Hepatitis B Virus Infection
An estimated 2 billion persons worldwide have been
infected with HBV, and more than 350 million persons have
chronic, lifelong infections. HBV infection is an established
cause of acute and chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. It is the
cause of up to 80% of hepatocellular carcinomas. The World
Health Organization estimated that more than 600,000
persons died worldwide in 2002 of hepatitis B-associated
acute and chronic liver disease.

## p. 116 (#130) ############################################

Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B Virus
HBsAg
Several well-defined antigen-antibody systems are associ-
ated with HBV infection. HBsAg, formerly called Australia
antigen or hepatitis-associated antigen, is an antigenic
determinant found on the surface of the virus. It also makes
up subviral 22-nm spherical and tubular particles. HBsAg
can be identified in serum 30 to 60 days after exposure to
HBV and persists for variable periods. HBsAg is not infec-
tious. Only the complete virus (Dane particle) is infectious.
However, when HBsAg is present in the blood, complete
virus is also present, and the person may transmit the virus.
During replication, HBV produces HBsAg in excess of that
needed for production of Dane particles.

HBcAg
HBeAg
9
HBcAg is the nucleocapsid protein core of HBV. HBcAg is not
detectable in serum by conventional techniques, but it can
be detected in liver tissue of persons with acute or chronic
HBV infection. HBeAg, a soluble protein, is also contained in
the core of HBV. HBeAg is detected in the serum of persons
with high virus titers and indicates high infectivity. Antibody
to HBsAg (anti-HBs) develops during convalescence after
acute HBV infection or following hepatitis B vaccination. The
presence of anti-HBs indicates immunity to HBV. (Anti-HBs
is sometimes referred to as HBsAb, but use of this term is
discouraged because of potential confusion with HBsAg.)
Antibody to HBcAg (anti-HBc) indicates infection with HBV at
an undefined time in the past. IgM class antibody to HBcAg
(IgM anti-HBc) indicates recent infection with HBV. Antibody
to HBeAg (anti-HBe) becomes detectable when HBeAg is lost
and is associated with low infectivity of serum.
Hepatitis B Clinical Features
Clinical Features
The clinical course of acute hepatitis B is indistinguishable
from that of other types of acute viral hepatitis. The incuba-
tion period ranges from 60 to 150 days (average, 90 days).
Clinical signs and symptoms occur more often in adults than
in infants or children, who usually have an asymptomatic
acute course. However, approximately 50% of adults who
have acute infections are asymptomatic.
• Incubation period 60-150 days
(average 90 days)
• Nonspecific prodrome of malaise,
fever, headache, myalgia
• Illness not specific for hepatitis B
• At least 50% of infections
asymptomatic
The preicteric, or prodromal phase from initial symptoms
to onset of jaundice usually lasts from 3 to 10 days. It
is nonspecific and is characterized by insidious onset of
malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant
abdominal pain, fever, headache, myalgia, skin rashes,
arthralgia and arthritis, and dark urine, beginning 1 to
2 days before the onset of jaundice. The icteric phase is
variable but usually lasts from I to 3 weeks and is character-
ized by jaundice, light or gray stools, hepatic tenderness
and hepatomegaly (splenomegaly is less common). During
convalescence, malaise and fatigue may persist for weeks
or months, while jaundice, anorexia, and other symptoms
disappear.

Hepatitis B
Most acute HBV infections in adults result in complete
recovery with elimination of HBsAg from the blood and the
production of anti-HBs, creating immunity to future infec-
tion.
Hepatitis B Complications
Complications
While most acute HBV infections in adults result in complete
recovery, fulminant hepatitis occurs in about 1% to 2% of
acutely infected persons. About 200 to 300 Americans die of
fulminant disease each year (case-fatality rate 63% to 93%).
Although the consequences of acute HBV infection can be
severe, most of the serious complications associated with
HBV infection are due to chronic infection.
• Fulminant hepatitis
• Hospitalization
• Cirrhosis
• Hepatocellular carcinoma
• Death

Chronic Hepatitis B
Virus Infection
Chronic HBV Infection
Approximately 5% of all acute HBV infections progress to
chronic infection, with the risk of chronic HBV infection
decreasing with age. As many as 90% of infants who acquire
HBV infection from their mothers at birth become chroni-
cally infected. Of children who become infected with HBV
between 1 year and 5 years of age, 30% to 50% become
chronically infected. By adulthood, the risk of acquiring
chronic HBV infection is approximately 5%.

• Responsible for most mortality
• Overall risk 5%

Persons with chronic infection are often asymptomatic and
may not be aware that they are infected; however, they
are capable of infecting others and have been referred
to as carriers. Chronic infection is responsible for most
HBV-related morbidity and mortality, including chronic
hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular
carcinoma. Approximately 25% of persons with chronic HBV
infection die prematurely from cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Chronic active hepatitis develops in more than 25% of
carriers and often results in cirrhosis. An estimated 3,000 to
4,000 persons die of hepatitis B-related cirrhosis each year
in the United States. Persons with chronic HBV infection are
at 12 to 300 times higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma
than noncarriers. An estimated 1,000 to 1,500 persons die
each year in the United States of hepatitis B-related liver
cancer.

Laboratory Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic
findings. HBV infection cannot be differentiated on the basis
of clinical symptoms alone, and definitive diagnosis depends
on the results of serologic testing. Serologic markers of HBV
infection vary depending on whether the infection is acute
or chronic.
HBsAg is the most commonly used test for diagnosing
acute HBV infections or detecting carriers. HBsAg can be
detected as early as 1 or 2 weeks and as late as 11 or 12

weeks after exposure to HBV when sensitive assays are used.
The presence of HBsAg indicates that a person is infectious,
regardless of whether the infection is acute or chronic.
Anti-HBc (core antibody) develops in all HBV infections,
appears shortly after HBsAg in acute disease, and indicates
HBV infection at some undefined time in the past. Anti-HBC
only occurs after HBV infection and does not develop in
persons whose immunity to HBV is from vaccine. Anti-HBC
generally persists for life and is not a serologic marker for
acute infection.
9
IgM anti-HBc appears in persons with acute disease about
the time of illness onset and indicates recent infection with
HBV. IgM anti-HBc is generally detectable 4 to 6 months
after onset of illness and is the best serologic marker
of acute HBV infection. A negative test for IgM-anti-HBC
together with a positive test for HBsAg in a single blood
sample identifies a chronic HBV infection.

HBeAg is a useful marker associated strongly with the
number of infective HBV particles in the serum and a higher
risk of infectivity.
Anti-HBs (surface antibody) is a protective, neutralizing

infection generally indicates recovery and immunity against
reinfection. Anti-HBs can also be acquired as an immune
response to hepatitis B vaccine or passively transferred
by administration of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG).
When using radioimmunoassay (RIA), a minimum of 10
sample ratio units should be used to designate immunity.
With enzyme immunoassay (EIA), the manufacturer's
recommended positive should be considered an appropriate
measure of immunity. The level of anti-HBs may also be
expressed in milli-international units/mL (mIU/mL). Ten
mlU/mL is considered to indicate a protective level of
immunity.

Medical Management
There is no specific therapy for acute HBV infection.
Treatment is supportive. Interferon is the most effective
treatment for chronic HBV infection and is successful in 25%
to 50% of cases.
Persons with acute or chronic HBV infections should prevent
their blood and other potentially infective body fluids from
contacting other persons. They should not donate blood or
share toothbrushes or razors with household members.
In the hospital setting, patients with HBV infection should
be managed with standard precautions.

Although other primates have been infected in laboratory
conditions, HBV infection affects only humans. No animal or
insect hosts or vectors are known to exist.

Transmission
The virus is transmitted by parenteral or mucosal exposure
to HBsAg-positive body fluids from persons who have acute
or chronic HBV infection. The highest concentrations of
virus are in blood and serous fluids; lower titers are found
in other fluids, such as saliva and semen. Saliva can be a
vehicle of transmission through bites; however, other types
of exposure to saliva, including kissing, are unlikely modes
of transmission. There appears to be no transmission of HBV
via tears, sweat, urine, stool, or droplet nuclei.

Hepatitis B
In the United States, the most important route of transmis-
sion is by sexual contact, either heterosexual or homosexual,
with an infected person. Fecal-oral transmission does not
appear to occur. However, transmission occurs among men
who have sex with men, possibly via contamination from
asymptomatic rectal mucosal lesions.
19
Direct percutaneous inoculation of HBV by needles during
injection-drug use is an important mode of transmission.
Transmission of HBV may also occur by other percutaneous
exposure, including tattooing, ear piercing, and acupunc-
ture, as well as needlesticks or other injuries from sharp
instruments sustained by medical personnel. These expo-
sures account for only a small proportion of reported cases
in the United States. Breaks in the skin without overt needle
puncture, such as fresh cutaneous scratches, abrasions,
burns, or other lesions, may also serve as routes for entry.
Contamination of mucosal surfaces with infective serum or
plasma may occur during mouth pipetting, eye splashes,
or other direct contact with mucous membranes of the
eyes or mouth, such as hand-to-mouth or hand-to-eye
contact when hands are contaminated with infective blood
or serum. Transfer of infective material to skin lesions or
mucous membranes via inanimate environmental surfaces
may occur by touching surfaces of various types of hospital
equipment. Contamination of mucosal surfaces with infec-
tive secretions other than serum or plasma could occur with
contact involving semen.

If positive for HBsAg only

Perinatal transmission from mother to infant at birth is
very efficient. If the mother is positive for both HBsAg and
HBeAg, 70%-90% of infants will become infected in the
absence of postexposure prophylaxis. The risk of perinatal
transmission is about 10% if the mother is positive only
for HBsAg. As many as 90% of these infected infants will
become chronically infected with HBV.
"in the absence of postexposure prophylaxis
The frequency of infection and patterns of transmission
vary in different parts of the world. Approximately 45% of
the global population live in areas with a high prevalence
of chronic HBV infection (8% or more of the population is
HBsAg positive), 43% in areas with a moderate prevalence
(2% to 7% of the population is HBsAg positive), and 12% in
areas with a low prevalence (less than 2% of the population
is HBsAg positive).
Global Patterns of

-lifetime risk of infection >60%
-early childhood infections common
• Intermediate (2%-7%): 43% of global
population
-lifetime risk of infection 20%-60%
-infections occur in all age groups
• Low (<2%): 12% of global population
-lifetime risk of infection <20%
-most infections occur in adult risk groups
In China, Southeast Asia, most of Africa, most Pacific Islands,
parts of the Middle East, and the Amazon Basin, 8% to
15% of the population carry the virus. The lifetime risk of
HBV infection is greater than 60%, and most infections are
acquired at birth or during early childhood, when the risk
of developing chronic infections is greatest. In these areas,
because most infections are asymptomatic, very little acute

disease related to HBV occurs, but rates of chronic liver
disease and liver cancer among adults are very high. In the
United States, Western Europe, and Australia, HBV infection
is a disease of low endemicity. Infection occurs primarily
during adulthood, and only 0.1% to 0.5% of the population
are chronic carriers. Lifetime risk of HBV infection is less
than 20% in low prevalence areas.
Communicability
Persons with either acute or chronic HBV infection should
be considered infectious any time that HBsAg is present
in the blood. When symptoms are present in persons with
acute HBV infection, HBsAg can be found in blood and
body fluids for 1–2 months before and after the onset of
symptoms.

The incidence of reported hepatitis B peaked in the

Reported cases have declined since that time, and fell below
10,000 cases for the first time in 1996. The decline in cases
during the 1980s and early 1990s is generally attributed to
reduction of transmission among men who have sex with men
and injection-drug users as a result of HIV prevention efforts.
Year
During 1990–2004, incidence of acute hepatitis B in the
United States declined 75%. The greatest decline (94%)
occurred among children and adolescents, coincident with
an increase in hepatitis B vaccine coverage. A total of 3,405
cases of hepatitis B were reported in 2009.

Although HBV infection is uncommon among adults in the
general population (the lifetime risk of infection is less
than 20%), it is highly prevalent in certain groups. Risk for
infection varies with occupation, lifestyle, or environment
(see table). Generally, the highest risk for HBV infection is
associated with lifestyles, occupations, or environments in
which contact with blood from infected persons is frequent.
In addition, the prevalence of HBV markers for acute or
chronic infection increases with increasing number of years
of high-risk behavior. For instance, an estimated 40% of
injection-drug users become infected with HBV after 1 year
of drug use, while more than 80% are infected after 10 years.

Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B Prevention Strategies
Hepatitis B vaccines have been available in the United States
since 1981. However, the impact of vaccine on HBV disease
has been less than optimal.
The apparent lack of impact from the vaccine can be attrib-
uted to several factors. From 1981 until 1991, vaccination
was targeted to persons in groups at high risk of acquiring
HBV infection. A large proportion of persons with HBV
infection (25% to 30%) deny having any risk factors for the
disease. These persons would not be identified by a targeted
risk factor screening approach.
9
The three major risk groups (heterosexuals with contact with
infected persons or multiple partners, injection-drug users,
and men who have sex with men) are not reached effectively
by targeted programs. Deterrents to immunization of these
groups include lack of awareness of the risk of disease and
its consequences, lack of effective public or private sector
programs, and vaccine cost. Difficulty in gaining access to
these populations is also a problem. Further, success in
providing vaccine to persons in high-risk groups has been
limited because of rapid acquisition of infection after begin-
ning high-risk behaviors, low initial vaccine acceptance, and
low rates of completion of vaccinations.
A comprehensive strategy to eliminate hepatitis B virus
transmission was recommended in 1991; it includes
prenatal testing of pregnant women for HBsAg to identify
newborns who require immunoprophylaxis for prevention
of perinatal infection and to identify household contacts
who should be vaccinated, routine vaccination of infants,
vaccination of adolescents, and vaccination of adults at high
risk for infection. Recommendations to further enhance
vaccination of adults at increased risk of HBV infection were
published in 2006.

Characteristics
A plasma-derived vaccine was licensed in the United States
in 1981. It was produced from 22-nm HBsAg particles
purified from the plasma of chronically infected humans.
The vaccine was safe and effective but was not well
accepted, possibly because of unsubstantiated fears of trans-
mission of live HBV and other bloodborne pathogens (e.g.,
human immunodeficiency virus). This vaccine was removed
from the U.S. market in 1992.

• Duration of

at least 20 years
Recombinant vaccine is produced by inserting a plasmid
containing the gene for HBsAg into common baker's yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Yeast cells then produce HBsAg,
which is harvested and purified. The recombinant vaccine
contains more than 95% HBsAg protein (5 to 40 mcg/mL);
yeast-derived proteins may constitute up to 5% of the final
product, but no yeast DNA is detectable in the vaccine.
HBV infection cannot result from use of the recombinant
vaccine, since no potentially infectious viral DNA or
complete viral particles are produced in the recombi-
nant system. Vaccine HBsAg is adsorbed to aluminum
hydroxide.

· 10 mcg/1 mL (adult)
- 40 mcg/1 mL (dialysis)
Hepatitis B vaccine is produced by two manufacturers
in the United States, Merck (Recombivax HB) and
GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals (Engerix-B). Both
vaccines are available in both pediatric and adult formu-
lations. Although the antigen content of the vaccines
differs, vaccines made by different manufacturers are
interchangeable, except for the two-dose schedule for
adolescents aged 11 through 15 years. Only Merck vaccine
is approved for this schedule. Providers must always follow
the manufacturer's dosage recommendations.
Engerix-B (GSK)
- 10 mcg/0.5 mL (pediatric)
- 20 mcg/1 mL (adult)
Both the pediatric and adult formulations of Recombivax
HB are approved for use in any age group. For example,
the adult formulation of Recombivax HB may be used
in children (0.5 mL) and adolescents (0.5 mL). However,
pediatric Engerix-B is approved for use only in children
and adolescents younger than 20 years of age. The adult
formulation of Engerix-B is not approved for use in infants
and children but may be used in both adolescents (11
through 19 years of age) and adults.
Engerix-B contains aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant. It
does not contain thimerosal as a preservative but contains
a trace of thimerosal as residual from the manufacturing
process. The vaccine is supplied in single-dose vials and
syringes. Recombivax HB contains aluminum hydroxyphos-
phate sulfate as an adjuvant. None of the formulations of
Recombivax HB contain thimerosal or any other preserva-
tive. The vaccine is supplied in single-dose vials.
Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy
After three intramuscular doses of hepatitis B vaccine,
more than 90% of healthy adults and more than 95% of
infants, children, and adolescents (from birth to 19 years of
age) develop adequate antibody responses. However, there
is an age-specific decline in immunogenicity. After age 40
years, approximately 90% of recipients respond to a three-
dose series, and by 60 years, only 75% of vaccinees develop

The vaccine is 80% to 100% effective in preventing infection
or clinical hepatitis in those who receive the complete
course of vaccine. Larger vaccine doses (2 to 4 times the
normal adult dose) or an increased number of doses are
required to induce protective antibody in a high proportion
of hemodialysis patients and may also be necessary in other
immunocompromised persons.
The recommended dosage of vaccine differs depending
on the age of the recipient and type of vaccine (see table).
Hemodialysis patients should receive a 40-mcg dose in a
series of three or four doses. Recombivax HB has a special
dialysis patient formulation that contains 40 mcg/mL.

The deltoid muscle is the recommended site for hepatitis
B vaccination in adults and children, while the antero-
lateral thigh is recommended for infants and neonates.
Immunogenicity of vaccine in adults is lower when injec-
tions are given in the gluteus. Hepatitis B vaccine should
be administered to newborns using a needle of at least 5/8
inch length and to older children and adults of at least 1
inch length. Hepatitis B vaccine administered by any route
or site other than intramuscularly in the anterolateral
thigh or deltoid muscle should not be counted as valid and
should be repeated unless serologic testing indicates that an
adequate response has been achieved.

• Chronic infection rarely

.
Available data show that vaccine-induced antibody levels
decline with time. However, immune memory remains
intact for more than 20 years following immunization, and
both adults and children with declining antibody levels are
still protected against significant HBV infection (i.e., clinical
disease, HBsAg antigenemia, or significant elevation of
liver enzymes). Exposure to HBV results in an anamnestic
anti-HBs response that prevents clinically significant HBV
infection. Chronic HBV infection has only rarely been docu-
mented among vaccine responders.
Hepatitis B Vaccine
For adults and children with normal immune status, booster
doses of vaccine are not recommended. Routine serologic
testing to assess immune status of vaccinees is not recom-
mended. The need for booster doses after longer intervals
will continue to be assessed as additional information
becomes available.
Routine booster doses
are NOT routinely
recommended for any
group
For hemodialysis patients, the need for booster doses should
be assessed by annual testing of vaccinees for antibody
levels, and booster doses should be provided when antibody
levels decline below 10 mU/mL.

mL (10 mcg) of pediatric Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline). Primary
vaccination consists of three intramuscular doses of vaccine.
The usual schedule is 0, 1 to 2, and 6 to 18 months. Infants
whose mothers are HBsAg positive or whose HBsAg status is
unknown should receive the last (third or fourth) dose by 6
months of age (12 to 15 months if Comvax is used).

However, schedules with 2-month intervals between doses,
which conform to schedules for other childhood vaccines,
have been shown to produce good antibody responses and
may be appropriate in populations in which it is difficult to
ensure that infants will be brought back for all their vaccina-
tions. However, the third dose must be administered at least
8 weeks after the second dose, and should follow the first
dose by at least 16 weeks. For infants, the third dose should
not be given earlier than 24 weeks of age. It is not necessary
to add doses or restart the series if the interval between
doses is longer than recommended.

• At least 16 weeks after first dose,

Preterm Infants
• Birth dose and HBIG if mother
HBsAg positive
• Preterm infants <2,000 grams

• Delay first dose until chronologic
age 1 month if mother HBsAg
negative
Preterm infants born to HBsAg-positive women and women
with unknown HBsAg status must receive immunopro-
phylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune
globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. See the section on
Postexposure Prophylaxis for additional information. Preterm
infants with low birthweight (i.e., less than 2,000 grams) have
a decreased response to hepatitis B vaccine administered
before 1 month of age. However, by chronologic age 1 month,
preterm infants, regardless of initial birthweight or gesta-
tional age, are as likely to respond as adequately as full-term
infants. Preterm infants of low birthweight whose mothers
are HBsAg negative can receive the first dose of the hepatitis
B vaccine series at chronologic age 1 month. Preterm infants
discharged from the hospital before chronologic age 1 month
can also be administered hepatitis B vaccine at discharge
if they are medically stable and have gained weight consis-
tently. The full recommended dose should be used. Divided
or reduced doses are not recommended.
COMVAX
Comyax
Hepatitis B vaccine is available in combination with
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine as Comvax
(Merck). Each dose of Comvax contains 7.5 mcg of PRP-OMP
Hib vaccine (PedvaxHIB), and 5 mcg of hepatitis B surface
antigen. The dose of hepatitis B surface antigen is the same
as that contained in Merck's pediatric formulation. The
immunogenicity of the combination vaccine is equivalent to
that of the individual antigens administered at separate sites.
• Hepatitis B-Hib combination
• Use when either antigen is indicated
• Cannot use before 6 weeks of age
• May be used in infants whose
mothers are HBsAg positive or
status is unknown
Comvax is licensed for use at 2, 4, and 12 through 15 months
of age. It may be used whenever either antigen is indicated
and the other antigen is not contraindicated. However, the
vaccine must not be administered to infants younger than 6
weeks of age because of potential suppression of the immune
response to the Hib component (see Chapter 7, Haemophilus
influenzae type b, for more details). Comvax must not be used
for doses at birth or 1 month of age for a child on a 0, 1,6
month hepatitis B vaccine schedule. Although it is not labeled
for this indication by FDA, ACIP recommends that Comvax
may be used in infants whose mothers are HBsAg positive or
whose HBsAg status is unknown.

Pediarix
In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration approved
Pediarix (GlaxoSmithKline), the first pentavalent (5-compo-
nent) combination vaccine licensed in the United States.
Pediarix contains DTP (Infanrix), hepatitis B (Engerix-B),
and inactivated polio vaccines. In prelicensure studies,
the proportion of children who developed a protective
level of antibody, and the titer of antibody, were at least
as high among children receiving the vaccine antigens
given together as Pediarix as among children who received
separate vaccines.
The minimum age for the first dose of Pediarix is 6 weeks,
so it cannot be used for the birth dose of the hepatitis B
series. Pediarix is approved for the first three doses of the
DTP and IPV series, which are usually given at about 2, 4,
and 6 months of age; it is not approved for fourth or fifth
(booster) doses of the DTP or IPV series. However, Pediarix
is approved for use through 6 years of age. A child who
is behind schedule can still receive Pediarix as long as it
is given for doses 1, 2, or 3 of the series, and the child is
younger than 7 years of age.
A dose of Pediarix inadvertently administered as the fourth

hepatitis B vaccine (total of 4 doses)
• May be used in infants whose
mothers are HBsAg positive or
status unknown
Pediarix may be used interchangeably with other pertussis-
containing vaccines if necessary (although ACIP prefers the
use of the same brand of DTap for all doses of the series,
if possible). It can be given at 2, 4, and 6 months to infants
who received a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine (total of
4 doses of hepatitis B vaccine). Although not labeled for
this indication by FDA, Pediarix may be used in infants
whose mothers are HBsAg positive or whose HBsAg status is
unknown.
Hepatitis B Vaccine
Adolescent Vaccination
• Routine vaccination recommended
through age 18 years
• Integrate into routine adolescent
immunization visit
• Flexible schedules
Adolescents
Routine hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for
all children and adolescents through age 18 years. All
children not previously vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine
should be vaccinated at 11 or 12 years of age with the
age-appropriate dose of vaccine. When adolescent vaccina-
tion programs are being considered, local data should be
considered to determine the ideal age group to vaccinate
(i.e., preadolescents, young adolescents) to achieve the
highest vaccination rates. The vaccination schedule should
be flexible and should take into account the feasibility
of delivering three doses of vaccine to this age group.
Unvaccinated older adolescents should be vaccinated
whenever possible. Those in groups at risk for HBV infec-
tion (e.g., Asian and Pacific Islanders, sexually active)
should be identified and vaccinated in settings serving

Hepatitis B Vaccine
Adolescent and Adult Schedule
Persons younger than 20 years of age should receive 0.5
mL (5 mcg) of pediatric or adult formulation Recombivax
HB (Merck) or 0.5 ml (10 mcg) of pediatric formulation
Engerix-B (GlaxoSmithKline). The adult formulation of
Engerix-B may be used in adolescents, but the approved
dose is 1 mL (20 mcg).

The usual schedule for adolescents is two doses separated
by no less than 4 weeks, and a third dose 4 to 6 months
after the second dose. If an accelerated schedule is needed,
the minimum interval between the first two doses is 4
weeks, and the minimum interval between the second and
third doses is 8 weeks. However, the first and third doses
should be separated by no less than 16 weeks. Doses given
at less than these minimum intervals should not be counted
as part of the vaccination series.
In 1999, the Food and Drug Administration approved an
alternative hepatitis B vaccination schedule for adolescents
11 through 15 years of age. This alternative schedule is for
two 1.0-ml (10 mcg) doses of Recombivax HB separated
by 4 to 6 months. Seroconversion rates and postvac-
cination anti-HBs antibody titers were similar using this
schedule or the standard schedule of three 5-mcg doses
of RecombivaxHB. This alternative schedule is approved
only for adolescents 11 through 15 years of age, and for
Merck's hepatitis B vaccine. The 2-dose schedule should be
completed by age 16 years.
Alternative Adolescent
Vaccination Schedule
• Two 1.0-mL (10 mcg) doses of
Recombivax HB separated by
4-6 months
• Approved only for adolescents
11-15 years of age
• Only applies to Merck hepatitis B
vaccine
Adults (20 Years of Age and Older)
Routine preexposure vaccination should be considered for
groups of adults who are at increased risk of HBV infection.
Adults 20 years of age and older should receive 1 mL (10
mcg) of pediatric or adult formulation Recombivax HB
(Merck) or 1 mL (20 mcg) of adult formulation Engerix-B
(GlaxoSmithKline). The pediatric formulation of Engerix-B is
not approved for use in adults.
The usual schedule for adults is two doses separated by
no less than 4 weeks, and a third dose 4 to 6 months after
the second dose. If an accelerated schedule is needed, the
minimum interval between the first two doses is 4 weeks,
and the minimum interval between the second and third
doses is 8 weeks. However, the first and third doses should
be separated by no less than 16 weeks. Doses given at less
than these minimum intervals should not be counted as
part of the vaccination series. It is not necessary to restart
the series or add doses because of an extended interval
between doses.

Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all unvaccinated
adults at risk for HBV infection and for all adults requesting
protection from HBV infection. Acknowledgment of a specific
risk factor should not be a requirement for vaccination.
Adults at Risk for HBV Infection
• Sexual exposure
-sex partners of HBsAg-positive
persons
-sexually active persons not in a
long-term, mutually monogamous
relationship*
-persons seeking evaluation or
treatment for a sexually transmitted
disease
-men who have sex with men
Persons at risk for infection by sexual exposure include sex
partners of HBsAg-positive persons, sexually active persons
who are not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relation-
ship (e.g., persons with more than one sex partner during
the previous 6 months), persons seeking evaluation or treat-
ment for a sexually transmitted disease, and men who have
sex with men.
"persons with more than one sex partner
during the previous 6 months
19
Adults at Risk for HBV Infection
• Percutaneous or mucosal exposure to
blood
-current or recent IDU
-household contacts of HBsAg-positive
persons
-residents and staff of facilities for
developmentally disabled persons
-healthcare and public safety workers
with risk for exposure to blood or
blood-contaminated body fluids
-persons with end-stage renal disease
Persons at risk for infection by percutaneous or mucosal
exposure to blood include current or recent injection-drug
users, household contacts of HBsAg-positive persons,
residents and staff of facilities for developmentally disabled
persons, healthcare and public safety workers with risk
for exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids
and persons with end-stage renal disease, including
predialysis, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and home
dialysis patients. Persons with chronic liver disease are
not at increased risk for HBV infection unless they have
percutaneous or mucosal exposure to infectious blood or
body fluids
Adults at Risk for HBV Infection
• Others groups
-international travelers to regions
with high or intermediate levels
(HBsAg prevalence of 2% or higher)
of endemic HBV infection
-persons with HIV infection
Others groups at risk include international travelers to
regions with high or intermediate levels (HBsAg prevalence
of 2% or higher) of endemic HBV infection and persons with
HIV infection.
In settings in which a high proportion of adults have risks
for HBV infection (e.g., sexually transmitted disease/human
immunodeficiency virus testing and treatment facilities, drug-
abuse treatment and prevention settings, healthcare settings
targeting services to IDUs, healthcare settings targeting
services to MSM, and correctional facilities), ACIP recom-
mends universal hepatitis B vaccination for all unvaccinated
adults. In other primary care and specialty medical settings in
which adults at risk for HBV infection receive care, healthcare
providers should inform all patients about the health benefits
of vaccination, including risks for HBV infection and persons
for whom vaccination is recommended, and vaccinate adults
who report risks for HBV infection and any adults requesting
protection from HBV infection. To promote vaccination in all
settings, healthcare providers should implement standing
orders to identify adults recommended for hepatitis B vacci-
nation and administer vaccination as part of routine clinical
services, not require acknowledgment of an HBV infection
risk factor for adults to receive vaccine, and use available
reimbursement mechanisms to remove financial barriers to
hepatitis B vaccination. Additional details about these strate-
gies are available in the December 2006 ACIP statement on
hepatitis B vaccine (see reference list).

Hepatitis B
Twinrix
In 2001, the Food and Drug Administration approved a
combination hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix,
GlaxoSmithKline). Each dose of Twinrix contains 720 ELISA
units of hepatitis A vaccine (equivalent to a pediatric dose
of Havrix), and 20 mcg of hepatitis B surface antigen protein
(equivalent to an adult dose of Engerix-B). The vaccine is
administered in a three-dose series at 0, 1, and 6 months.
Appropriate spacing of the doses must be maintained to
assure long-term protection from both vaccines. The first
and third doses of Twinrix should be separated by at least 6
months. The first and second doses should be separated by
at least 4 weeks, and the second and third doses should be
separated by at least 5 months. In 2007, the FDA approved
an alternative Twinrix schedule of doses at 0, 7, and 21-31
days and a booster dose 12 months after the first dose.
It is not necessary to restart the series or add doses if the
interval between doses is longer than the recommended
interval.
9.
Twinrix is approved for persons aged 18 years and older, and
can be used in persons in this age group with indications
for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines. Because the
hepatitis B component of Twinrix is equivalent to a standard
dose of hepatitis B vaccine, the schedule is the same
whether Twinrix or single-antigen hepatitis B vaccine is used.
Single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine can be used to complete a
series begun with Twinrix and vice versa. See the Hepatitis A
chapter for details.
Serologic Testing of Vaccine Recipients
Prevaccination Serologic Testing
Prevaccination Serologic Testing
The decision to screen potential vaccine recipients for
prior infection depends on the cost of vaccination, the cost
of testing for susceptibility, and the expected prevalence
of immune persons in the population being screened.
Prevaccination testing is recommended for all foreign-born
persons (including immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers,
and internationally adopted children) born in Africa, Asia,
the Pacific Islands, and other regions with high endemicity
of HBV infection (HBsAg prevalence of 2% or higher); for
household, sex, and needle-sharing contacts of HBsAg-
positive persons; men who have sex with men, injection
drug users, and for certain persons receiving cytotoxic
or immunosuppressive therapy. Screening is usually
cost-effective, and should be considered for groups with
a high risk of HBV infection (prevalence of HBV markers
20% or higher), such as men who have sex with men,
injection-drug users, and incarcerated persons. Screening
is usually not cost-effective for groups with a low expected

prevalence of HBV serologic markers, such as health
professionals in their training years.
Serologic testing is not recommended before routine vacci-
nation of infants and children.
Postvaccination Serologic Testing
• Not routinely recommended
following vaccination of infants,
children, adolescents, or most adults
• Recommended for:
-chronic hemodialysis patients
-other immunocompromised persons
-persons with HIV infection
-sex partners of HBsAg+ person
-infants born to HBsAg+ women
-certain healthcare workers
Postvaccination Serologic Testing
Testing for immunity following vaccination is not recom-
mended routinely but should be considered for persons
whose subsequent management depends on knowledge of
their immune status, such as chronic hemodialysis patients,
other immunocompromised persons and persons with HIV
infection. Testing is also recommended for sex partners of
HBsAg-positive persons. When necessary, postvaccination
testing should be performed 1 to 2 months after completion
of the vaccine series.
Infants born to HBsAg-positive women should be tested for
HBsAg and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) after completion
of at least 3 doses of the hepatitis B vaccine series, at age
9 through 18 months (generally at the next well-child visit).
If HBsAg is not present and anti-HBs antibody is present,
children can be considered to be protected.
Postvaccination Serologic Testing
Healthcare personnel who have
contact with patients or blood
should be tested for anti-HBs
(antibody to hepatitis B surface
antigen) 1 to 2 months after
completion of the 3-dose series
Healthcare personnel who have contact with patients
or blood and are at ongoing risk for injuries with sharp
instruments or needlesticks should be routinely tested for
antibody after 1 to 2 months after completion of the 3-dose
series. However, a catch-up program of serologic testing for
healthcare personnel is not recommended. These persons
should be tested as necessary if they have a significant
exposure to HBV (see postexposure prophylaxis section).
Routine postvaccination testing is not recommended for
persons at low risk of exposure, such as public safety
workers and healthcare personnel without direct patient
contact.
Management of Nonresponse to
Hepatitis B Vaccine
• Complete a second series of
three doses
• Should be given on the usual
schedule of 0, 1 and 6 months
• Retest 1-2 months after
completing the second series
Vaccine Nonresponse
Several factors have been associated with nonresponse to
hepatitis B vaccine. These include vaccine factors (e.g., dose,
schedule, injection site) and host factors. Older age (40 years
and older), male sex, obesity, smoking, and chronic illness
have been independently associated with nonresponse to
hepatitis B vaccine. Further vaccination of persons who fail
to respond to a primary vaccination series administered in
the deltoid muscle produces adequate response in 15% to
25% of vaccinees after one additional dose and in 30% to
50% after three additional doses.
Persons who do not respond to the first series of hepatitis B
vaccine should complete a second three-dose vaccine series.
The second vaccine series should be given on the usual 0,
132


## p. 133 (#147) ############################################

Hepatitis B
1, 6-month schedule. A 0, 1, 4-month accelerated schedule
may also be used. Revaccinated healthcare personnel and
others for whom postvaccination serologic testing is recom-
mended should be retested 1 to 2 months after completion
of the second vaccine series.
Persistent Nonresponse to
Hepatitis B Vaccine
• <5% of vaccinees do not develop
anti-HBsAg after 6 valid doses
• May be nonresponder or
"hyporesponder"
• Check HBsAg status
• If exposed, treat as nonresponder
with postexposure prophylaxis
9
Fewer than 5% of persons receiving six doses of hepatitis
B vaccine administered by the appropriate schedule in the
deltoid muscle fail to develop detectable anti-HBs antibody.
Some persons who are anti-HBs negative following six doses
may have a low level of antibody that is not detected by
routine serologic testing (“hyporesponder”). However, one
reason for persistent nonresponse to hepatitis B vaccine is
that the person is chronically infected with HBV. Persons
who fail to develop detectable anti-HBs after six doses
should be tested for HBsAg. Persons who are found to be
HBsAg positive should be counseled accordingly. Persons
who fail to respond to two appropriately administered
three-dose series, and who are HBsAg negative should be
considered susceptible to HBV infection and should be
counseled regarding precautions to prevent HBV infection
and the need to obtain HBIG prophylaxis for any known or
probable parenteral exposure to HBsAg-positive blood (see
the postexposure prophylaxis table in this chapter).
It is difficult to interpret the meaning of a negative anti-HBs
serologic response in a person who received hepatitis B
in the past and was not tested after vaccination. Without
postvaccination testing 1 to 2 months after completion of
the series, it is not possible to determine if persons testing
negative years after vaccination represent true vaccine
failure (i.e., no initial response), or have anti-HBs antibody
that has waned to below a level detectable by the test. The
latter is the most likely explanation, because up to 60% of
vaccinated people lose detectable antibody (but not protec-
tion) 9 to 15 years after vaccination.
One management option is to assume true vaccine failure
and administer a second series to these persons. Serologic
testing for anti-HBs antibody should be repeated 1 to 2
months after the sixth dose.
A second, probably less expensive option is to administer
a single dose of hepatitis B vaccine and test for hepatitis B
surface antibody in 4 to 6 weeks. If the person is anti-HBs
antibody positive, this most likely indicates a booster
response in a previous responder, and no further vaccina-
tion (or serologic testing) is needed. If the person is anti-HBs
antibody negative after this "booster” dose, a second series
should be completed (i.e., two more doses). If the person is
still seronegative after six total doses, he or she should be
managed as a nonresponder (see Postexposure Management,
on the next page).

Hepatitis B
Postexposure Management
Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended as part of the therapy
used to prevent hepatitis B infection following exposure to
HBV. Depending on the exposure circumstance, the hepatitis
B vaccine series may be started at the same time as treat-
ment with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG).
19
HBIG is prepared by cold ethanol fraction of plasma from
selected donors with high anti-HBs titers; it contains an
anti-HBs titer of at least 1:100,000, by RIA. It is used for
passive immunization for accidental (percutaneous, mucous
membrane) exposure, sexual exposure to an HBsAg-positive
person, perinatal exposure of an infant, or household
exposure of an infant younger than 12 months old to a
primary caregiver with acute hepatitis B. Most candidates
for HBIG are, by definition, in a high-risk category and
should therefore be considered for vaccine as well.
Immune globulin (IG) is prepared by cold ethanol fraction-
ation of pooled plasma and contains low titers of anti-HBs.
Because titers are relatively low, IG has no valid current
use for HBV disease unless hepatitis B immune globulin is
unavailable.
Infants born to women who are HBsAg-positive (i.e., acutely
or chronically infected with HBV) are at extremely high risk
of HBV transmission and chronic HBV infection. Hepatitis
B vaccination and one dose of HBIG administered within
24 hours after birth are 85%-95% effective in preventing
both acute HBV infection and chronic infection. Hepatitis
B vaccine administered alone beginning within 24 hours
after birth is 70%-95% effective in preventing perinatal HBV
infection.
HBIG (0.5 mL) should be given intramuscularly (IM), prefer-
ably within 12 hours of birth. Hepatitis B vaccine should be
given IM in three doses. The first dose should be given at the
same time as HBIG, but at a different site. If vaccine is not
immediately available, the first injection should be given
within 7 days of birth. The second and third doses should
be given 1 to 2 months and 6 months, respectively, after the
first. Testing for HBsAg and anti-HBs is recommended at 9
to 18 months of age (3 to 12 months after the third dose) to
monitor the success of therapy. If the mother's HBsAg status
is not known at the time of birth, the infant should be
vaccinated within 12 hours of birth.
HBIG given at birth does not interfere with the administra-
tion of other vaccines administered at 2 months of age.
Subsequent doses of hepatitis B vaccine do not interfere
with the routine pediatric vaccine schedule.
Infants born to HBsAg-positive women and who weigh less
than 2,000 grams at birth should receive postexposure

Hepatitis B
prophylaxis as described above. However, the initial
vaccine dose (at birth) should not be counted in the 3-dose
schedule. The next dose in the series should be admin-
istered when the infant is chronologic age 1 month. The
third dose should be given 1 to 2 months after the second,
and the fourth dose should be given at 6 months of age.
These infants should be tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs at 9
to 18 months of age.
Prevention of Perinatal
Hepatitis B Virus Infection
• Begin treatment within 12 hours
of birth
• Hepatitis B vaccine (first dose)
and HBIG at different sites
• Complete vaccination series at 6
months of age
• Test for response at 9-18 months
of age
9)
Women admitted for delivery whose HBsAg status is
unknown should have blood drawn for testing. While test
results are pending, the infant should receive the first
dose of hepatitis B vaccine (without HBIG) within 12 hours
of birth. If the mother is found to be HBsAg positive, the
infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible but not
later than 7 days of age. If the infant does not receive
HBIG, it is important that the second dose of vaccine be
administered at 1 or 2 months of age.
Preterm infants (less than 2,000 grams birthweight) whose
mother's HBsAg status is unknown should receive hepatitis
B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. If the maternal HBsAg
status cannot be determined within 12 hours of birth
HBIG should also be administered because of the immune
response is less reliable in preterm infants weighing less
than 2,000 grams. As described above, the vaccine dose
administered at birth should not be counted as part of
the series, and the infant should receive three additional
doses beginning at age 1 month.The vaccine series should
be completed by 6 months of age.
Few data are available on the use of Comvax or Pediarix in
infants born to women who have acute or chronic infec-
tion with hepatitis B virus (i.e., HBsAg-positive). Neither
vaccine is licensed for infants whose mothers are known
to be acutely or chronically infected with HBV. However,
ACIP has approved off-label use of Comvax and Pediarix
in children whose mothers are HBsAg positive, or whose
HBsAg status is unknown. Comvax and Pediarix should
never be used in infants younger than 6 weeks of age.
Either vaccine may be administered at the same time as
other childhood vaccines given at 6 weeks of age or older.
After a percutaneous (needle stick, laceration, bite) or
permucosal exposure that contains or might contain HBV,
blood should be obtained from the person who was the
source of the exposure to determine their HBsAg status.
Management of the exposed person depends on the HBsAg
status of the source and the vaccination and anti-HBs
response status of the exposed person. Recommended
postexposure prophylaxis is described in the table on the
next page.

Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a vaccine
component or following a prior dose of hepatitis B vaccine
is a contraindication to further doses of vaccine. Such
allergic reactions are rare.
91
Hepatitis B Vaccine
Contraindications and Precautions
• Severe allergic reaction to a
vaccine component or following
a prior dose
• Moderate or severe acute illness
Persons with moderate or severe acute illness should not
be vaccinated until their condition improves. However, a
minor illness, such as an upper respiratory infection, is not
a contraindication to vaccination.
Specific studies of the safety of hepatitis B vaccine in
pregnant women have not been performed. However, more
than 20 years of experience with inadvertent administration
to pregnant women have not identified vaccine safety issues
for either the woman or the fetus. In contrast, if a pregnant
woman acquires HBV infection, it may cause severe disease
in the mother and chronic infection in the newborn baby.
Therefore, hepatitis B vaccine may be administered to a
pregnant woman who is otherwise eligible for it.
Hepatitis B vaccine does not contain live virus, so it may be
used in persons with immunodeficiency. However, response
to vaccination in such persons may be suboptimal.

1% of adults and 0.4% to 6.4% of children. Serious systemic
adverse reactions and allergic reactions are rarely reported
following hepatitis B vaccine. There is no evidence that
administration of hepatitis B vaccine at or shortly after birth
increases the number of febrile episodes, sepsis evaluations,
or allergic or neurologic events in the newborn period.

British population found a slight increase in risk of MS
among hepatitis B vaccine recipients. However, large popu-
lation-based studies have shown no association between
receipt of hepatitis B vaccine and either the development of
MS or exacerbation of the course of MS is persons already
diagnosed with the disease.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Hepatitis B vaccines should be stored refrigerated at
35°-46°F (2°–8°C), but not frozen. Exposure to freezing
temperature destroys the potency of the vaccine.

Human Papillomavirus
Human Papillomavirus
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually
transmitted infection in the United States. The relationship
of cervical cancer and sexual behavior was suspected for
more than 100 years and was established by epidemiologic
studies in the 1960s. In the early 1980s, cervical cancer cells
were demonstrated to contain HPV DNA. Epidemiologic
studies showing a consistent association between HPV
and cervical cancer were published in the 1990s. The first
vaccine to prevent infection with four types of HPV was
licensed in 2006.

Human Papillomavirus
Human papillomaviruses are small, double-stranded DNA
viruses that infect the epithelium. More than 100 HPV
types have been identified; they are differentiated by the
genetic sequence of the outer capsid protein L1. Most HPV
types infect the cutaneous epithelium and cause common
skin warts. About 40 types infect the mucosal epithelium;
these are categorized according to their epidemiologic
association with cervical cancer. Infection with low-risk,
or nononcogenic types, such as types 6 and 11, can cause
benign or low-grade cervical cell abnormalities, genital
warts and laryngeal papillomas. High-risk, or oncogenic,
HPV types act as carcinogens in the development of cervical
cancer and other anogenital cancers. High-risk types
(currently including types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52,
56, 58, 59, 68, 69, 73, 82) can cause low-grade cervical cell
abnormalities, high-grade cervical cell abnormalities that
are precursors to cancer, and anogenital cancers. High-risk
HPV types are detected in 99% of cervical cancers. Type 16
is the cause of approximately 50% of cervical cancers world-
wide, and types 16 and 18 together account for about 70%
of cervical cancers. Infection with a high-risk HPV type is
considered necessary for the development of cervical cancer,
but by itself it is not sufficient to cause cancer because the
vast majority of women with HPV infection do not develop

In addition to cervical cancer, HPV infection is also associ-

cancer, such as cancer of the vulva, vagina, penis and anus.
The association of genital types of HPV with non-genital
cancers is less well established, but studies support a role
for these HPV types in a subset of oral cavity and pharyngeal

Pathogenesis
HPV infection occurs at the basal epithelium. Although the
incidence of infection is high, most infections resolve spon-
taneously. A small proportion of infected persons become
persistently infected; persistent infection is the most

important risk factor for the development of cervical cancer
precursor lesions. The most common clinically significant
manifestation of persistent genital HPV infection is cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia, or CIN. Within a few years of infec-
tion, low-grade CIN—called CIN 1—may develop, which may
spontaneously resolve and the infection clear.

Persistent HPV infection, however, may progress directly to
high-grade CIN, called CIN2 or CIN3. High-grade abnormali-
ties are at risk of progression to cancer and so are consid-
ered cancer precursors. A small proportion of high-grade
abnormalities spontaneously regress. If left undetected and
untreated, years or decades later CIN2 or 3 can progress to
cervical cancer.
10
Infection with one type of HPV does not prevent infection
with another type. Of persons infected with mucosal HPV,
5% to 30% are infected with multiple types of the virus.
HPV Clinical Features
Clinical Features
Most HPV infections are asymptomatic and result in no
clinical disease. Clinical manifestations of HPV infection
include anogenital warts, recurrent respiratory papilloma-
tosis, cervical cancer precursors (cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia), and cancers, including cervical, anal, vaginal,
vulvar, penile, and some head and neck cancer.

include:
-anogenital warts
- recurrent respiratory papillomatosis
- cervical cancer precursors (cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia)
-cancer (cervical, anal, vaginal, vulvar,
penile, and some head and neck cancer)
Laboratory Diagnosis
HPV has not been isolated in culture. Infection is identified
by detection of HPV DNA from clinical samples. Assays
for HPV detection differ considerably in their sensitivity
and type specificity, and detection is also affected by the
anatomic region sampled as well as the method of specimen
collection.
Currently, only the Digene Hybrid Capture 2® (hc2) High-
Risk HPV DNA Test is approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for clinical use The hc2 uses liquid nucleic
acid hybridization and detects 13 high-risk types (HPV 16,
18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68). Results are
reported as positive or negative and are not type-specific.
The hc2 test is approved for triage of women with equivocal
Papanicolaou (Pap) test results (ASC-US, atypical cells of
undetermined significance) and in combination with the Pap
test for cervical cancer screening in women 30 years of age
and older. The test is not clinically indicated nor approved
for use in men.
Epidemiologic and basic research studies of HPV generally
use nucleic acid amplification methods that generate type-
specific results. The PCR assays used most commonly in
epidemiologic studies target genetically conserved regions in
the L1 gene.

The most frequently used HPV serologic assays are
VLP-based enzyme immunoassays. However, laboratory
reagents used for these assays are not standardized and
there are no standards for setting a threshold for a positive
result.
Medical Management
There is no specific treatment for HPV infection. Medical
management depends on treatment of the specific clinical
manifestation of the infection (such as genital warts or
abnormal cervical cell cytology).

Transmission
HPV is transmitted by direct contact, usually sexual, with an
infected person. Transmission occurs most frequently with
sexual intercourse but can occur following nonpenetrative
sexual activity.
Studies of newly acquired HPV infection demonstrate that
infection occurs soon after onset of sexual activity. In a
prospective study of college women, the cumulative inci-
dence of infection was 40% by 24 months after first sexual
intercourse. HPV 16 accounted for 10.4% of infections.
Genital HPV infection also may be transmitted by nonsexual
routes, but this appears to be uncommon. Nonsexual routes
of genital HPV transmission include transmission from a
woman to a newborn infant at the time of birth.
Temporal Pattern
There is no known seasonal variation in HPV infection.
Communicability
HPV is presumably communicable during the acute infec-
tion and during persistent infection. This issue is difficult
to study because of the inability to culture the virus.
Communicability can presumed to be high because of the
large number of new infections estimated to occur each
year.

Human Papillomavirus
Risk Factors
Risk factors for HPV infection are related to sexual behavior,
including the number of sex partners, lifetime history of
sex partners, and the partners' sexual history. Most studies
suggest that young age (less than 25 years) is a risk factor for
infection. Results of epidemiologic studies are less consistent
for other risk factors, including young age at sexual initia-
tion, inconsistent condom use, number of pregnancies,
genetic factors, smoking, lack of circumcision of male
partner, and oral contraceptive use.

HPV Disease Burden
in the United States
Anogenital HPV is the most common
sexually transmitted infection in the US
-estimated 20 million currently infected
-6.2 million new infections/year
• Common among adolescents and young
adults
More than 80% of sexually active women
will have been infected by age 50
• Infection also common in men
Disease Burden in the United States
Anogenital HPV infection is believed to be the most common
sexually transmitted infection in the United States. An
estimated 20 million persons are currently infected, and an
estimated 6.2 million new HPV infections occur annually.
HPV infection is common among adolescents and young
adults. Prevalence among adolescent girls is as high as 64%.
Up to 75% of new infections occur among persons 15–24
years of age. Modeling estimates suggest that more than 80%
of sexually active women will have been infected by age 50.
.
HPV infection is also common in men. Among heterosexual
men in clinic-based studies, prevalence of genital HPV
infection is often greater than 20%. Prevalence is highly
dependent on the anatomic sites sampled and method of
specimen collection.
Cervical Cancer Disease Burden
In the United States
The American Cancer Society
estimates that in 2008
-11,070 new cervical cancer cases
-3,870 cervical cancer deaths
Almost 100% of these cervical cancer
cases will be caused by one of the 40
HPV types that infect the mucosa
The two most common types of cervical cancer worldwide,
squamous cell carcinoma followed by adenocarcinoma, are
both caused by HPV. The American Cancer Society estimates
that in 2008 about 11,070 new cases of cervical cancer will
be diagnosed in the United States. Approximately 3,870
women will die as a result of cervical cancer. HPV is believed
to be responsible for nearly all of these cases of cervical
cancer. HPV types 16 and 18 are associated with 70% of
these cancers.
In addition to cervical cancer, HPV is believed to be respon-
sible for 90% of anal cancers, 40% of vulvar, vaginal, or
penile cancers, and 12% of oral and pharyngeal cancers.
Population-based estimates, primarily from clinics treating
persons with sexually transmitted infections, indicate
that about 1% of the sexually active adolescent and adult
population in the United States have clinically apparent
genital warts. More than 90% of cases of anogenital warts
are associated with the low-risk HPV types 6 and 11.
About 4 billion dollars are spent annually on management
of sequelae of HPV infections, primarily for the manage-
ment of abnormal cervical cytology and treatment of
cervical neoplasia. This exceeds the economic burden of any

other sexually transmitted infection except human immuno-
deficiency virus.
Prevention
HPV Infection
HPV transmission can be reduced but not eliminated with
the use of physical barriers such as condoms. Recent studies
demonstrated a significant reduction in HPV infection among
young women after initiation of sexual activity when their
partners used condoms consistently and correctly. Abstaining
from sexual activity (i.e., refraining from any genital contact
with another individual) is the surest way to prevent genital
HPV infection. For those who choose to be sexually active, a
monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner is the
strategy most likely to prevent future genital HPV infections.
Cervical Cancer Screening
10
Cervical Cancer Screening
Most cases and deaths from cervical cancer can be prevented
through detection of precancerous changes within the cervix
by cervical cytology using the Pap test. Currently available
Pap test screening can be done by a conventional Pap or a
liquid-based cytology. CDC does not issue recommendations
for cervical cancer screening, but various professional groups
have published recommendations. The American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American Cancer
Society (ACS), and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) guidelines recommend that all women should have
a Pap test for cervical cancer screening within 3 years of
beginning sexual activity or by age 21, whichever occurs first.
While the USPSTF recommends a conventional Pap test at
least every 3 years regardless of age, ACS and ACOG recom-
mend annual or biennial screening of women younger than
age 30, depending on use of conventional or liquid-based
cytology. According to these national organizations, women
over age 30 with three normal consecutive Pap tests should
be screened every 2 to 3 years.
• Cervical cancer screening - no change
-30% of cervical cancers caused by HPV
types not prevented by the quadrivalent
HPV vaccine
- vaccinated females could subsequently
be infected with non-vaccine HPV types
- sexually active females could have been
infected prior to vaccination
Providers should educate women about
the importance of cervical cancer
screening
.
The use of HPV vaccine does not eliminate the need for
continued Pap test screening, since 30% of cervical cancers
are caused by HPV types not included in the vaccine.
Human Papillomavirus Vaccine
Characteristics
Two HPV vaccines are currently licensed in the United States.
Both vaccines are inactivated subunit vaccines. The antigen
for both vaccines is the L1 major capsid protein of HPV,
produced by using recombinant DNA technology. L1 proteins

Quadrivalent HPV (HPV4) vaccine (Gardasil, Merck) was
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in June
2006. The vaccine is approved for females and males 9
through 26 years of age. Each 0.5-ml dose of HPV4 contains
20 ug HPV 6 L1 protein, 40 ug HPV 11 L1 protein, 40 ug HPV
16 L1 protein, and 20 ug HPV 18 L1 protein. The vaccine
antigen is adsorbed on alum adjuvant. The vaccine also
includes sodium chloride, L-histidine, polysorbate 80, and
sodium borate. HPV4 does not contain a preservative or
antibiotic. The vaccine is supplied in single-dose vials and
syringes.
10
Bivalent HPV (HPV2) vaccine (Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline)
was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in
October 2009. The vaccine is approved for females 10
through 25 years of age. HPV2 is not approved for males.
The L1 antigen is adsorbed onto aluminum (as hydroxide
salt). The unique adjuvant system, AS04, is composed of
3-0-desacyl-4'-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adsorbed on
to aluminum (as hydroxide salt). Each 0.5-ml dose contains
20 mcg of HPV type 16 L1 protein, 20 mcg of HPV type 18 L1
protein, 50 mcg of the 3-0-desacyl-4'-monophosphoryl lipid
A (MPL), and 0.5 mg of aluminum hydroxide. The vaccine
also contains sodium chloride and sodium dihydrogen
phosphate dihydrate. HPV2 does not contain a preservative
or antibiotic. It is available in vials and 2 types of prefilled
syringes. One type of prefilled syringe has a tip cap which
may contain natural rubber latex and a plunger which does
not contain latex. The other type has a tip cap and a rubber
plunger which contain dry natural latex rubber. The vial
stopper does not contain latex.

Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy
Both HPV vaccines are highly immunogenic. For both
vaccines more than 99% of recipients develop an antibody
response to HPV types included in the respective vaccines
1 month after completing the three-dose series. However,
there is no known serologic correlative of immunity and no
known minimal titer determined to be protective. The high
efficacy found in the clinical trials to date has precluded
identification of a minimum protective antibody titer.
Further follow-up of vaccinated cohorts may allow determi-
nation of serologic correlates of immunity in the future.
Both HPV vaccines have been found to have high efficacy for
prevention of HPV vaccine type-related persistent infection
and adenocarcinoma in-situ (AIS). Clinical efficacy for HPV4
against cervical disease was determined in two double-
blind, placebo-controlled trials in women 16-26 years of age.
Vaccine efficacy for HPV 16 or 18-related CIN 2/3 or AIS was

97%. Efficacy against any CIN due to HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18
was 95%. HPV4 efficacy against HPV 6, 11, 16 or 18-related
genital warts was 99%. HPV4 efficacy against HPV 6 or
11-related genital warts was 90%.
HPV2 efficacy was evaluated in two randomized, double-
blind, controlled clinical trials in females aged 15 through
25 years. Efficacy against HPV 16 or 18-related CIN grade 2
or 3 or AIS was 93%.

• No evidence of efficacy against

against other vaccine HPV types
Although high efficacy among females without evidence
of infection with vaccine HPV types was demonstrated in
clinical trials of both HPV vaccines, there is no evidence of
efficacy against disease caused by vaccine types with which
participants were infected at the time of vaccination (i.e.,
the vaccines had no therapeutic effect on existing infection
or disease). Participants infected with one or more vaccine
HPV types prior to vaccination were protected against
disease caused by the other vaccine types. Prior infection
with one HPV type did not diminish efficacy of the vaccine
against other vaccine HPV types.
10
The duration of protection following HPV vaccine is not
known. For both vaccines a subset of participants have
been followed for more than 60 months with no evidence
of waning protection. Study populations will continue to be
followed for any evidence of waning immunity.
Routine HPV Vaccination
Recommendations
.
ACIP recommends routine vaccination
of females 11 or 12 years of age
• The vaccination series can be started
as young as 9 years of age at the
clinician's discretion
. Catch-up vaccination recommended for
females 13 through 26 years of age
Vaccination Schedule and Use
ACIP recommends vaccination with HPV2 or HPV4 for
prevention of cervical cancers and precancers. Both vaccines
might provide protection against some other HPV-related
cancers in addition to cervical cancer, although there are
currently only data sufficient to recommend HPV4 for
protection against vulvar and vaginal cancers and precan-
cers. HPV4 is recommended also for prevention of genital
warts.
ACIP recommends routine vaccination of all females 11
or 12 years of age with 3 doses of either HPV2 or HPV4.
The vaccination series can be started beginning at 9 years
of age at the clinician's discretion. Vaccination is recom-
mended for females 13 through 26 years of age who have
not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed
the 3-dose series. If a female reaches age 26 years before
the vaccination series is complete, remaining doses can be
administered after age 26 years.
The 3-dose series of HPV4 may be given to males 9 through
26 years of age to reduce their likelihood of genital warts.
HPV2 is not approved for use in males.
Ideally, vaccine should be administered before potential

exposure to HPV through sexual contact; however, females
who may have already been exposed to HPV should be
vaccinated. Sexually active females who have not been
infected with any of the HPV vaccine types will receive
full benefit from vaccination. Vaccination will provide less
benefit to females if they have already been infected with
one or more of the HPV vaccine types. However, it is not
possible for a clinician to assess the extent to which sexually
active females would benefit from vaccination, and the
risk of HPV infection may continue as long as persons are
sexually active. Pap testing or screening for HPV DNA or HPV
antibody is not recommended prior to vaccination at any
age.
110
HPV Vaccination Schedule
Both HPV vaccines are administered in a three-dose series of
intramuscular injections. The second and third doses should
be administered 2 and 6 months after the first dose. The
third dose should follow the first dose by at least 24 weeks.
An accelerated schedule for HPV vaccine is not recom-
mended.
.
• Routine schedule is 0, 2, 6 months
Third dose should follow the first
dose by at least 24 weeks
An accelerated schedule using
minimum intervals is not
recommend
Series does not need to be restarted
if the schedule is interrupted
.
.
There is no maximum interval between doses. If the HPV
vaccine schedule is interrupted, the vaccine series does
not need to be restarted. If the series is interrupted after
the first dose, the second dose should be given as soon
as possible, and the second and third doses should be
separated by an interval of at least 12 weeks. If only the
third dose is delayed, it should be administered as soon as
possible.
Whenever feasible, the same HPV vaccine should be
used for the entire vaccination series. No studies address
interchangeability of HPV vaccines. However, if the vaccine
provider does not know or have available the HPV vaccine
product previously administered, either HPV vaccine
can be used to complete the series to provide protection
against HPV 16 and 18. For protection against HPV 6 or
11-related genital warts, a vaccination series with less than
3 doses of HPV4 might provide less protection against
genital warts than a complete 3-dose HPV4 series.
HPV vaccine should be administered at the same visit
as other age-appropriate vaccines, such as Tdap and
quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate (MCV4) vaccines.
Administering all indicated vaccines at a single visit
increases the likelihood that adolescents and young adults
will receive each of the vaccines on schedule. Each vaccine
should be administered using a separate syringe at a
different anatomic site.
Females who have an equivocal or abnormal Pap test
could be infected with any of more than 40 high-risk or
low-risk genital HPV types. It is unlikely that such females
would be infected with all HPV vaccine types, and they

may not be infected with any HPV vaccine type. Women
younger than 27 years with a previously abnormal Pap test
may be vaccinated. Women should be advised that data do
not indicate the vaccine will have any therapeutic effect
on existing HPV infection or cervical lesions.
HPV Vaccine
Special Situations
• Vaccine can be administered
-equivocal or abnormal Pap Test
-positive HPV DNA test
-genital warts
-immunosuppression
-breastfeeding
Females who have a positive HPV DNA test (Hybrid Capture
2®) done in conjunction with a Pap test could be infected
with any of 13 high-risk types. This assay does not identify
specific HPV types, and testing for specific HPV types is not
done routinely in clinical practice. Women younger than
27 years with a positive HPV DNA test may be vaccinated.
HPV DNA testing is not a prerequisite for vaccination.
Women should be advised that the vaccine will not have
a therapeutic effect on existing HPV infection or cervical
lesions.
A history of genital warts or clinically evident genital
warts indicate infection with HPV, most often type 6 or 11.
However, these females may be infected with HPV types
other than the HPV4 vaccine types, and therefore they
may receive HPV4 vaccine if they are in the recommended
age group. Women with a history of genital warts should
be advised that data do not indicate HPV4 vaccine will
have any therapeutic effect on existing HPV infection or
genital warts.
10
Because HPV vaccines are subunit vaccines, they can be
administered to females who are immunosuppressed
because of disease or medications. However, the immune
response and vaccine efficacy might be less than that in
persons who are immunocompetent. Women who are
breastfeeding may receive HPV vaccine.

Contraindications and Precautions
Contraindication
- severe allergic reaction to a vaccine

Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a vaccine
component or following a prior dose of HPV vaccine is a
contraindication to receipt of HPV vaccine. A moderate
or severe acute illness is a precaution to vaccination, and
vaccination should be deferred until symptoms of the
acute illness improve. A minor acute illness (e.g., diarrhea
or mild upper respiratory tract infection, with or without
fever) is not a reason to defer vaccination.
HPV Vaccination During Pregnancy
HPV vaccine is not recommended for use during preg-
nancy. The vaccine has not been associated with adverse
pregnancy outcomes or with adverse effects on the
developing fetus. However, data on vaccination during
pregnancy are limited. Initiation of the vaccine series
should be delayed until after completion of the pregnancy.
If a woman is found to be pregnant after initiating the
vaccination series, the remainder of the three-dose
• Initiation of the vaccine series should be
delayed until after completion of pregnancy
• If a woman is found to be pregnant after
initiating the vaccination series, remaining
doses should be delayed until after the
pregnancy
• If a vaccine dose has been administered

intervention
• Women vaccinated during pregnancy
should be reported to the respective

Adverse Reactions Following
Vaccination
The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical
trials of HPV vaccines were local reactions at the site of
injection. In prelicensure clinical trials, local reactions, such
as pain, redness or swelling were reported by 20% to 90%
of recipients. A temperature of 100° F during the 15 days
after vaccination was reported in 10% to 13% of recipients
of either vaccine. A similar proportion of placebo recipients
reported an elevated temperature. Local reactions generally
increased in frequency with increasing doses. However,
reports of fever did not increase significantly with increasing
doses. No serious adverse events have been associated with
either HPV vaccine based on monitoring by CDC and the
Food and Drug Administration.
*similar to reports in placebo recipients
A variety of systemic adverse reactions were reported by
vaccine recipients, including nausea, dizziness, myalgia and
malaise. However, these symptoms occurred with equal
frequency among both vaccine and placebo recipients.
Syncope has been reported among adolescents who received
HPV and other vaccines recommended for this age group
(Tdap, MCV). Recipients should always be seated during
vaccine administration. Clinicians should consider observing
persons for 15-20 minutes after vaccination.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
HPV vaccines should be stored continuously at 35°-46°F
(20–8°C) and should be protected from light. The vaccine
should be removed from refrigeration immediately before
administration. The vaccines must not be exposed to freezing
temperature. Vaccine exposed to freezing temperature
should never be administered.

Influenza
Influenza
.
Influenza
Influenza is a highly infectious viral illness. The name “influ-
enza” originated in 15th century Italy, from an epidemic
attributed to “influence of the stars.” The first pandemic,
or worldwide epidemic, that clearly fits the description of
influenza was in 1580. At least four pandemics of influenza
occurred in the 19th century, and three occurred in the 20th
century. The pandemic of “Spanish” influenza in 1918–1919
caused an estimated 21 million deaths worldwide. The first
pandemic of the 21st century occured in 2009–2010.
Highly infectious viral illness
• First pandemic in 1580
• At least 4 pandemics in 19th century
• Estimated 21 million deaths
worldwide in pandemic of 1918-1919
• Virus first isolated in 1933
Smith, Andrews, and Laidlaw isolated influenza A virus in
ferrets in 1933, and Francis isolated influenza B virus in
1936. In 1936, Burnet discovered that influenza virus could
be grown in embryonated hens' eggs. This led to the study
of the characteristics of the virus and the development of
inactivated vaccines. The protective efficacy of these inac-
tivated vaccines was determined in the 1950s. The first live
attenuated influenza vaccine was licensed in 2003.
Influenza Virus
.
Influenza Virus
Influenza is a single-stranded, helically shaped, RNA virus
of the orthomyxovirus family. Basic antigen types A, B, and
Care determined by the nuclear material. Type A influenza
has subtypes that are determined by the surface antigens
hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Three types of
hemagglutinin in humans (H1, H2, and H3) have a role in
virus attachment to cells. Two types of neuraminidase (N1
and N2) have a role in virus penetration into cells.
Single-stranded RNA virus

Influenza Virus Strains
• Type A
- moderate to severe illness
all age groups
humans and other animals
• Type B
Influenza A causes moderate to severe illness and affects
all age groups. The virus infects humans and other animals.
Influenza A viruses are perpetuated in nature by wild
birds, predominantly waterfowl. Most of these viruses are
not pathogenic to their natural hosts and do not change
or evolve. Influenza B generally causes milder disease
than type A and primarily affects children. Influenza B is
more stable than influenza A, with less antigenic drift and
consequent immunologic stability. It affects only humans.
Influenza C is rarely reported as a cause of human illness,
probably because most cases are subclinical. It has not been
associated with epidemic disease.
- milder disease
: primarily affects children
•Type C
- rarely reported in humans
- no epidemics
Influenza Virus
The nomenclature to describe the type of influenza virus
is expressed in this order: 1) virus type, 2) geographic site
where it was first isolated, 3) strain number, 4) year of isola-
tion, and 5) virus subtype.
Antigenic Changes
Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase periodically change,
apparently due to sequential evolution within immune or
partially immune populations. Antigenic mutants emerge

Influenza
Influenza Antigenic Changes
• Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase
antigens change with time
• Changes occur as a result of point
mutations in the virus gene, or due to
exchange of a gene segment with
another subtype of influenza virus
• Impact of antigenic changes depend
on extent of change (more change
usually means larger impact)
and are selected as the predominant virus to the extent that
they differ from the antecedent virus, which is suppressed
by specific antibody arising in the population as a result of
infection. This cycle repeats continuously. In interpandemic
periods, mutants arise by serial point mutations in the RNA
coding for hemagglutinin. At irregular intervals of 10 to
40 years, viruses showing major antigenic differences from
prevalent subtypes appear and, because the population does
not have protective antibody against these new antigens,
cause pandemic disease in all age groups.
Influenza Antigenic Changes
71
• Antigenic Shift
-major change, new subtype
-caused by exchange of gene
segments
-may result in pandemic
Example of antigenic shift
-H2N2 virus circulated in 1957-1967
-H3N2 virus appeared in 1968 and
completely replaced H2N2 virus
Antigenic shift is a major change in one or both surface
antigens (H or N) that occurs at varying intervals. Antigenic
shifts are probably due to genetic recombination (an
exchange of a gene segment) between influenza A viruses,
usually those that affect humans and birds. An antigenic
shift may result in a worldwide pandemic if the virus is
efficiently transmitted from person to person. The last major
antigenic shift occurred in 1968 when H3N2 (Hong Kong)
influenza appeared. It completely replaced the type A strain
(H2N2, or Asian influenza) that had circulated throughout
the world for the prior 10 years.
Influenza Antigenic Changes
• Antigenic Drift
-minor change, same subtype
-caused by point mutations in gene
-may result in epidemic
• Example of antigenic drift
-in 2002-2003, A/Panama/2007/99
(H3N2) virus was dominant
-AlFujian/411/2002 (H3N2) appeared
in late 2003 and caused widespread
illness in 2003-2004
Antigenic drift is a minor change in surface antigens that
results from point mutations in a gene segment. Antigenic
drift may result in an epidemic, since the protection that
remains from past exposures to similar viruses is incomplete.
Drift occurs in all three types of influenza virus (A,B,C). For
instance, during most of the 1997–1998 influenza season, A/
Wuhan/359/95 (H3N2) was the predominant influenza strain
isolated in the United States. A/Wuhan was a drifted distant
relative of the 1968 Hong Kong H3N2 strain. In the last half
of the 1997–1998 influenza season, a drifted variant of A/
Wuhan appeared. This virus, named A/Sydney/5/97, was
different enough from A/Wuhan (which had been included
in the 1997–1998 vaccine) that the vaccine did not provide
much protection. Both A/Wuhan and A/Sydney circulated
late in the 1997–1998 influenza season. A/Sydney became
the predominant strain during the 1998–1999 influenza
season and was included in the 1998–1999 vaccine.

Since the late 19th century, four occurrences of antigenic
shifts have led to major pandemics (1889–1891, 1918–1920,
1957-1958, and 1968–1969). A pandemic starts from a
single focus and spreads along routes of travel. Typically,
there are high attack rates involving all age groups, and
mortality is usually markedly increased. Severity is gener-
ally not greater in the individual patient (except for the
1918–1919 strain), but because large numbers of persons
are infected, the number, if not the proportion, of severe
and fatal cases will be large. Onset may occur in any season
of the year. Secondary and tertiary waves may occur every
period of 1-2 years, usually in the winter.

Influenza
In April 2009, a novel influenza A-H1N1 virus appeared and
quickly spread across North America. By May 2009 the virus
had spread to many areas of the world. Influenza morbidity
caused by 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus remained above
seasonal baselines throughout spring and summer 2009 and
was the cause of the first influenza pandemic since 1968.
In the United States, the pandemic was characterized by
a substantial increase in influenza activity that was well
beyond historical norms. Influenza activity peaked in late
October 2009, and returned to the seasonal baseline by
January 2010. During this time, more than 99 percent of
viruses characterized were the 2009 pandemic influenza
A- H1N1 virus.
11
CDC estimates that pandemic H1N1 influenza virus caused
more than 60 million Americans to become ill, and led to
more than 270,000 hospitalizations and 12,500 deaths.
Ninety percent of hospitalizations and deaths occurred in
persons younger than 65 years of age. With typical seasonal
influenza approximately 90% of deaths occur in persons
older than 65 years.
In response to the pandemic a monovalent influenza
vaccine was produced and deployed in a nationwide vacci-
nation campaign.
Typically in an epidemic, influenza attack rates are
lower than in pandemics. There is usually a rise in excess
mortality. The major impact is observed in morbidity, with
high attack rates and excess rates of hospitalization, espe-
cially for adults with respiratory disease. Absenteeism from
work and school is high, and visits to healthcare providers
increase. In the Northern Hemisphere, epidemics usually
occur in late fall and continue through early spring. In the
Southern Hemisphere, epidemics usually occur 6 months
before or after those in the Northern Hemisphere.
Influenza Pathogenesis
.
Sporadic outbreaks can occasionally be localized to families,
schools, and isolated communities.
• Respiratory transmission of virus
Replication in respiratory
epithelium with subsequent
destruction of cells
• Viremia rarely documented
• Viral shedding in respiratory
secretions for 5-10 days
Pathogenesis
Following respiratory transmission, the virus attaches to
and penetrates respiratory epithelial cells in the trachea
and bronchi. Viral replication occurs, which results in the
destruction of the host cell. Viremia has rarely been docu-
mented. Virus is shed in respiratory secretions for 5–10 days.
Influenza Clinical Features
Clinical Features
The incubation period for influenza is usually 2 days,
but can vary from 1 to 4 days. The severity of influenza
illness depends on the prior immunologic experience with
antigenically related virus variants. In general, only about

Influenza
50% of infected persons will develop the classic clinical
symptoms of influenza.
“Classic” influenza disease is characterized by the abrupt
onset of fever, myalgia, sore throat, nonproductive cough,
and headache. The fever is usually 101°-102°F, and
accompanied by prostration. The onset of fever is often
so abrupt that the exact hour is recalled by the patient.
Myalgias mainly affect the back muscles. Cough is believed
to be a result of tracheal epithelial destruction. Additional
symptoms may include rhinorrhea (runny nose), headache,
substernal chest burning and ocular symptoms (e.g., eye
pain and sensitivity to light).
Systemic symptoms and fever usually last from 2 to 3 days,
rarely more than 5 days. They may be decreased by such
medications as aspirin or acetaminophen. Aspirin should
not be used for infants, children, or teenagers because they
may be at risk for contracting Reye syndrome following an
influenza infection. Recovery is usually rapid, but some
patients may have lingering depression and asthenia (lack of
strength or energy) for several weeks.
Influenza Complications
• Pneumonia
-secondary bacterial
-primary influenza viral
• Reye syndrome
• Myocarditis
• Death 0.5-1 per 1,000 cases
Complications
The most frequent complication of influenza is pneumonia,
most commonly secondary bacterial pneumonia (e.g.,
Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or
Staphylococcus aureus). Primary influenza viral pneumonia
is an uncommon complication with a high fatality rate. Reye
syndrome is a complication that occurs almost exclusively
in children taking aspirin, primarily in association with
influenza B (or varicella zoster), and presents with severe
vomiting and confusion, which may progress to coma due to
swelling of the brain.
Other complications include myocarditis (inflammation of
the heart) and worsening of chronic bronchitis and other
chronic pulmonary diseases. Death is reported in 0.5–1 per
1,000 cases. The majority of deaths occur among persons 65
years of age and older.
Impact of Influenza
An increase in mortality typically accompanies an influenza
epidemic. Increased mortality results not only from influ-
enza and pneumonia but also from cardiopulmonary and
other chronic diseases that can be exacerbated by influenza.
Impact of Influenza-United States,
1976-2007
• The number of influenza-associated deaths
varies substantially by year, influenza virus
type and subtype, and age group
• Annual influenza-associated deaths ranged
from 3,349 (1985-86 season) to 48,614
(2003-04 season), with an average of 23,607
annual deaths
• Persons 65 years of age and older account
for approximately 90% of deaths
2.7 times more deaths occurred during
seasons when A(H3N2) viruses were
prominent
The number of influenza-associated deaths varies substan-
tially by year, influenza virus type and subtype, and age
group. In a study of influenza seasons from 1976-77 through
2006-07, the estimated number of annual influenza-
associated deaths from respiratory and circulatory causes
ranged from a low of 3,349 (1985-86 season) to a high of

48,614 (2003-04 season), with an average of 23,607 annual
influenza-associated deaths. Persons 65 years of age and
older account for approximately 90% of deaths attributed to
pneumonia and influenza. During seasons with prominent
circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses, 2.7 times more
deaths occurred than during seasons when A(H3N2) viruses
were not prominent.
• Highest rates of complications and
hospitalization among young children
and person >65 years
• Average of >200,000 influenza-related
excess hospitalizations
• 57% of hospitalizations among
persons <65 years of age
• Greater number of hospitalizations
during type A (H3N2) epidemics
The risk for complications and hospitalizations from influ-
enza are higher among persons 65 years of age and older,
young children, and persons of any age with certain under-
lying medical conditions. An average of more than 200,000
hospitalizations per year are related to influenza, more than
57% of which are among persons younger than 65 years. A
greater number of hospitalizations occur during years that
influenza A (H3N2) is predominant. In nursing homes, attack
rates may be as high as 60%, with fatality rates as high as
30%. The cost of a severe epidemic has been estimated to be
$12 billion.
Among children 044 years of age, hospitalization rates have
varied from 100 per 100,000 healthy children to as high
as 500 per 100,000 for children with underlying medical
conditions. Hospitalization rates for children 24 months of
age and younger are comparable to rates for persons 65
and older. Children 24-59 months of age are at less risk of
hospitalization from influenza than are younger children,
but are at increased risk for influenza-associated clinic and
emergency department visits.

Healthy children 5 through 18 years of age are not at

community outbreaks of influenza. They also serve as a
major source of transmission of influenza within communi-
ties. Influenza has a substantial impact among school-aged
children and their contacts. These impacts include school
absenteeism, medical care visits, and parental work loss.
Studies have documented 5 to 7 influenza-related outpa-
tient visits per 100 children annually, and these children
frequently receive antibiotics.

Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of influenza is usually suspected on the basis
of characteristic clinical findings, particularly if influenza
has been reported in the community.
Influenza Diagnosis
Virus can be isolated from throat and nasopharyngeal
swabs obtained within 3 days of onset of illness. Culture is
performed by inoculation of the amniotic or allantoic sac
of chick embryos or certain cell cultures that support viral
replication. A minimum of 48 hours is required to demon-
strate virus, and 1 to 2 additional days to identify the virus
Clinical and epidemiological
characteristics
• Isolation of influenza virus from
clinical specimen (e.g., nasopharynx,
throat, sputum)
• Significant rise in influenza IgG by

Influenza
type. As a result, culture is helpful in defining the etiology of
local epidemics, but not in individual case management.
Serologic confirmation of influenza requires demonstration of
a significant rise in influenza IgG. The acute-phase specimen
should be taken less than 5 days from onset, and a convales-
cent specimen taken 10–21 days (preferably 21 days) following
onset. Complement fixation (CF) and hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) are the serologic tests most commonly used.
The key test is HI, which depends on the ability of the virus to
agglutinate human or chicken erythrocytes and inhibition of
this process by specific antibody. Diagnosis requires at least
a fourfold rise in antibody titer. Rapid diagnostic testing for
influenza antigen permits those in office and clinic settings
to assess the need for antiviral use in a more timely manner.

able on the CDC influenza website at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/

Epidemiology
Occurrence
Influenza occurs throughout the world.
Influenza Epidemiology
Reservoir
Humans are the only known reservoir of influenza types B
and C. Influenza A may infect both humans and animals.
There is no chronic carrier state.
• Reservoir
Human, animals
(type A only)
• Transmission Respiratory
Probably airborne
• Temporal pattern Peak December - March
in temperate climate
May occur earlier or later
• Communicability 1 day before to 5 days
after onset (adults)
Transmission
Influenza is primarily transmitted from person to person via
large virus-laden droplets (particles more than 5 microns
in diameter) that are generated when infected persons
cough or sneeze. These large droplets can then settle on
the mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tracts of
susceptible persons who are near (within 3 feet) infected
persons. Transmission may also occur through direct contact
or indirect contact with respiratory secretions such as when
touching surfaces contaminated with influenza virus and
then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
Temporal Pattern
Influenza activity peaks from December to March in
temperate climates, but may occur earlier or later. During
1976–2008, peak influenza activity in the United States
occurred most frequently in January (19% of seasons) and
February (47% of seasons). However, peak influenza activity

Secular Trends in the United States
There is a documented association between influenza
and increased morbidity in high-risk adult populations.
Hospitalization for adults with high-risk medical conditions
increases two-to fivefold during major epidemics.
11
The impact of influenza in the United States is quantified
by measuring pneumonia and influenza (P and I) deaths.
Death certificate data are collected from 122 U.S. cities with
populations of more than 100,000 (total of approximately
70,000,000). P and I deaths include all deaths for which
pneumonia is listed as a primary or underlying cause or for
which influenza is listed on the death certificate.

An expected ratio of deaths due to P and I compared with
all deaths for a given period of time is determined. The
epidemic threshold for influenza seasons is generally esti-
mated at 1.645 standard deviations above observed P and

during influenza outbreaks. Influenza epidemic activity is
signaled when the ratio of deaths due to P and I exceeds the
threshold ratio for 2 consecutive weeks.

Influenza
Influenza Vaccine
Characteristics
Two types of influenza vaccine are available in the United
States. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) has
been available since the 1940s. TIV is administered by the
intramuscular route and currently contains three inactivated
viruses: type A (H1N1), type A (H3N2), and type B. Only
split-virus and subunit inactivated vaccines are available
in the United States. Vaccine viruses are grown in chicken
eggs, and the final product contains residual egg protein.
The vaccine is available in both pediatric (0.25-ml dose) and
adult (0.5-ml dose) formulations.
Multiple manufacturers produce inactivated influenza
vaccine each year for the U.S. market. Vaccines are available
in multiple presentations (single dose syringes and vials,
multi-dose vials) and in preservative-free formulations.
Approved age indications vary by manufacturer and product.
Clinicians should obtain inactivated influenza vaccine
appropriate for the age groups they plan to vaccinate. ACIP
does not recommend use of influenza vaccine outside the
vaccine's FDA-approved age indication. Tables listing each
years influenza vaccines are available in the annual ACIP
influenza statement, and on the CDC influenza website at
http://www.cdc.gov/flu/.
Influenza Vaccines
• Inactivated subunit (TIV)
-intramuscular
-trivalent
• Live attenuated vaccine (LAIV)
-intranasal
-trivalent
In 2009 the Food and Drug Administration approved a new
formulation of inactivated influenza vaccine produced by
sanofi pasteur, brand name Fluzone High Dose. This vaccine
is approved only for persons 65 years of age or older. Each
dose of this vaccine contains 4 times as much hemagglutinin
as the regular formulation of Fluzone for adults. A clinical
trial of this vaccine among persons 65 years and older
demonstrated a higher rate of seroconversion and higher
titer of influenza antibody against type A influenza, but not
against type B influenza. ACIP has not expressed a prefer-
ence for the high dose Fluzone formulation or any other
inactivated vaccine for use in persons 65 years and older.
Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was approved for
use in the United States in 2003. It contains the same three
influenza viruses as TIV. The viruses are cold-adapted, and
replicate effectively in the mucosa of the nasopharynx.
The vaccine viruses are grown in chicken eggs, and the
final product contains residual egg protein. The vaccine is
provided in a single-dose sprayer unit; half of the dose is
sprayed into each nostril. LAIV does not contain thimerosal
or any other preservative. LAIV is approved for use only in
healthy, nonpregnant persons 2 through 49 years of age.
Vaccinated children can shed vaccine viruses in nasopharyn-
geal secretions for up to 3 weeks. One instance of transmis-
sion of vaccine virus to a contact has been documented.

Influenza
The transmitted virus retained its attenuated, cold-adapted,
temperature-sensitive characteristics. The frequency of
shedding of vaccine strains by persons 5-49 years of age has
not been determined.
Transmission of LAIV Virus
• LAIV replicates in the nasopharyngeal
mucosa
• Mean shedding of virus 7.6 days - longer
in children
• One instance of transmission of vaccine
virus documented in a child care setting
• Transmitted virus retained attenuated,
cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive
characteristics
• No transmission of LAIV reported in the
U.S.
Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy
Inactivated Influenza
Vaccine Efficacy
TIV
For practical purposes, immunity following inactivated influ-
enza vaccination is less than 1 year because of waning of
vaccine-induced antibody and antigenic drift of circulating
influenza viruses. Influenza vaccine efficacy varies by the
similarity of the vaccine strain(s) to the circulating strain
and the age and health status of the recipient. Vaccines
are effective in protecting up to 90% of healthy vaccinees
younger than 65 years of age from illness when the vaccine
strain is similar to the circulating strain. However, the
vaccine is only 30% 40% effective in preventing illness
among persons 65 years of age and older.
• 70%-90% effective among healthy
persons <65 years of age
• 30%-40% effective among frail
elderly persons
• 50%-60% effective in preventing
hospitalization
• 80% effective in preventing death

Although the vaccine is not highly effective in preventing
clinical illness among the elderly, it is effective in preventing
complications and death. Among elderly persons, the
vaccine is 50%-60% effective in preventing hospitalization
and 80% effective in preventing death. During a 1982–1983
influenza outbreak in Genesee County, Michigan, unvac-
cinated nursing home residents were four times more likely
to die than were vaccinated residents.

well matched, efficacy was 87% against culture-confirmed
influenza. In year 2, when the type A component was not
well matched between vaccine and circulating virus strains,
efficacy was also 87%. Other results from this trial included a
27% reduction in febrile otitis media and a 28% reduction in
otitis media with concomitant antibiotic use. Receipt of LAIV
also resulted in decreased fever and otitis media in vaccine
recipients who developed influenza.
LAIV Efficacy in Healthy
Children

confirmed influenza in children
5-7 years old
27% reduction in febrile otitis media

LAIV Efficacy in
Healthy Adults
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among
3,920 healthy working adults aged 18-49 years assessed
several endpoints and documented reductions in illness,
absenteeism, healthcare visits, and medication use during
influenza outbreak periods. This study was conducted
during the 1997-98 influenza season, when the vaccine
and circulating type A strains were not well matched. This
• 20% fewer severe febrile illness
episodes
• 24% fewer febrile upper respiratory
illness episodes
• 27% fewer lost work days due to
febrile upper respiratory illness
• 18%-37% fewer days of healthcare
provider visits due to febrile illness
• 41%-45% fewer days of antibiotic use

study did not include laboratory virus testing of cases. Three
studies among children have demonstrated greater efficacy
for LAIV compared to TIV. There is no evidence in adults that
efficacy of LAIV is greater than that of TIV.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
TIV
Influenza activity peaks in temperate areas between late
December and early March. TIV should be offered as soon as
it becomes available.
Inactivated Influenza Vaccine
Recommendations
• Advisory Committee on unization
Practices recommends annual
influenza vaccination for all persons 6
months of age and older
• Protection of persons at higher risk
for influenza-related complications
should continue to be a focus of
vaccination efforts as providers and
programs transition to routine
vaccination of all persons aged 6
months and older
Organized vaccination campaigns generally should be
scheduled no earlier than mid-October. Vaccine may be
given up to and even after influenza activity is documented
in a region. Although most influenza vaccination activities
should be completed by December (particularly for high-
risk groups), providers should continue to provide vaccine
throughout influenza season.
One dose of TIV may be administered annually for persons
9 years of age or older. Children 6 months through 8 years
of age receiving influenza vaccine for the first time should
receive two doses administered at least 1 month apart.
For the 2010-2011 influenza season a second dose of
seasonal influenza vaccine was recommended for children
6 months through 8 years of age who received no doses of
2009 monovalent H1N1 vaccine regardless of the number of
doses of seasonal vaccine received in prior years.
Inactivated influenza vaccine should be given by the intra-
muscular (IM) route. Other methods, such as intradermal,
subcutaneous, topical, or mucosal should not be used unless
approved by the Food and Drug Administration or recom-
mended by ACIP.

older, with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts
of children aged younger than 6 months; and
household contacts and caregivers of persons with
medical conditions that put them at higher risk for
severe complications from influenza.
Pregnancy and Inactivated
Influenza Vaccine
Case reports and limited studies suggest that pregnant
women may be at increased risk for serious medical
complications of influenza as a result of increases in heart
rate, stroke volume and oxygen consumption; decreases
in lung capacity; and changes in immunologic function. A
study found that the risk of hospitalization for influenza-
related complications was more than four times higher
for women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy
than for nonpregnant women. The risk of complications
for these pregnant women was comparable to that for
• Risk of hospitalization 4 times higher
than nonpregnant women
• Risk of complications comparable to
nonpregnant women with high-risk
medical conditions
Vaccination (with TIV) recommended
if pregnant during influenza season
• Vaccination can occur during any
trimester

nonpregnant women with high-risk medical conditions,
for whom influenza vaccine has been traditionally recom-
mended.
ACIP recommends vaccination of women who will be
pregnant during influenza season. Vaccination can occur
during any trimester. Influenza season in the United States
generally occurs in December through March. Only TIV
should be administered to pregnant women.
HIV Infection and Inactivated
Influenza Vaccine
Available data suggest that persons with HIV infection may
have prolonged influenza illnesses and are at increased
risk of complications of influenza. Many persons with HIV
infection will develop protective antibody titers following
inactivated influenza vaccine. In persons who have
advanced HIV disease and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell
counts, TIV vaccine may not induce protective antibody
titers. A second dose of vaccine does not improve the
immune response in these persons.
• Persons with HIV at increased risk
of complications of influenza
• TIV induces protective antibody
titers in many HIV-infected persons
• Transient increase in HIV replication
reported
• TIV will benefit many HIV-infected
persons
11
Some studies have demonstrated a transient increase in
viral titer in the blood of vaccinated persons infected with
HIV. There is no evidence of deterioration in CD4 counts or
progression of clinical HIV disease. Because influenza can
result in serious illness and complications and because influ-
enza vaccination may result in protective antibody titers,
ACIP believes that influenza vaccination will benefit many
persons with HIV infection. LAIV should not be administered
to persons with HIV infection.
Efforts should be made to vaccinate household and
other close contacts of high-risk persons. These include
healthcare personnel, employees of long-term care facili-
ties, and household contacts of high-risk persons. These
individuals may be younger and healthier and more likely
to be protected from illness than are elderly persons. All
healthcare providers should receive annual inactivated
influenza vaccine. Groups that should be targeted include
physicians, nurses, and other personnel in hospitals
and outpatient settings who have contact with high-risk
patients in all age groups, and providers of home care to
high-risk persons (e.g., visiting nurses, volunteers). LAIV
may be administered to healthy healthcare personnel 49
years of age or younger, except those who have contact
with severely immunosuppressed persons who require
hospitalization and care in a protective environment (i.e.,
in isolation because of severe immunosuppression).
LAIV
LAIV is approved for healthy, nonpregnant persons 2
through 49 years of age. The vaccine can be administered
to eligible persons as soon as it becomes available in the

influenza season. One dose of LAIV may be administered
by the intranasal route to persons 9 through 49 years of
age. Children 2 through 8 years of age receiving influenza
vaccine for the first time should receive two doses adminis-
tered at least 4 weeks apart.
During the 2010-2011 influenza season a second dose of

contact with severely immunosuppressed persons who are
hospitalized and receiving care in a protected environment
should not receive LAIV.
Simultaneous Administration of
LAIV and Other Vaccines
Inactivated vaccines do not interfere with the immune
response to live vaccines. Inactivated vaccines, such as
tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, can be administered either
simultaneously or at any time before or after LAIV. Other
live vaccines can be administered on the same day as LAIV.
Live vaccines not administered on the same day should be
administered at least 4 weeks apart when possible.

vaccinated until their symptoms have decreased. A history
of Guillian Barre' syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks following
a previous dose of influenza vaccine is a precaution for TIV.
Pregnancy, breastfeeding, and immunosuppression are not
contraindications to inactivated influenza vaccination.

Contraindications and Precautions
• Children <2 years of age*
• Persons 250 years of age*
• Persons with chronic medical
conditions*
• Children and adolescents
receiving long-term aspirin
therapy*
'These persons should receive inactivated influenza vaccine
LAIV
Persons who should not receive LAIV include children
younger than 2 years of age; persons 50 years of age and
older; persons with chronic medical conditions, including
asthma, a recent wheezing episode, reactive airways disease
or other chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular conditions,
metabolic disease such as diabetes, renal disease, or
hemoglobinopathy, such as sickle cell disease; and children
or adolescents receiving long-term therapy with aspirin
or other salicylates, because of the association of Reye
syndrome with wild-type influenza infection. Persons in
these groups should receive inactivated influenza vaccine.
Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine
Contraindications and Precautions
• Immunosuppression from any cause*
• Pregnant women*
• Severe (anaphylactic) allergy to egg or
other vaccine components
• History of Guillian Barre' syndrome within
6 weeks following a previous dose of
influenza vaccine
• Children younger than 5 years with
recurrent wheezing*
• Moderate or severe acute illness
As with other live-virus vaccines, LAIV should not be given
to persons who are immunosuppressed because of disease,
including HIV, or who are receiving immunosuppres-
sive therapy. Pregnant women should not receive LAIV.
Immunosuppressed persons and pregnant women should
receive inactivated influenza vaccine. Since LAIV contains
residual egg protein, it should not be administered to
persons with a history of severe allergy to egg or any other
vaccine component. A history of Guillian Barre' syndrome
(GBS) within 6 weeks following a previous dose of influenza
vaccine is a precaution for LAIV.
*These persons should receive inactivated influenza vaccine
As with all vaccines, LAIV should be deferred for persons
with a moderate or severe acute illness. If clinical judgment
indicates that nasal congestion might impede delivery of the
vaccine to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, deferral of administra-
tion should be considered until the condition has improved.
The effect on safety and efficacy of LAIV coadministration
with influenza antiviral medications has not been studied.
However, because influenza antiviral agents reduce replica-
tion of influenza viruses, LAIV should not be administered
until 48 hours after cessation of influenza antiviral therapy,
and influenza antiviral medications should not be adminis-
tered for 2 weeks after receipt of LAIV.
Adverse Reactions Following
Vaccination
TIV
Local reactions are the most common adverse reactions
following vaccination with TIV. Local reactions include
soreness, erythema, and induration at the site of injection.

These reactions are transient, generally lasting 1 to 2 days.

Nonspecific systemic symptoms, including fever, chills, malaise,
and myalgia, are reported in fewer than 1% of TIV recipients.
These symptoms usually occur in those with no previous
exposure to the viral antigens in the vaccine. They usually
occur within 6–12 hours of TIV vaccination and last 1-2 days.
Recent reports indicate that these systemic symptoms are no
more common than in persons given a placebo injection.
Fever, malaise
Allergic reactions
Neurological
reactions
very rare
111
Rarely, immediate hypersensitivity, presumably allergic,
reactions (such as hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, or
systemic anaphylaxis) occur after vaccination with TIV. These
reactions probably result from hypersensitivity to a vaccine
component. The majority are most likely related to residual
egg protein. Although current influenza vaccines contain
only a small quantity of egg protein, this protein may
induce immediate allergic reactions in persons with severe
egg allergy. Persons who have developed hives, had swelling
of the lips or tongue, or have experienced acute respira-
tory distress or collapse after eating eggs should consult a
physician for appropriate evaluation to assist in determining
whether influenza vaccination may proceed or should be
deferred. Persons with documented immunoglobulin E
(19E)-mediated hypersensitivity to eggs—including those who
have had occupational asthma or other allergic responses
from exposure to egg protein—may also be at increased risk
for reactions from influenza vaccines, and similar consulta-
tion should be considered. Protocols have been published
for influenza vaccination of patients who have egg allergies
and medical conditions that place them at increased risk for
influenza infection or its complications.
The potential exists for hypersensitivity reactions to
any vaccine component. Although exposure to vaccines
containing thimerosal can lead to induction of hypersensi-
tivity, most patients do not develop reactions to thimerosal
administered as a component of vaccines, even when patch
or intradermal tests for thimerosal indicate hypersensitivity.
When it has been reported, hypersensitivity to thimerosal
has usually consisted of local delayed-type hypersensitivity
reactions.
Unlike the 1976 swine influenza vaccine, subsequent
inactivated vaccines prepared from other virus strains have
not been clearly associated with an increased frequency of
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). However, obtaining a precise
estimate of a small increase in risk is difficult for a rare
condition such as GBS, which has an annual background
incidence of only one to two cases per 100,000 adult popu-
lation. Among persons who received the swine influenza
vaccine in 1976, the rate of GBS exceeded the background
rate by less than one case per 100,000 vaccinations. Even
165


## p. 166 (#180) ############################################

Influenza
if GBS were a true adverse reaction in subsequent years,
the estimated risk for GBS was much lower than one per
100,000. Further, the risk is substantially less than that
for severe influenza or its complications, which could be
prevented by vaccination, especially for persons aged 65
years or older and those with a medical indication for
influenza vaccine.
Although the incidence of GBS in the general population is
very low, persons with a history of GBS have a substantially
greater likelihood of subsequently developing GBS than do
persons without such a history, irrespective of vaccination.
As a result, the likelihood of coincidentally developing GBS
after influenza vaccination is expected to be greater among
persons with a history of GBS than among persons with
no history of GBS. Whether influenza vaccination might be
causally associated with this risk for recurrence is not known.
It seems prudent for persons known to have developed GBS
within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination to avoid
subsequent influenza vaccination. For most persons with a
history of GBS who are at high risk for severe complications
from influenza, the established benefits of influenza vaccina-
tion justify yearly vaccination.
Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine
Adverse Reactions
• Children
- no significant increase in URI symptoms, fever, or
other systemic symptoms
- significantly increased risk of asthma or reactive
airways disease in children 12-59 months of age
• Adults
-significantly increased rate of cough, runny nose,
nasal congestion, sore throat, and chills reported
among vaccine recipients
-no increase in the occurrence of fever
• No serious adverse reactions identified
LAIV
Among children the most common adverse reactions are
runny nose and headaches. However, there have been no
significant differences between LAIV and placebo recipients
in the proportion with these symptoms. In a clinical trial,
children 6–23 months of age had an increased risk of
wheezing. An increased risk of wheezing was not reported in
older children.
Among healthy adults, a significantly increased rate of
cough, runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, and chills
was reported among vaccine recipients. These symptoms
were reported in 10% 40% of vaccine recipients, a rate
3%-10% higher than reported for placebo recipients. There
was no increase in the occurrence of fever among vaccine
recipients. No serious adverse reactions have been identified
in LAIV recipients, either children or adults.
No instances of Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported
among LAIV recipients. However the number of persons
vaccinated to date is too small to identify such a rare vaccine
adverse reaction.
Few data are available concerning the safety of LAIV among
persons at high risk for development of complications of
influenza, such as immunosuppressed persons or those with
chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease. Until additional data
are available, persons at high risk of complications of influ-
enza should not receive LAIV. These persons should continue
to receive inactivated influenza vaccine.

Influenza
Vaccine Storage and Handling
TIV
Inactivated influenza vaccine is generally shipped in an insu-
lated container with coolant packs. CDC recommends that
the vaccine be stored at refrigerator temperature (35°-46°F
[2–8°C]). Inactivated influenza vaccine must not be frozen.
Opened multidose vials may be used until the expiration
date printed on the package if no visible contamination is
present.
LAN
LAIV should be stored at refridgerator temperature (35°– 46°
F (29–8°C]). LAIV inadvertently exposed to freezing tempera-
ture should be placed at refrigerator temperature and used
as soon as possible.
111
LAIV is intended for intranasal administration only and
should never be administered by injection. LAIV is supplied
in a prefilled single-use sprayer containing 0.2 mL of vaccine.
Approximately 0.1 ml (i.e., half of the total sprayer contents)
is sprayed into the first nostril while the recipient is in the
upright position. An attached dose-divider clip is removed
from the sprayer to administer the second half of the dose
into the other nostril. If the vaccine recipient sneezes after
administration, the dose should not be repeated.
Influenza Vaccine
Strategies to Improve Coverage
Strategies for Improving Influenza
Vaccine Coverage
On average, fewer than 20% of persons in high-risk groups
receive influenza vaccine each year. This points to the
need for more effective strategies for delivering vaccine to
high-risk persons, their healthcare providers, and household
contacts. Persons for whom the vaccine is recommended can
be identified and immunized in a variety of settings.
• Ensure systematic and automatic
offering of TIV to high-risk groups
• Educate healthcare providers and
patients
• Address concerns about adverse
events
• Emphasize physician
recommendation
In physicians' offices and outpatient clinics, persons who
should receive inactivated influenza vaccine should be iden-
tified and their charts marked. TIV use should be promoted,
encouraged and recommended beginning in October and
continuing through the influenza season. Those without
regularly scheduled visits should receive reminders.
In nursing homes and other residential long-term care facili-
ties, immunization with TIV should be routinely provided to
all residents at one period of time immediately preceding
the influenza season; consent should be obtained at the
time of admission.
In acute care hospitals and continuing care centers, persons
for whom vaccine is recommended who are hospitalized
167


## p. 168 (#182) ############################################

Influenza
from October through March should be vaccinated prior to
discharge. In outpatient facilities providing continuing care
to high-risk patients (e.g., hemodialysis centers, hospital
specialty-care clinics, outpatient rehabilitation programs),
all patients should be offered TIV shortly before the onset of
the influenza season.
Visiting nurses and others providing home care to high-risk
persons should identify high-risk patients and administer
TIV in the home, if necessary.
In facilities providing services to persons 50 years of age
and older (e.g., retirement communities, recreation centers),
inactivated influenza vaccine should be offered to all
unvaccinated residents or attendees on site. Education and
publicity programs should also be conducted in conjunction
with other interventions.
11
For travelers, indications for influenza vaccine should be
reviewed prior to travel and vaccine offered, if appropriate.
Administrators of all of the above facilities and organiza-
tions should arrange for influenza vaccine to be offered
to all personnel before the influenza season. Additionally,
household members of high-risk persons and others
with whom they will be in contact should receive written
information about why they should receive the vaccine and
where to obtain it.
Antiviral Agents for Influenza
In the United States, four antiviral agents are approved for
preventing or treating influenza: amantadine, rimantadine,
zanamivir, and oseltamivir.
Influenza Antiviral Agents*
• Amantadine and rimantadine
-Not recommended because of
documented resistance in U.S.
influenza isolates
• Zanamivir and oseltamivir
-neuraminidase inhibitors
-effective against influenza A and B
-oseltamivir approved for prophylaxis
Testing of influenza A isolates from the United States and
Canada has demonstrated that many of these viruses are
resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. The ACIP recom-
mends that neither amantadine nor rimantadine be used
for the treatment or chemoprophylaxis of influenza A in the
United States until susceptibility to these antiviral drugs has
been re-established.
"see Influenza ACIP statement or CDC Influenza website for details
Zanamivir and oseltamivir are members of a new class of
drugs called neuraminidase inhibitors and are active against
both influenza type A and type B. Zanamivir is provided
as a dry powder that is administered by inhalation. It is
approved for treatment of uncomplicated acute influenza
A or B in persons 7 years of age and older who have been
symptomatic for no more than 48 hours. Oseltamivir is
provided as an oral capsule. It is approved for the treatment
of uncomplicated influenza A or B in persons 1 year of age
and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 48
hours. Zanamivir is approved for prophylaxis of influenza
in persons 5 years and older. Oseltamivir is approved for

Influenza
prophylaxis of influenza infection among persons 1 year of
age and older.
In 2007-08, a significant increase in the prevalence of osel-
tamivir resistance was reported among influenza A (H1N1)
viruses worldwide. During the 2007-08 influenza season,
10.9% of H1N1 viruses tested in the U.S. were resistant to
oseltamivir. During 2008 more than 90% of H1N1 viruses
were resistant to oseltamivir. For the 2008-09 influenza
season CDC recommends that persons who test positive for
influenza A should receive only zanamivir if treatment is
indicated. Oseltamivir should be used alone only if recent
local surveillance data indicate that circulating viruses
are likely to be influenza A (H3N2) or influenza B viruses,
which have not been found to be resistant to oseltamivir.
Additional information about influenza antiviral treatment is
available on the CDC influenza website.
11
Antiviral agents for influenza are an adjunct to vaccine and
are not a substitute for vaccine. Vaccination remains the
principal means for preventing influenza-related morbidity
and mortality. Additional information on the use of influ-
enza antiviral drugs can be found in the current ACIP state-
ment on influenza vaccine and on the CDC influenza website
at http://www.cdc.gov/flu.
Nosocomial Infiuenza Control
Many patients in general hospitals, and especially in referral
centers, are likely to be at high risk for complications of
influenza. Hospitalized susceptible patients may acquire
influenza from patients, hospital employees, or visitors.
The preferred method of control is to administer inacti-
vated influenza vaccine to high-risk patients and medical
personnel prior to the outbreak.
During community influenza A activity, the use of antiviral
prophylaxis may be considered for high-risk patients who
were not immunized or were immunized too recently to
have protective antibody levels. Antiviral agents may also
be considered for unimmunized hospital personnel. Other
measures include restricting visitors with respiratory illness,
cohorting patients with influenza for 5 days following onset
of illness, and postponing elective admission of patients with
uncomplicated illness.
Influenza Surveillance
Influenza Surveillance
Influenza surveillance is intended to monitor the prevalence
of circulating strains and detect new strains necessary for
vaccine formulation; estimate influenza-related impact
on morbidity, mortality, and economic loss; rapidly detect
outbreaks; and assist disease control through rapid preven-
tive action (e.g., chemoprophylaxis of unvaccinated high-risk
patients).
• Monitor prevalence of circulating
strains and detect new strains
• Estimate influenza-related
morbidity, mortality and economic
loss
Rapidly detect outbreaks
• Assist disease control through

Measles
Measles
Measles is an acute viral infectious disease. References to
measles can be found from as early as the 7th century. The
disease was described by the Persian physician Rhazes in the
10th century as “more dreaded than smallpox.”
Measles
Highly contagious viral illness
• First described in 7th century
• Near universal infection of
childhood in prevaccination era
• Common and often fatal in
developing countries
In 1846, Peter Panum described the incubation period of
measles and lifelong immunity after recovery from the
disease. Enders and Peebles isolated the virus in human and
monkey kidney tissue culture in 1954. The first live attenu-
ated vaccine was licensed for use in the United States in 1963
(Edmonston B strain).
Before a vaccine was available, infection with measles virus
was nearly universal during childhood, and more than 90%
of persons were immune by age 15 years. Measles is still a
common and often fatal disease in developing countries.
The World Health Organization estimates there were 164,000
deaths globally from measles in 2008.
120
Measles Virus
Measles Virus
The measles virus is a paramyxovirus, genus Morbillivirus. It
is 100-200 nm in diameter, with a core of single-stranded
RNA, and is closely related to the rinderpest and canine
distemper viruses. Two membrane envelope proteins are
important in pathogenesis. They are the F (fusion) protein,
which is responsible for fusion of virus and host cell
membranes, viral penetration, and hemolysis, and the H
(hemagglutinin) protein, which is responsible for adsorption
of virus to cells.
• Paramyxovirus (RNA)
• Hemagglutinin important surface
antigen
• One antigenic type
• Rapidly inactivated by heat and
light
1
1
There is only one antigenic type of measles virus. Although
studies have documented changes in the H glycoprotein,
these changes do not appear to be epidemiologically impor-
tant (i.e., no change in vaccine efficacy has been observed).
Measles virus is rapidly inactivated by heat, light, acidic pH,
ether, and trypsin. It has a short survival time (less than 2
hours) in the air or on objects and surfaces.
Measles Pathogenesis
Pathogenesis
Measles is a systemic infection. The primary site of infection
is the respiratory epithelium of the nasopharynx. Two to
three days after invasion and replication in the respiratory
epithelium and regional lymph nodes, a primary viremia
occurs with subsequent infection of the reticuloendothelial
system. Following further viral replication in regional and
distal reticuloendothelial sites, a second viremia occurs 5–7
days after initial infection. During this viremia, there may be
infection of the respiratory tract and other organs. Measles
virus is shed from the nasopharynx beginning with the
prodrome until 3-4 days after rash onset.
Respiratory transmission of virus
• Replication in nasopharynx and
regional lymph nodes
• Primary viremia 2-3 days after
exposure
• Secondary viremia 5-7 days after
exposure with spread to tissues

Measles
Measles Clinical Features
Clinical Features
The incubation period of measles, from exposure to
prodrome averages 10–12 days. From exposure to rash onset
averages 14 days (range, 7–18 days).
• Incubation period 10-12 days
.
Prodrome
Stepwise increase in fever to
103°F or higher
• Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis
Koplik spots
The prodrome lasts 2–4 days (range 1-7 days). It is charac-
terized by fever, which increases in stepwise fashion, often
peaking as high as 1039–105°F. This is followed by the onset
of cough, coryza (runny nose), or conjunctivitis.
.
Koplik spots, a rash (enanthem) present on mucous
membranes, is considered to be pathognomonic for
measles. It occurs 1-2 days before the rash to 1-2 days after
the rash, and appears as punctate blue-white spots on the
bright red background of the buccal mucosa.
12
Measles Clinical Features
Rash
• 2-4 days after prodrome, 14 days
after exposure
• Persists 5-6 days
Begins on face and head
• Maculopapular, becomes
confluent
• Fades in order of appearance
The measles rash is a maculopapular eruption that usually
lasts 5–6 days. It begins at the hairline, then involves the
face and upper neck. During the next 3 days, the rash gradu-
ally proceeds downward and outward, reaching the hands
and feet. The maculopapular lesions are generally discrete,
but may become confluent, particularly on the upper body.
Initially, lesions blanch with fingertip pressure. By 3-4
days, most do not blanch with pressure. Fine desquamation
occurs over more severely involved areas. The rash fades in
the same order that it appears, from head to extremities.
.
Other symptoms of measles include anorexia, diarrhea,
especially in infants, and generalized lymphadenopathy.
Measles Complications
Complications
Approximately 30% of reported measles cases have one or
more complications. Complications of measles are more
common among children younger than 5 years of age and
adults 20 years of age and older.

cases and occurs almost exclusively in children. Pneumonia
(in 6% of reported cases) may be viral or superimposed
bacterial, and is the most common cause of death.

convulsions, and coma. Cerebrospinal fluid shows pleocy-
tosis and elevated protein. The case-fatality rate is approxi-
mately 15%. Some form of residual neurologic damage
occurs in as many as 25% of cases. Seizures (with or without
fever) are reported in 0.6%-0.7% of cases.

Measles
Death from measles was reported in approximately 0.2%
of the cases in the United States from 1985 through 1992.
As with other complications of measles, the risk of death
is higher among young children and adults. Pneumonia
accounts for about 60% of deaths. The most common causes
of death are pneumonia in children and acute encephalitis
in adults. Since 1995, an average of 1 measles-related death
per year has been reported.
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare degen-
erative central nervous system disease believed to be due to
persistent measles virus infection of the brain. Onset occurs
an average of 7 years after measles (range 1 month—27
years), and occurs in five to ten cases per million reported
measles cases. The onset is insidious, with progressive
deterioration of behavior and intellect, followed by ataxia
(awkwardness), myoclonic seizures, and eventually death.
SSPE has been extremely rare since the early 1980s.
12.
Measles illness during pregnancy results in a higher risk of
premature labor, spontaneous abortion, and low-birthweight
infants. Birth defects (with no definable pattern of malfor-
mation) have been reported rarely, without confirmation
that measles was the cause.
Atypical measles occurs only in persons who received
inactivated (“killed") measles vaccine (KMV) and are subse-
quently exposed to wild-type measles virus. An estimated
600,000 to 900,000 persons received KMV in the United
States from 1963 to 1967. KMV sensitizes the recipient
to measles virus antigens without providing protection.
Subsequent infection with measles virus leads to signs of
hypersensitivity polyserositis. The illness is characterized by
fever, pneumonia, pleural effusions, and edema. The rash is
usually maculopapular or petechial, but may have urticarial,
purpuric, or vesicular components. It appears first on the
wrists or ankles. Atypical measles may be prevented by
revaccinating with live measles vaccine. Moderate to severe
local reactions with or without fever may follow vaccination;
these reactions are less severe than with infection with wild
measles virus.
Modified measles occurs primarily in patients who received
immune globulin (IG) as postexposure prophylaxis and in
young infants who have some residual maternal antibody. It
is usually characterized by a prolonged incubation period,
mild prodrome, and sparse, discrete rash of short duration.
Similar mild illness has been reported among previously
vaccinated persons.
Rarely reported in the United States, hemorrhagic measles is
characterized by high fever (105°–106°F), seizures, delirium,
respiratory distress, and hemorrhage into the skin and
mucous membranes.

Measles
Measles in an immunocompromised person may be severe
with a prolonged course. It is reported almost exclusively
in persons with T-cell deficiencies (certain leukemias,
lymphomas, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS]). It may occur without the typical rash, and a patient
may shed virus for several weeks after the acute illness.
Measles in developing countries has resulted in high attack
rates among children younger than 12 months of age.
Measles is more severe in malnourished children, particu-
larly those with vitamin A deficiency. Complications include
diarrhea, dehydration, stomatitis, inability to feed, and
bacterial infections (skin and elsewhere). The case-fatalit
rate may be as high as 25%. Measles is also a leading cause
of blindness in African children.
12
Measles Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory Diagnosis
Isolation of measles virus is not recommended as a routine
method to diagnose measles. However, virus isolates are
extremely important for molecular epidemiologic surveil-
lance to help determine the geographic origin of the virus
and the viral strains circulating in the United States.
• Isolation of measles virus from a
clinical specimen (e.g., urine,
nasopharynx)
• Significant rise in measles IgG by
any standard serologic assay
(e.g., EIA, HA)
• Positive serologic test for measles
IgM antibody
Measles virus can be isolated from urine, nasopharyngeal
aspirates, heparinized blood, or throat swabs. Specimens
for virus culture should be obtained from every person
with a clinically suspected case of measles and should be
shipped to the state public health laboratory or CDC, at the
direction of the state health department. Clinical specimens
for viral isolation should be collected at the same time as
samples taken for serologic testing. Because the virus is
more likely to be isolated when the specimens are collected
within 3 days of rash onset, collection of specimens for virus
isolation should not be delayed until serologic confirmation
is obtained. Clinical specimens should be obtained within
7 days, and not more than 10 days, after rash onset. A
detailed protocol for collection of specimens for viral isola-
tion is available on the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/
measles/lab-tools/rt-pcr.html.
Serologic testing, most commonly by enzyme-linked
immunoassay (ELISA or EIA), is widely available and may
be diagnostic if done at the appropriate time. Generally, a
previously susceptible person exposed to either vaccine or
wild-type measles virus will first mount an IgM response and
then an IgG response. The IgM response will be transient
(1–2 months), and the IgG response should persist for many
years. Uninfected persons should be IgM negative and will
be either IgG negative or IgG positive, depending upon their
previous infection history.
ELISA for IgM antibody requires only a single serum specimen
and is diagnostic if positive. The preferred reference test is a
176


## p. 177 (#191) ############################################

Measles
capture IgM test developed by CDC. This test should be used
to confirm every case of measles that is reported to have
some other type of laboratory confirmation. IgM capture
tests for measles are often positive on the day of rash onset.
However, in the first 72 hours after rash onset, up to 20%
of tests for IgM may give false negative results. Tests that
are negative in the first 72 hours after rash onset should be
repeated. IgM is detectable for at least 28 days after rash
onset and frequently longer.
A variety of tests for IgG antibodies to measles are available
and include ELISA, hemagglutination inhibition (HI), indirect
fluorescent antibody tests, microneutralization, and plaque
reduction neutralization. Complement fixation, while widely
used in the past, is no longer recommended.
121
IgG testing for acute measles requires demonstration of a
rise in titer of antibody against measles virus, so two serum
specimens are always required. The first specimen should
be drawn as soon after rash onset as possible. The second
specimen should be drawn 10–30 days later. The tests for
IgG antibody should be conducted on both specimens at the
same time. The same type of test should be used on both
specimens. The specific criteria for documenting an increase
in titer depend on the test.
1
Tests for IgG antibody require two serum specimens, and
a confirmed diagnosis cannot be made until the second
specimen is obtained. As a result, IgM tests are generally
preferred to confirm the diagnosis of measles.
Epidemiology

Measles occurs throughout the world. However, inter-
ruption of indigenous transmission of measles has been
achieved in the United States and other parts of the Western
Hemisphere.

documented.
Transmission
Measles transmission is primarily person to person via large
respiratory droplets. Airborne transmission via aerosolized
droplet nuclei has been documented in closed areas (e.g.,
office examination room) for up to 2 hours after a person
with measles occupied the area.

Measles
Temporal Pattern
In temperate areas, measles disease occurs primarily in late
winter and spring.
Communicability
Measles is highly communicable, with greater than 90%
secondary attack rates among susceptible persons. Measles
may be transmitted from 4 days before to 4 days after rash
onset. Maximum communicability occurs from onset of
prodrome through the first 3–4 days of rash.

Secular Trends in the United States
Before 1963, approximately 500,000 cases and 500 deaths
were reported annually, with epidemic cycles every 2-3
years. However, the actual number of cases was estimated
at 3-4 million annually. More than 50% of persons had
measles by age 6, and more than 90% had measles by age
15. The highest incidence was among 5–9-year-olds, who
generally accounted for more than 50% of reported cases.

Following licensure of vaccine in 1963, the incidence
of measles decreased by more than 98%, and 2–3-year
epidemic cycles no longer occurred. Because of this success,
a 1978 Measles Elimination Program set a goal to eliminate
indigenous measles by October 1, 1982 (26,871 cases were
reported in 1978). The 1982 elimination goal was not met,
but in 1983, only 1,497 cases were reported (0.6 cases per
100,000 population), the lowest annual total ever reported
up to that time.

From 1985 through 1988, 42% of cases occurred in persons
who were vaccinated on or after their first birthday. During
these years, 68% of cases in school-aged children (5–19
years) occurred among those who had been appropriately
vaccinated. The occurrence of measles among previously
vaccinated children (i.e., vaccine failure) led to the recom-
mendation for a second dose in this age group.

addition to the increased number of cases, a change occurred
in their age distribution. Prior to the resurgence, school-aged
children had accounted for the largest proportion of

Measles
reported cases. During the resurgence, 45% of all reported
cases were in children younger than 5 years of age. In
1990, 48% of patients were in this age group, the first
time that the proportion of cases in children younger than
5
years of age exceeded the proportion of cases in 5–19-
year-olds (35%).
Overall incidence rates were highest for Hispanics and
blacks and lowest for non-Hispanic whites. Among children
younger than 5 years of age, the incidence of measles
among blacks and Hispanics was four to seven times higher
than among non-Hispanic whites.
A total of 123 measles-associated deaths were reported
(death-to-case ratio of 2.2 per 1,000 cases). Forty-nine
percent of deaths were among children younger than 5
years of age. Ninety percent of fatal cases occurred among
persons with no history of vaccination. Sixty-four deaths
were reported in 1990, the largest annual number of deaths
from measles since 1971.
12

The most important cause of the measles resurgence of
1989–1991 was low vaccination coverage. Measles vaccine
coverage was low in many cities, including some that
experienced large outbreaks among preschool-aged children
throughout the early to mid-1980s. Surveys in areas experi-
encing outbreaks among preschool-aged children indicated
that as few as 50% of children had been vaccinated against
measles by their second birthday, and that black and
Hispanic children were less likely to be age-appropriately
vaccinated than were white children.
In addition, measles susceptibility of infants younger than
1 year of age may have increased. During the 1989–1991
measles resurgence, incidence rates for infants were more
than twice as high as those in any other age group. The
mothers of many infants who developed measles were
young, and their measles immunity was most often due
to vaccination rather than infection with wild virus. As a
result, a smaller amount of antibody was transferred across
the placenta to the fetus, compared with antibody transfer
from mothers who had higher antibody titers resulting
from wild-virus infection. The lower quantity of antibody
resulted in immunity that waned more rapidly, making
infants susceptible at a younger age than in the past.
The increase in measles in 1989–1991 was not limited to the
United States. Large outbreaks of measles were reported by
many other countries of North and Central America, including
Canada, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico,
and Nicaragua.

Measles
Measles 1993-2009
Measles Since 1993
Reported cases of measles declined rapidly after the 1989
1991 resurgence. This decline was due primarily to intensive
efforts to vaccinate preschool-aged children. Measles vacci-
nation levels among 2-year-old children increased from 70%
in 1990 to 91% in 1997.
• Endemic transmission interrupted
• Record low annual total in 2004
(37 total cases)
• Many cases among adults
• Most cases imported or linked to
importation
Since 1993, fewer than 500 cases have been reported
annually, and fewer than 200 cases per year have been
reported since 1997. A record low annual total of 37 cases
was reported in 2004. Available epidemiologic and virologic
data indicate that measles transmission in the United
States has been interrupted. The majority of cases are now
imported from other countries or linked to imported cases.
Most imported cases originate in Asia and Europe and occur
both among U.S. citizens traveling abroad and persons
visiting the United States from other countries. An aggressive
measles vaccination program by the Pan American Health
Organization has resulted in record low measles incidence
in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the interruption of
indigenous measles transmission in the Americas. Measles
elimination from the Americas was achieved in 2002 and
has been sustained since then, with only imported and
importation-related measles cases occuring in the region.
12
Since the mid-1990s, no age group has predominated
among reported cases of measles. Relative to earlier
decades, an increased proportion of cases now occur among
adults. In 1973, persons 20 years of age and older accounted
for only about 3% of cases. In 1994, adults accounted for
24% of cases, and in 2001, for 48% of all reported cases.
The size and makeup of measles outbreaks has changed
since the 1980s. Prior to 1989, the majority of outbreaks
occurred among middle, high school and college student
populations. As many as 95% of persons infected during
these outbreaks had received one prior dose of measles
vaccine. A second dose of measles vaccine was recom-
mended for school-aged children in 1989, and all states
now require two doses of measles vaccine for school-aged
children. As a result, measles outbreaks in school settings
are now uncommon.
In 2008 a total of 140 measles cases was reported, the
largest annual total since 1996. Eighty nine percent of these
cases were imported from or associated with importations
from other countries, particularly countries in Europe where
several outbreaks are ongoing. Persons younger than 20
years of age accounted for 76% of the cases; 91% were in
persons who were unvaccinated (most because of personal
or religious beliefs) or of unknown vaccination status. The
increase in the number of cases of measles in 2008 was not
a result of a greater number of imported measles cases. It
180

Measles
was the result of more measles transmission after the virus
was imported. The importation-associated cases occurred
largely among school-aged children who were eligible for
vaccination but whose parents chose not to have them
vaccinated. Many of these children were home-schooled and
not subject to school entry vaccination requirements.

Measles Vaccine
Measles virus was first isolated by John Enders in 1954.
The first measles vaccines were licensed in 1963. In that
year, both an inactivated (“killed") and a live attenuated
vaccine (Edmonston B strain) were licensed for use in the
United States. The inactivated vaccine was withdrawn
in 1967 because it did not protect against measles virus
infection. Furthermore, recipients of inactivated measles
vaccine frequently developed a unique syndrome, atypical
measles, if they were infected with wild-type measles virus
(see Atypical Measles, above). The original Edmonston B
vaccine was withdrawn in 1975 because of a relatively high
frequency of fever and rash in recipients. A live, further
attenuated vaccine (Schwarz strain) was first introduced
in 1965 but also is no longer used in the United States.
Another live, further attenuated strain vaccine (Edmonston-
Enders strain) was licensed in 1968. These further attenu-
ated vaccines caused fewer reactions than the original
Edmonston B vaccine.

Characteristics
The only measles virus vaccine now available in the United
States is a live, more attenuated Edmonston-Enders strain
(formerly called “Moraten"). The vaccine is available
combined with mumps and rubella vaccines as MMR, or
combined with mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine as
MMRV (ProQuad). The Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) recommends that MMR be used when any
of the individual components is indicated. Single-antigen
measles vaccine is not currently available in the United
States.
• Composition Live virus
• Efficacy 95% (range, 90%-98%)
• Duration of
Immunity Lifelong
• Schedule 2 doses
• Should be administered with mumps
and rubella as MMR or with mumps,
rubella and varicella as MMRV
Measles vaccine is prepared in chick embryo fibroblast
tissue culture. MMR and MMRV are supplied as a lyophylized
(freeze-dried) powder and are reconstituted with sterile,
preservative-free water. The vaccines contain a small
amount of human albumin, neomycin, sorbitol, and gelatin.

Measles
MMR Vaccine Failure
• Measles, mumps, or rubella
disease (or lack of immunity) in a
previously vaccinated person
• 2%-5% of recipients do not
respond to the first dose
• Caused by antibody, damaged
vaccine, incorrect records
• Most persons with vaccine failure
will respond to second dose
municable infection. Measles antibodies develop in
approximately 95% of children vaccinated at 12 months
of age and 98% of children vaccinated at 15 months of
age. Seroconversion rates are similar for single-antigen
measles vaccine, MMR, and MMRV. Approximately 2%-5%
of children who receive only one dose of MMR vaccine fail
to respond to it (i.e., primary vaccine failure). MMR vaccine
failure may occur because of passive antibody in the
vaccine recipient, damaged vaccine, incorrect records, or
possibly other reasons. Most persons who fail to respond
to the first dose will respond to a second dose. Studies
indicate that more than 99% of persons who receive two
doses of measles vaccine (with the first dose administered
no earlier than the first birthday) develop serologic
evidence of measles immunity.
12
Although the titer of vaccine-induced antibodies is lower
than that following natural disease, both serologic and
epidemiologic evidence indicate that vaccine-induced
immunity appears to be long-term and probably lifelong
in most persons. Most vaccinated persons who appear
to lose antibody show an anamnestic immune response
upon revaccination, indicating that they are probably still
immune. Although revaccination can increase antibody
titer in some persons, available data indicate that the
increased titer may not be sustained. Some studies
indicate that secondary vaccine failure (waning immunity)
may occur after successful vaccination, but this appears
to occur rarely and to play only a minor role in measles
transmission and outbreaks.
Measles (MMR) Vaccine Indications
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Two doses of measles vaccine, as combination MMR,
separated by at least 4 weeks, are routinely recommended
for all children. All persons born during or after 1957 should
have documentation of at least one dose of MMR or other
evidence of measles immunity (see below). Certain adoles-
cents and adults should receive two doses of MMR.
• All children 12 months of age and
older
• Susceptible adolescents and
adults without documented
evidence of immunity
The first dose of MMR should be given on or after the first
birthday. Any dose of measles-containing vaccine given
before 12 months of age should not be counted as part
of the series. Children vaccinated with measles-containing
vaccine before 12 months of age should be revaccinated
with two doses of MMR vaccine, the first of which should be
administered when the child is at least 12 months of age.
Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine
• 12 months is the recommended
and minimum age
• MMR given before 12 months
should not be counted as a valid
dose
• Revaccinate at 12 months of age
or older
A second dose of MMR is recommended to produce
immunity in those who failed to respond to the first dose.
The second dose of MMR vaccine should routinely be given
at age 4-6 years, before a child enters kindergarten or first
grade. The recommended visit at age 11 or 12 years can
serve as a catch-up opportunity to verify vaccination status

and administer MMR vaccine to those children who have not
yet received two doses of MMR.
Second Dose of Measles Vaccine
The second dose of MMR may be administered as soon as
1 month (i.e., minimum of 28 days) after the first dose.
Children who have already received two doses of MMR
vaccine at least 4 weeks apart, with the first dose admin-
istered no earlier than the first birthday, do not need an
additional dose when they enter school. Children without
documentation of adequate vaccination against measles,
mumps, and rubella or other acceptable evidence of
immunity to these diseases when they enter school should
be admitted after receipt of the first dose of MMR. A second
dose should be administered as soon as possible, but no less
than 4 weeks after the first dose.
• Intended to produce measles
immunity in persons who failed to
respond to the first dose (primary
vaccine failure)
• May boost antibody titers in some
persons
Second Dose of Measles Vaccine
• First dose of MMR at 12-15
months
• Second dose of MMR at 4-6 years
• Second dose may be given any
time at least 4 weeks after the first
dose
121
1
Only doses of vaccine with written documentation of the
date of receipt should be accepted as valid. Self-reported
doses or a parental report of vaccination is not considered
adequate documentation. A healthcare provider should not
provide an immunization record for a patient unless that
healthcare provider has administered the vaccine or has
seen a record that documents vaccination. Persons who lack
adequate documentation of vaccination or other acceptable
evidence of immunity should be vaccinated. Vaccination
status and receipt of all vaccinations should be documented
in the patient's permanent medical record and in a vaccina-
tion record held by the individual.
1
MMRV is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
children 12 months through 12 years of age (that is, until
the 13th birthday). MMRV should not be administered to
persons 13 years of age or older.
For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella
vaccines at age 12 through 47 months, either MMR vaccine
and varicella vaccine or MMRV vaccine may be used.
Providers who are considering administering MMRV vaccine
should discuss the benefits and risks of both vaccination
options with the parents or caregivers. Unless the parent
or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV vaccine, CDC
recommends that MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine should
be administered for the first dose in this age group. For
the second dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella
vaccines at any age (15 months through 12 years) and for
the first dose at 48 months of age or older, use of MMRV
vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of
its equivalent component vaccines (i.e., MMR vaccine and
varicella vaccine).
Adults at Increased Risk of Measles

• International travelers
• Healthcare personnel
Vaccination of Adults
Adults born in 1957 or later who do not have a medical
contraindication should receive at least one dose of MMR
vaccine unless they have documentation of vaccina-

tion with at least one dose of measles-, mumps- and
rubella-containing vaccine or other acceptable evidence
of immunity to these three diseases. With the exception of
women who might become pregnant (see Rubella chapter)
and persons who work in medical facilities, birth before
1957 generally can be considered acceptable evidence of
immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella.
Certain groups of adults may be at increased risk for
exposure to measles and should receive special consideration
for vaccination. These include persons attending colleges
and other post-high school educational institutions, persons
working in medical facilities, and international travelers.
12
Colleges and other post-high school educational institutions
are potential high-risk areas for measles, mumps, and
rubella transmission because of large concentrations of
susceptible persons. Prematriculation vaccination require-
ments for measles immunity have been shown to significantly
decrease the risk of measles outbreaks on college campuses
where they are implemented and enforced. Colleges, universi-
ties, technical and vocational schools, and other institutions
for post-high school education should require documentation
of two doses of MMR vaccine or other acceptable evidence of
measles, mumps, and rubella immunity before entry.
Measles Immunity in
Healthcare Personnel
• All persons who work within
medical facilities should have
evidence of immunity to measles
Students who have no documentation of live measles,
mumps, or rubella vaccination or other acceptable evidence
of measles, mumps, and rubella immunity at the time of
enrollment should be admitted to classes only after receiving
the first dose of MMR. A second dose of MMR should be
administered no less than 4 weeks (i.e., minimum of 28 days)
later. Students with evidence of prior receipt of only one dose
of MMR or other measles-containing vaccine on or after their
first birthday should receive a second dose of MMR, provided
at least 4 weeks have elapsed since their previous dose.
Persons who work in medical facilities are at higher risk for
exposure to measles than the general population. All persons
who work within medical facilities should have evidence
of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella. Because any
healthcare personnel (i.e., medical or nonmedical, paid or
volunteer, full time or part time, student or nonstudent, with
or without patient-care responsibilities) who is susceptible to
measles or rubella can contract and transmit these diseases,
all medical facilities (i.e., inpatient and outpatient, private and
public) should ensure measles and rubella immunity among
those who work within their facilities. (A possible exception
might be a facility that treats only elderly patients considered
at low risk for measles and rubella and their complications).
Adequate vaccination for measles, mumps, and rubella for
healthcare personnel born during or after 1957 consists of
two doses of a live measles- and mumps-containing vaccine
and at least one dose of a live rubella-containing vaccine.

## p. 185 (#199) ############################################

Measles
Healthcare personnel needing a second dose of measles-
containing vaccine should be revaccinated at least 4 weeks
after their first dose.
For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack labo-
ratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity
or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities
should consider vaccinating personnel with two doses of
MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for measles and
mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), respec-
tively. For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who
lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella
immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare
facilities should recommend two doses of MMR vaccine
during an outbreak of measles or mumps and one dose
during an outbreak of rubella.
12.
1
Serologic screening need not be done before vaccinating for
measles and rubella unless the medical facility considers it
cost-effective. Serologic testing is appropriate only if tracking
systems are used to ensure that tested persons who are
identified as susceptible are subsequently vaccinated in a
timely manner. Serologic testing for immunity to measles
and rubella is not necessary for persons documented to
be appropriately vaccinated or who have other acceptable
evidence of immunity. If the return and timely vaccination
of those screened cannot be assured, serologic testing before
vaccination should not be done.

Persons who travel outside the United States are at increased
risk of exposure to measles. Measles is endemic or epidemic
in many countries throughout the world. Although proof of
immunization is not required for entry into the United States
or any other country, persons traveling or living abroad
should have evidence of measles immunity. Adequate vacci-
nation of persons who travel outside the United States is two
doses of MMR.
Measles Vaccine
Indications for Revaccination
.
Revaccination
Revaccination is recommended for certain persons. The
following groups should be considered unvaccinated and
should receive at least one dose of measles vaccine: persons
1) vaccinated before the first birthday, 2) vaccinated with
killed measles vaccine (KMV), 3) vaccinated with KMV
followed by live vaccine less than 4 months after the last
dose of KMV, 4) vaccinated before 1968 with an unknown
type of vaccine (the vaccine may have been KMV), or 5)
vaccinated with IG in addition to a further attenuated strain
or vaccine of unknown type. (Revaccination is not necessary
if I was given with Edmonston B vaccine).

Measles
Postexposure Prophylaxis
Live measles vaccine provides permanent protection and
may prevent disease if given within 72 hours of exposure.
Immune globulin (1G) may prevent or modify disease and
provide temporary protection if given within 6 days of
exposure. The dose is 0.25 ml/kg body weight, with a
maximum of 15 mL intramuscularly. The recommended dose
of IG for immunocompromised persons is 0.5mL/kg of body
weight (maximum 15 ml) intramuscularly. IG may be especially
indicated for susceptible household contacts of measles
patients, particularly contacts younger than 1 year of age (for
whom the risk of complications is highest). If the child is 12
months of age or older, live measles vaccine should be given
about 5 months later when the passive measles antibodies have
waned. I should not be used to control measles outbreaks.
12
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Persons who have experienced a severe allergic reaction
(anaphylaxis) to a vaccine component or following a prior
dose of measles vaccine should generally not be vacci-
nated with MMR.
MMR Vaccine
Contraindications and Precautions
.
• Severe allergic reaction to vaccine
component or following prior dose
Pregnancy
• Immunosuppression
• Moderate or severe acute illness
• Recent blood product
• Personal or family (i.e., sibling or
parent) history of seizures of any
etiology (MMRV only)
Measles and Mumps
Vaccines and Egg Allergy
In the past, persons with a history of anaphylactic
reactions following egg ingestion were considered to
be at increased risk for serious reactions after receipt
of measles- or mumps-containing vaccines, which are
produced in chick embryo fibroblasts. However, data
suggest that anaphylactic reactions to measles- and
mumps-containing vaccines are not associated with
hypersensitivity to egg antigens but to other components
of the vaccines (such as gelatin). The risk for serious
allergic reactions following receipt of these vaccines by
egg-allergic persons is extremely low, and skin-testing with
vaccine is not predictive of allergic reaction to vaccina-
tion. Therefore, MMR may be administered to egg-allergic
children without prior routine skin testing or the use of
special protocols.
• Measles and mumps viruses
grown in chick embryo fibroblast
culture
• Studies have demonstrated safety
of MMR in egg-allergic children
• Vaccinate without testing
MMR vaccine does not contain penicillin. A history of
penicillin allergy is not a contraindication to vaccination
with MMR or any other U.S. vaccine.
Women known to be pregnant should not receive measles
vaccine. Pregnancy should be avoided for 4 weeks
following MMR vaccine. Close contact with a pregnant
woman is NOT a contraindication to MMR vaccination of
the contact. Breastfeeding is NOT a contraindication to
vaccination of either the woman or the breastfeeding child.
Replication of vaccine viruses can be prolonged in persons
who are immunosuppressed or immunodeficient. Severe

Measles
immunosuppression can be due to a variety of conditions,
including congenital immunodeficiency, HIV infection,
leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or therapy
with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large
doses of corticosteroids. Evidence based on case reports
has linked measles vaccine virus infection to subsequent
death in at least six severely immunocompromised
persons. For this reason, patients who are severely immu-
nocompromised for any reason should not be given MMR
vaccine. Healthy susceptible close contacts of severely
immunocompromised persons should be vaccinated.
121
In general, persons receiving large daily doses of corticos-
teroids (2 mg/kg or more per day, or 20 mg or more per
day of prednisone) for 14 days or more should not receive
MMR vaccine because of concern about vaccine safety.
MMR and its component vaccines should be avoided for at
least 1 month after cessation of high-dose therapy. Persons
receiving low-dose or short-course (less than 14 days)
therapy, alternate-day treatment, maintenance physiologic
doses, or topical, aerosol, intra-articular, bursal, or tendon
injections may be vaccinated. Although persons receiving
high doses of systemic corticosteroids daily or on alternate
days during an interval of less than 14 days generally can
receive MMR or its component vaccines immediately after
cessation of treatment, some experts prefer waiting until 2
weeks after completion of therapy.

Patients with leukemia in remission who have not received
chemotherapy for at least 3 months may receive MMR or
its component vaccines.
Measles Vaccine and HIV Infection
Measles disease may be severe in persons with HIV infec-
tion. Available data indicate that vaccination with MMR
has not been associated with severe or unusual adverse
reactions in HIV-infected persons without evidence of
severe immunosuppression, although antibody responses
have been variable. MMR vaccine is recommended for
all asymptomatic HIV-infected persons and should be
considered for symptomatic persons who are not severely
immunosuppressed. Asymptomatic children do not need
to be evaluated and tested for HIV infection before MMR
or other measles-containing vaccines are administered.
A theoretical risk of an increase (probably transient) in
HIV viral load following MMR vaccination exists because
such an effect has been observed with other vaccines. The
clinical significance of such an increase is not known.
• MMR recommended for persons
with asymptomatic and mildly
symptomatic HIV infection
• NOT recommended for those with
evidence of severe immuno-
suppression
Prevaccination HIV testing not
recommended
MMR and other measles-containing vaccines are not
recommended for HIV-infected persons with evidence
of severe immunosuppression (see table). MMRV is not
approved for and should not be administered to a person
known to be infected with HIV.

Measles
Persons with moderate or severe acute illness should not be
vaccinated until the illness has improved. This precaution
is intended to prevent complicating the management of an
ill patient with a potential vaccine adverse reaction, such as
fever. Minor illness (e.g., otitis media, mild upper respiratory
infections), concurrent antibiotic therapy, and exposure to
or recovery from other illness are not contraindications to
measles vaccination.

Receipt of antibody-containing blood products (e.g.,
immune globulin, whole blood or packed red blood cells,
intravenous immune globulin) may interfere with sero-
conversion after measles vaccine. The length of time that
such passively acquired antibody persists depends on the
concentration and quantity of blood product received. For
instance, it is recommended that vaccination be delayed for
3 months following receipt of immune globulin for prophy-
laxis of hepatitis A; a 7 to 11 month delay is recommended
following administration of intravenous immune globulin,
depending on the dose. For more information, see Chapter
2, General Recommendations on Immunization, and the
table in Appendix A.
Persons who have a history of thrombocytopenic purpura or
thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) may be at increased
risk for developing clinically significant thrombocytopenia
after MMR vaccination. No deaths have been reported as a
direct consequence of vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia.
The decision to vaccinate with MMR depends on the benefits
of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella and the risks
for recurrence or exacerbation of thrombocytopenia after
vaccination or during natural infection with measles or
rubella. The benefits of immunization are usually greater
than the potential risks, and administration of MMR vaccine
is justified because of the even greater risk for thrombocy-
topenia after measles or rubella disease. However, deferring
a subsequent dose of MMR vaccine may be prudent if the
previous episode of thrombocytopenia occurred within
6 weeks after the previous dose of the vaccine. Serologic
evidence of measles immunity in such persons may be
sought in lieu of MMR vaccination.

## p. 189 (#203) ############################################

Measles
A personal or family (i.e., sibling or parent) history of
seizures of any etiology is a precaution for MMRV vaccina-
tion. Studies suggest that children who have a personal or
family history of febrile seizures or family history of epilepsy
are at increased risk for febrile seizures compared with
children without such histories. Children with a personal or
family history of seizures of any etiology generally should be
vaccinated with MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine because
the risks for using MMRV vaccine in this group of children
generally outweigh the benefits.
Tuberculin Skin Testing
(TST)* and Measles Vaccine
• Apply TST at same visit as MMR
• Delay TST at least 4 weeks if MMR
given first
• Apply TST first and administer
MMR when skin test read (least
favored option because receipt of
MMR is delayed)
12
"previously called PPD
Tuberculin skin testing (TST) is not a prerequisite for vaccina-
tion with MMR or other measles-containing vaccine. TST has
no effect on the response to MMR vaccination. However,
measles vaccine (and possibly mumps, rubella, and varicella
vaccines) may transiently suppress the response to TST
in a person infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. If
tuberculin skin testing is needed at the same time as admin-
istration of measles-containing vaccine, TST and vaccine
can be administered at the same visit. Simultaneously
administering TST and measles-containing vaccine does not
interfere with reading the TST result at 48–72 hours and
ensures that the person has received measles vaccine. If the
measles-containing vaccine has been administered recently,
TST screening should be delayed at least 4 weeks after
vaccination. A delay in administering TST will remove the
concern of any theoretical suppression of TST reactivity from
the vaccine. TST screening can be performed and read before
administering the measles-containing vaccine. This option is
the least favored because it will delay receipt of the vaccine.

MMR Adverse Reactions
Adverse Reactions Following
Vaccination
Adverse reactions following measles vaccine (except allergic
reactions) represent replication of measles vaccine virus with
subsequent mild illness. These events occur 5 to 12 days
postvaccination and only in persons who are susceptible to
infection. There is no evidence of increased risk of adverse
reactions following MMR vaccination in persons who are
already immune to the diseases.
• Fever
• Rash
• Joint symptoms
Thrombocytopenia
• Parotitis
• Deafness
Encephalopathy
5%-15%
5%
25%
<1/30,000 doses
rare
rare
<1/1,000,000 doses
Fever is the most common adverse reaction following MMR
vaccination. Although measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines
may cause fever after vaccination, the measles component
of MMR vaccine is most often associated with this adverse
reaction. After MMR vaccination, 5% to 15% of susceptible
persons develop a temperature of 103°F (39.4°c) or higher,
usually occurring 7 to 12 days after vaccination and
generally lasting 1 or 2 days. Most persons with fever are
otherwise asymptomatic.
In MMRV vaccine prelicensure studies conducted among
children 12–23 months of age, fever (reported as abnormal
or elevated 102°F or higher oral equivalent) was observed
189


## p. 190 (#204) ############################################

Measles
5-12 days after vaccination in 21.5% of MMRV vaccine recipi-
ents compared with 14.9% of MMR vaccine and varicella
vaccine recipients. Two postlicensure studies indicated that
among children 12–23 months of age, one additional febrile
seizure occurred 5-12 days after vaccination per 2,300–2,600
children who had received the first dose of MMRV vaccine
compared with children who had received the first dose of
MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine administered as separate
injections at the same visit. Data from postlicensure studies
do not suggest that children 4-6 years of age who received
the second dose of MMRV vaccine had an increased risk for
febrile seizures after vaccination compared with children the
same age who received MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine
administered as separate injections at the same visit.
12
Measles- and rubella-containing vaccines, including MMR,
may cause a transient rash. Rashes, usually appearing 7
to 10 days after MMR or measles vaccination, have been
reported in approximately 5% of vaccinees.
Rarely, MMR vaccine may cause thrombocytopenia within
2 months after vaccination. Estimates of the frequency of
clinically apparent thrombocytopenia from Europe are one
case per 30,000—40,000 vaccinated susceptible persons, with
a temporal clustering of cases occurring 2 to 3 weeks after
vaccination. The clinical course of these cases was usually
transient and benign, although hemorrhage occurred rarely.
The risk for thrombocytopenia during rubella or measles
infection is much greater than the risk after vaccination.
sed on case reports, the risk for MMR-associated throm-
bocytopenia may be higher for persons who have previously
had immune thrombocytopenic purpura, particularly for
those who had thrombocytopenic purpura after an earlier
dose of MMR vaccine.
1
Transient lymphadenopathy sometimes occurs following
receipt of MMR or other rubella-containing vaccine, and
parotitis has been reported rarely following receipt of MMR
or other mumps-containing vaccine.
Arthralgias and other joint symptoms are reported in up to
25% of susceptible adult women given MMR vaccine. This
adverse reaction is associated with the rubella component
(see Rubella chapter, for more details). Allergic reactions
following the administration of MMR or any of its compo-
nent vaccines are rare. Most of these reactions are minor and
consist of a wheal and flare or urticaria at the injection site.
Immediate, anaphylactic reactions to MMR or its component
vaccines are extremely rare. Allergic reactions including rash,
pruritus, and purpura have been temporally associated with
mumps vaccination, but these are uncommon and usually
mild and of brief duration.

To date there is no convincing evidence that any vaccine
causes autism or autism spectrum disorder. Concern has
been raised about a possible relation between MMR vaccine
and autism by some parents of children with autism.
Symptoms of autism are often noticed by parents during the
second year of life, and may follow administration of MMR
by weeks or months. Two independent nongovernmental
groups, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), have reviewed the evidence
regarding a potential link between autism and MMR vaccine.
Both groups independently concluded that available
evidence does not support an association, and that the
United States should continue its current MMR vaccination
policy. Additional research on the cause of autism is needed.
121
Vaccine Storage and Handling
MMR vaccine can be stored either in the freezer or the
refrigerator and should be protected from light at all times.
MMRV vaccine should be stored frozen between -58°F and
+5°F (-50°C to -15°C). When MMR vaccine is stored in the
freezer, the temperature should be the same as that required
for MMRV, between -58°F and +5°F (-50°C to -15°C). Storing
MMR in the freezer with MMRV may help prevent inadver-
tent storage of MMRV in the refrigerator.
1
Diluent may be stored at refrigerator temperature or at room
temperature.
After reconstitution, dilulent may be stored at refrigeration
temperature or at room temperature. MMR vaccines must
be stored at refrigerator temperature and protected from
light. Reconstituted vaccine should be used immediately. If
reconstituted vaccine is not used within 8 hours, it must be
discarded. MMRV must be administered within 30 minutes of
reconstitution.

Meningococcal Disease
Neisseria meningitidis
Meningococcal Disease
Meningococcal disease is an acute, potentially severe illness
caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. Illness
believed to be meningococcal disease was first reported
in the 16th century. The first definitive description of
the disease was by Vieusseux in Switzerland in 1805. The
bacterium was first identified in the spinal fluid of patients
by Weichselbaum in 1887.
• Severe acute bacterial infection
• Cause of meningitis, sepsis, and
focal infections
• Epidemic disease in sub-Saharan
Africa
• Current polysaccharide vaccine
licensed in 1978
Conjugate vaccine licensed in 2005
.
Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of bacterial menin-
gitis and sepsis in the United States. It can also cause focal
disease, such as pneumonia and arthritis. N. meningitidis is
also a cause of epidemics of meningitis and bacteremia in
sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization has esti-
mated that meningococcal disease was the cause of 171,000
deaths worldwide in 2000.
13
The first monovalent (group C) polysaccharide vaccine
was licensed in the United States in 1974. A quadrivalent
polysaccharide vaccine was licensed in 1978. Meningococcal
conjugate vaccine has been licensed in United Kingdom
since 1999 and has had a major impact on the incidence
of type C meningococcal disease. A quadrivalent conjugate
vaccine was first licensed in the United States in 2005.
Neisseria meningitidis
N. meningitidis, or meningococcus, is an aerobic, gram-
negative diplococcus, closely related to N. gonorrhoeae,
and to several nonpathogenic Neisseria species, such as N.
lactamica. The organism has both an inner (cytoplasmic)
and outer membrane, separated by a cell wall. The outer
membrane contains several protein structures that enable
the bacteria to interact with the host cells as well as perform
other functions.

depends on geographic location and
other factors (e.g. age)
The outer membrane is surrounded by a polysaccharide
capsule that is necessary for pathogenicity because it helps
the bacteria resist phagocytosis and complement-mediated
lysis. The outer membrane proteins and the capsular
polysaccharide make up the main surface antigens of the
organism.
Meningococci are classified by using serologic methods
based on the structure of the polysaccharide capsule.
Thirteen antigenically and chemically distinct polysaccharide
capsules have been described. Some strains, often those
found to cause asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage,
are not groupable and do not have a capsule. Almost all
invasive disease is caused by one of five serogroups: A, B,
C, Y, and W-135. The relative importance of each serogroup
depends on geographic location, as well as other factors,
such as age. For instance, serogroup A is a major cause of

disease in sub-Saharan Africa but is rarely isolated in the
United States.
Meningococci are further classified on the basis of certain
outer membrane proteins. Molecular subtyping using
specialized laboratory techniques (e.g., pulsed-field gel elec-
trophoresis) can provide useful epidemiologic information.
Meningococcal Disease
Pathogenesis
• Organism colonizes nasopharynx
• In some persons organism invades
bloodstream and causes infection
at distant site
• Antecedent URI may be a
contributing factor
Pathogenesis
Meningococci are transmitted by droplet aerosol or secre-
tions from the nasopharynx of colonized persons. The
bacteria attach to and multiply on the mucosal cells of the
nasopharynx. In a small proportion (less than 1%) of colonized
persons, the organism penetrates the mucosal cells and enters
the bloodstream. The bacteria spread by way of the blood
to many organs. In about 50% of bacteremic persons, the
organism crosses the blood-brain barrier into the cerebro-
spinal fluid and causes purulent meningitis. An antecedent
upper respiratory infection may be a contributing factor.
13
Clinical Features
The incubation period of meningococcal disease is 3 to 4
days, with a range of 2 to 10 days.

Meningitis is the most common presentation of invasive
meningococcal disease and results from hematogenous
dissemination of the organism. Meningeal infection is
similar to other forms of acute purulent meningitis, with
sudden onset of fever, headache, and stiff neck, often
accompanied by other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting,
photophobia (eye sensitivity to light), and altered mental
status. Meningococci can be isolated from the blood in up to
75% of persons with meningitis.

Meningococcal sepsis (bloodstream infection or meningococ-
cemia) occurs without meningitis in 5% to 20% of invasive
meningococcal infections. This condition is characterized by
abrupt onset of fever and a petechial or purpuric rash, often
associated with hypotension, shock, acute adrenal hemor-
rhage, and multiorgan failure.
Less common presentations of meningococcal disease
include pneumonia (5% to 15% of cases), arthritis (2%), otitis
media (1%), and epiglottitis (less than 1%).
Meningococcemia
• Bloodstream infection
• May occur with or without
meningitis
• Clinical findings
-fever
-petechial or purpuric rash
- hypotension
-multiorgan failure
The case-fatality rate of invasive meningococcal disease is
9% to 12%, even with appropriate antibiotic therapy. The
fatality rate of meningococcemia is up to 40%. As many as
20% of survivors have permanent sequelae, such as hearing
loss, neurologic damage, or loss of a limb.
Risk factors for the development of meningococcal disease
include deficiencies in the terminal common complement

pathway and functional or anatomic asplenia. Persons
with HIV infection are probably at increased risk for
meningococcal disease. Certain genetic factors (such as
polymorphisms in the genes for mannose-binding lectin and
tumor necrosis factor) may also be risk factors.
Neisseria meningitidis
Risk Factors for Invasive Disease
• Host factors
- terminal complement pathway deficiency
-asplenia
- genetic risk factors
• Exposure factors
-household exposure
- concurrent upper respiratory tract infection
- demographic and socioeconomic factors and
crowding
- active and passive smoking
Family members of an infected person are at increased risk
for meningococcal disease. Antecedent upper respiratory
tract infection, household crowding, and both active and
passive smoking also are also associated with increased
risk. In the United States, African Americans and persons
of low socioeconomic status have been consistently at
higher risk; however, race and low socioeconomic status are
likely markers for differences in factors such as household
crowding rather than risk factors. During outbreaks, bar or
nightclub patronage and alcohol use have also been associ-
ated with higher risk for disease.
Cases of invasive meningococcal disease, including at least
two fatal cases, have been reported among microbiologists.
These persons have worked with N. meningitidis isolates
rather than patient specimens.

Meningococcal Disease
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory Diagnosis
Invasive meningococcal disease is typically diagnosed by
isolation of N. meningitidis from a normally sterile site.
However, sensitivity of bacterial culture may be low, particu-
larly when performed after initiation of antibiotic therapy.
A Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid showing gram-negative
diplococci strongly suggests meningococcal meningitis.
• Bacterial culture
1
0
• Gram stain
Non-culture methods
-antigen detection in CSF
-serology
Kits to detect polysaccharide antigen in cerebrospinal
fluid are rapid and specific, but false-negative results are
common, particularly in serogroup B disease. Antigen tests
of urine or serum are unreliable.
Serologic testing (e.g., enzyme immunoassay) for antibodies
to polysaccharide may be used as part of the evaluation if
meningococcal disease is suspected but should not be used
to establish the diagnosis.
Medical Management
The clinical presentation of meningococcal meningitis is
similar to other forms of bacterial meningitis. Consequently,
empiric therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., third-
generation cephalosporin, vancomycin) should be started
promptly after appropriate cultures have been obtained.
Neisseria meningitidis
Medical Management
• Initial empiric antibiotic treatment
after appropriate cultures are
obtained
• Treatment with penicillin alone
recommended after confirmation
of N. meningitidis
Many antibiotics are effective for N. meningitidis infection,
including penicillin. Few penicillin-resistant strains of
meningococcus have been reported in the United States.
Once N. meningitidis infection has been confirmed, peni-
cillin alone is recommended.

Reservoir
Humans are the only natural reservoir of meningococcus. As
many as 10% of adolescents and adults are asymptomatic
transient carriers of N. meningitidis, most strains of which
are not pathogenic (i.e., strains that are not groupable).
Communicability Generally limited
Transmission
Primary mode is by respiratory droplet spread or by direct
contact.
13
Temporal Pattern
Meningococcal disease occurs throughout the year, However,
the incidence is highest in the late winter and early spring.
Communicability
The communicability of N. meningitidis is generally limited.
In studies of households in which a case of meningococcal
disease has occurred, only 3% 4% of households had
secondary cases. Most households had only one secondary
case. Estimates of the risk of secondary transmission are
generally 2-4 cases per 1,000 household members at risk.
However, this risk is 500–800 times that in the general
population.

Secular Trends in the United States
Prior to 2000, an estimated 1,400 to 2,800 cases of menin-
gococcal disease occurred each year in the United States, a
rate of 0.5 to 1.1 per 100,000 population. The proportion of
meningococcal cases caused by serogroup Y increased from
2% during 1989 through 1991 to 37% during 1997 through
2002. Serogroups B, C, and Y are the major causes of menin-
gococcal disease in the United States, each being responsible
for approximately one third of cases. The proportion of
cases caused by each serogroup varies by age group. Among
infants younger than 1 year of age, more than 50% of cases
are caused by serogroup B, for which no vaccine is licensed
or available in the United States. Of all cases of meningo-
coccal disease among persons 11 years of age or older, 75%
are caused by serogroups C, Y, or W-135.

In the United States, meningococcal outbreaks account
for less than 5% of reported cases (95%-97% of cases are
sporadic). However, since 1991, the frequency of localized
outbreaks has increased. Most of these outbreaks have been
caused by serogroup C. Since 1997, localized outbreaks
caused by serogroups Y and B have also been reported. See
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4605.pdf for additional
information on the evaluation and management of menin-
gococcal outbreaks.
Meningococcal Outbreaks in
the United States
• Outbreaks account for <5% of
reported cases
• Frequency of localized outbreaks
has increased since 1991
• Most recent outbreaks caused by
serogroup C
• Since 1997 outbreaks caused by
serogroup Y and B organisms have
also been reported
Large outbreaks of serogroup A meningococcal disease occur
in the African “meningitis belt,” an area that extends from
Ethiopia to Senegal. Rates of endemic meningococcal disease
in this area are several times higher than in industrialized
countries. In addition, outbreaks occur every 8–12 years with
attack rates of 500–1000 cases per 100,000 population.

Meningococcal Vaccines
Characteristics
Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine (MPSV4)
The first meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine was licensed
in the United States in 1974. The current quadrivalent A, C,
Y, W-135 polysaccharide vaccine (Menomune, sanofi pasteur)
was licensed in 1978. Each dose consists of 50 mcg of each
of the four purified bacterial capsular polysaccharides. The
vaccine contains lactose as a stabilizer.
MPSV4 is administered by subcutaneous injection. The
vaccine is available in single-dose and 10-dose vials. Fifty-
dose vials are no longer available. Diluent for the single-dose
vial is sterile water without preservative. Diluent for the
10-dose vial is sterile water with thimerosal added as a

preservative. After reconstitution the vaccine is a clear color-
less liquid.
No vaccine is available in the United States for serogroup B.
Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4)
Two meningococcal conjugate vaccines are licensed in the
United States.
Quadrivalent Meningococcal
Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4)
• Menactra (sanofi pasteur)
• Menveo (Novartis)
• Both vaccines
-quadrivalent (A, C, Y, W-135) conjugated
to diphtheria toxoid (Menactra) or CRM197
(Menveo)
-administered by intramuscular injection
-approved for persons 2 through 55 years
of age
Menactra (sanofi pasteur) was licensed in 2005. The vaccine
contains N. meningiditis serogroups A, C, Y and W-135
capsular polysaccharide antigens conjugated to diphtheria
toxoid protein. Each 0.5-ml dose of vaccine is formulated
in sodium phosphate buffered isotonic sodium chloride
solution to contain 4 mcg each of meningococcal A, C, Y,
and W-135 polysaccharides conjugated to approximately
48 mcg of diphtheria toxoid protein carrier. Menactra is
approved for use in persons 2 through 55 years of age.
It is administered by intramuscular injection. Menactra
is supplied as a liquid in a single-dose vial and does not
contain a preservative or an adjuvant.
13
Menveo (Novartis) was licensed in the United States in 2010.
Menveo consists of two components: 10 ug of lyophilized
meningococcal serogroup A capsular polysaccharide conju-
gated to CRM 197 (MenA) and 5 ug each of capsular polysac-
charide of serogroup C, Y, and W135 conjugated to CRM 197
in 0.5 mL of phosphate buffered saline, which is used to
reconstitute the lyophilized MenA component before injec-
tion. Menveo is approved for use in persons 2 through 55
years of age. It is administered by intramuscular injection. It
does not contain a preservative or an adjuvant.
Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy
Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
The characteristics of MPSV4 are similar to other polysac-
charide vaccines (e.g., pneumococcal polysaccharide). The
vaccine is generally not effective in children younger than
18 months of age. The response to the vaccine is typical
of a T-cell independent antigen, with an age-dependent
response, and poor immunogenicity in children younger
than 2 years of age. In addition, little boost in antibody titer
occurs with repeated doses; the antibody which is produced
is relatively low-affinity IgM, and “switching” from IgM to IgG
production is poor.
A protective level of antibody is usually achieved within
7-10 days of vaccination. Among infants and children
younger than 5 years of age, the level of antibody against
serogroup A and C polysaccharide decreases substantially
during the first 3 years following a single dose of vaccine. In
198

Meningococcal Disease
healthy adults, antibody levels also decrease, but antibodies
are detectable as long as 10 years after vaccination. Although
vaccine-induced protection likely persists in school-aged
children and adults for at least 3 years, the efficacy of the
group A vaccine in children younger than 5 years of age may
decrease markedly within this period. In one study, efficacy
declined from more than 90% to less than 10% 3 years after
vaccination among children who were younger than 4 years
of age when vaccinated. Efficacy was 67% among children
who were older than 4 years of age at vaccination.
Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine
The approval of Menactra was based on studies that
compared the serologic response to a single dose to the
response of persons of similar age who received a single dose
of meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. In these studies a
similar proportion of recipients achieved at least a fourfold
rise in serum bactericidal antibody titer assay following MCV4
as those who received MPSV4. The proportion of recipients in
each group that achieved a titer of 1:128 (the titer considered
to predict protection) was more than 98% in both groups.
131
The approval of Menveo was based on a comparison of
serum bactericidal antibody responses to immunization with
Menveo to those following immunization with Menactra.
The response to Menveo was found to be non-inferior to the
response to Menactra in all age groups that were studied (2
through 55 years).
1
1
When MCV4 vaccine was licensed in 2005 it was believed
that a single dose would provide protection for at least 10
years. Since that time serologic data have become available
that show a significant decline in antibody 3 to 5 years after
vaccination, although few cases among vaccinated persons
have been reported. ACIP believes the serologic data are suffi-
ciently compelling to recommend revaccination for persons at
highest risk of meningococcal disease.
Data indicate that the immune response to a single dose
of meningococcal conjugate vaccine is not sufficient in
persons with persistent complement component deficiency
(e.g., (5--C9, properidin, factor H, or factor D deficiency) or
asplenia. Persons with these conditions should receive a
2-dose primary series administered 2 months apart.

Vaccination Schedule And Use
Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
Routine vaccination of civilians with MPSV4 is not recom-
mended. Use of MPSV4 should be limited to persons older
than 55 years of age, or when MCV4 is not available.

MCV4 Vaccination
Recommendations
• Administer MCV4 at age 11 or 12 years with
a booster dose at 16 years of age
• Administer 1 dose at age 13 through 15
years if not previously vaccinated
• For persons vaccinated at age 13 through 15
years administer a 1-time booster dose is
recommended, preferably at or after 16
through 18 years of age
• Healthy persons who receive their first
routine dose of meningococcal conjugate
vaccine at or after age 16 years do not need
a booster dose
Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine
ACIP recommends routine vaccination of persons with MCV4
vaccine at 11 or 12 years of age, with a booster dose at 16
years of age. After a booster dose of meningococcal conju-
gate vaccine, antibody titers are higher than after the first
dose and are expected to protect adolescents through the
period of increased risk through 21 years of age. For adoles-
cents who receive the first dose at 13 through 15 years
of age, a one-time booster dose should be administered,
preferably at age 16 through 18 years. Healthy persons
who receive their first routine dose of meningococcal
conjugate vaccine at or after age 16 years do not need a
booster dose. Routine vaccination of healthy persons who
are not at increased risk for exposure to N. meningitidis is
not recommended after age 21 years. A booster dose is not
recommended for healthy persons 22 years of age or older
even if the first dose was administered at 11 through 15
years of age.

Meningococcal Endemic Areas 2004
Meningococcal vaccination is recommended for persons
at increased risk for meningococcal disease, including
microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of N.
meningitidis, military recruits, and persons who travel to and
U.S. citizens who reside in countries in which N. meningitidis
is hyperendemic or epidemic, particularly countries in the
sub-Saharan Africa “meningitis belt” (Ethiopia in the east
to Senegal in the west). Epidemics in the meningitis belt
usually occur during the dry season (i.e., from December
to June). Vaccination is required by the government of
Saudi Arabia for all travelers to Mecca during the annual
Hajj. Information concerning geographic areas for which
vaccination is recommended can be obtained from the CDC
Travelers Health website at http://www.cdc.gov/travel. These
high-risk persons should be revaccinated every 5 years as
long as their increased risk continues.
Persons who received the first dose of MCV or MPSV at
age 2 through 6 years and remain at increased risk for
meningococcal disease should be revaccinated 3 years after
the first dose. Persons who received a dose of MCV or MPSV
at 7 years of age or older and remain at increased risk for
meningococcal disease should be revaccinated 5 years after
their previous dose.
Persons with persistent complement component deficiency,
and persons with functional or anatomic asplenia should
receive a 2-dose primary series administered 2 months apart
and a booster dose every 5 years.
HIV infection is not currently considered to be an indication
for MCV4 vaccination by itself. However, some persons with
HIV infection should receive MCV4 for other indications,
such as adolescents or international travel. Persons with
HIV infection who are vaccinated with MCV4 should receive

should receive a second dose at the earliest opportunity.
The minimum interval between MCV4 doses is 8 weeks.
Although doses separated by 8 weeks can both be counted as
valid it is preferable to use a longer interval between doses,
3 to 5 years if possible.

131
cases
Both MCV4 and MPSV4 are recommended for use in control
of meningococcal outbreaks caused by vaccine-preventable
serogroups (A, C, Y, and W-135). An outbreak is defined
by the occurrence of at least three confirmed or probable
primary cases of serogroup C meningococcal disease during
a period of 3 months or less, with a resulting primary
attack rate of 10 or more cases per 100,000 population.
For calculation of this threshold, population-based rates
are used, and not age-specific attack rates, as have been
calculated for college students. These recommendations
are based on experience with serogroup C meningococcal
outbreaks, but these principles may be applicable to
outbreaks caused by the other vaccine-preventable menin-
gococcal serogroups.

Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
For both MCV4 and MPSV4, a severe allergic (anaphylactic)
reaction to a vaccine component or following a prior dose
of either vaccine is a contraindication to receipt of further
doses. A moderate or severe acute illness is reason to defer
routine vaccination, but a minor illness is not. Breastfeeding
and immunosuppression are not contraindications to vacci-
nation. Studies of vaccination with MPSV4 during pregnancy
have not documented adverse effects among either pregnant
women or newborns. No data are available on the safety of
MCV4 during pregnancy. However, pregnancy is not consid-
ered to be a contraindication to either MPSV4 or MCV4.
Adverse Reactions Following
Vaccination

Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
Adverse reactions to MPSV4 are generally mild. The most
frequent are local reactions, such as pain and redness at the
injection site. These reactions last for 1 or 2 days, and occur
in up to 48% of recipients. Fever (100°-103°F) within 7 days
of vaccination is reported for up to 3% of recipients. Systemic

Vaccine Storage and Handling
Both MPSV4 and MCV4 should be shipped in insulated
containers to prevent exposure to freezing temperature.
Vaccine should be stored at refrigerator temperature
(35°_46° F, [2°-8° C]). The vaccines must not be exposed to
freezing temperature, and any vaccine exposed to freezing
temperature should not be used.

Single-dose vials of MPSV4 must be used within 30 minutes
of reconstitution, and multidose vials must be discarded 10
days after reconstitution.
The MenA (lyophilized) component of Menveo can only
be reconstituted using the liquid C-Y-W135 component of
Menveo. No other vaccine or diluents can be used for this
purpose. The reconstituted vaccine should be used imme-
diately, but may be held at or below 77°F (25°C) for up to 8
hours.
If the liquid C-Y-W135 component of Menveo is administered
without using it to reconstitute the lyophilized A component
revaccination may not be needed. Serogroup A disease
is rare in the U.S. so revaccination is not necessary if the
person does not plan to travel outside the U.S. However,
the person should be revaccinated with either a properly
reconstituted dose of Menveo or with Menactra if interna-
tional travel anticipated, especially travel to Africa. There is
no minimum interval between the incomplete dose given in
error and the repeat dose.
Surveillance and Reporting of
Meningococcal Disease
Invasive meningococcal disease is a reportable condition in
most states. All healthcare personnel should report any case
of invasive meningococcal disease to local and state health
departments.

Meningococcal Disease
Antimicrobial Chemoprophylaxis
In the United States, the primary means for prevention of
sporadic meningococcal disease is antimicrobial chemopro-
phylaxis of close contacts of infected persons. Close contacts
include household members, child care center contacts, and
anyone directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions (e.g.,
through kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, endotracheal
intubation, or endotracheal tube management).
For travelers, antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be
considered for any passenger who had direct contact with
respiratory secretions from an index patient or for anyone
seated directly next to an index patient on a prolonged flight
(i.e., one lasting more than 8 hours). The attack rate for
household contacts exposed to patients who have sporadic
meningococcal disease was estimated to be four cases per
1,000 persons exposed, which is 500-800 times greater than
the rate for the total population. In the United Kingdom, the
attack rate among healthcare personnel exposed to patients
with meningococcal disease was determined to be 25 times
higher than among the general population.

Because the rate of secondary disease for close contacts is
highest immediately after onset of disease in the index patient,
antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis should be administered as
soon as possible, ideally less than 24 hours after identification
of the index patient. Conversely, chemoprophylaxis admin-
istered more than 14 days after onset of illness in the index
patient is probably of limited or no value. Oropharyngeal or
nasopharyngeal cultures are not helpful in determining the
need for chemoprophylaxis and might unnecessarily delay
institution of this preventive measure.

Rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone are 90%-95%
effective in reducing nasopharyngeal carriage of N.
meningitidis and are all acceptable antimicrobial agents
for chemoprophylaxis. Systemic antimicrobial therapy for
meningococcal disease with agents other than ceftriaxone
or other third-generation cephalosporins might not reliably
eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis. If
other agents have been used for treatment, the index patient
should receive chemoprophylactic antibiotics for eradication
of nasopharyngeal carriage before being discharged from the
hospital.

Mumps
Mumps
Mumps is an acute viral illness. Parotitis and orchitis were
described by Hippocrates in the 5th century BCE. In 1934,
Johnson and Goodpasture showed that mumps could be
transmitted from infected patients to rhesus monkeys and
demonstrated that mumps was caused by a filterable agent
present in saliva. This agent was later shown to be a virus.
Mumps was a frequent cause of outbreaks among military
personnel in the prevaccine era, and was one of the most
common causes of aseptic meningitis and sensorineural
deafness in childhood. During World War I, only influenza
and gonorrhea were more common causes of hospitaliza-
tion among soldiers. A multistate mumps outbreak in 2006
resulted in more than 6,000 reported cases.
Mumps
• Acute viral illness
• Parotitis and orchitis described by
Hippocrates in 5th century BCE
• Viral etiology described by
Johnson and Goodpasture in 1934
• Frequent cause of outbreaks

Mumps Virus
Mumps virus is a paramyxovirus in the same group as
parainfluenza and Newcastle disease virus. Parainfluenza and
Newcastle disease viruses produce antibodies that cross-react
with mumps virus. The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome.

.
The virus can be isolated or propagated in cultures of various
human and monkey tissues and in embryonated eggs. It has
been recovered from the saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, urine,
blood, milk, and infected tissues of patients with mumps.
Mumps virus is rapidly inactivated by formalin, ether, chloro-
form, heat, and ultraviolet light.
I
1
.
Pathogenesis
The virus is acquired by respiratory droplets. It replicates in
the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes. After 12 to 25
days a viremia occurs, which lasts from 3 to 5 days. During
the viremia, the virus spreads to multiple tissues, including
the meninges, and glands such as the salivary, pancreas,
testes, and ovaries. Inflammation in infected tissues leads to
characteristic symptoms of parotitis and aseptic meningitis.
Mumps Pathogenesis
Respiratory transmission of virus
• Replication in nasopharynx and
regional lymph nodes
• Viremia 12-25 days after exposure
with spread to tissues
• Multiple tissues infected during
viremia
Clinical Features
The incubation period of mumps is 14 to 18 days (range, 14
to 25 days). The prodromal symptoms are nonspecific, and
include myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-grade
fever.
Mumps Clinical Features
• Incubation period 14-18 days
• Nonspecific prodrome of myalgia,
malaise, headache, low-grade fever
• Parotitis in 30%-40%
• Up to 20% of infections
asymptomatic
Parotitis is the most common manifestation and occurs in
30% to 40% of infected persons. Parotitis may be unilateral or
bilateral, and any combination of single or multiple salivary
glands may be affected. Parotitis tends to occur within the
first 2 days and may first be noted as earache and tenderness
on palpation of the angle of the jaw. Symptoms tend to
decrease after 1 week and usually resolve after 10 days.

Complications
Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in the form of
aseptic meningitis (inflammatory cells in cerebrospinal fluid)
is common, occurring asymptomatically in 50% to 60% of
patients. Symptomatic meningitis (headache, stiff neck) occurs
in up to 15% of patients and resolves without sequelae in 3 to
10 days. Adults are at higher risk for this complication than
are children, and boys are more commonly affected than girls
(3:1 ratio). Parotitis may be absent in as many as 50% of such
patients. Encephalitis is rare (less than 2 per 100,000 mumps
cases).
Pancreatitis

Orchitis (testicular inflammation) is the most common compli-
cation in postpubertal males. It occurs in as many as 50% of
postpubertal males, usually after parotitis, but it may precede
it, begin simultaneously, or occur alone. It is bilateral in
approximately 30% of affected males. There is usually abrupt
onset of testicular swelling, tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and
fever. Pain and swelling may subside in 1 week, but tenderness
may last for weeks. Approximately 50% of patients with orchitis
have some degree of testicular atrophy, but sterility is rare.
Oophoritis (ovarian inflammation) occurs in 5% of post-
pubertal females. It may mimic appendicitis. There is no
relationship to impaired fertility.
Pancreatitis is infrequent, but occasionally occurs without
parotitis; the hyperglycemia is transient and is reversible.
Although single instances of diabetes mellitus have been
reported, a causal relationship with mumps virus infection
has yet to be conclusively demonstrated; many cases of
temporal association have been described both in siblings and
individuals, and outbreaks of diabetes have been reported a
few months or years after outbreaks of mumps.
Deafness caused by mumps virus occurs in approximately
1 per 20,000 reported cases. Hearing loss is unilateral in
approximately 80% of cases and may be associated with
vestibular reactions. Onset is usually sudden and results in
permanent hearing impairment.
Electrocardiogram changes compatible with myocarditis are
seen in 3%-15% of patients with mumps, but symptomatic
involvement is rare. Complete recovery is the rule, but deaths
have been reported.
Other less common complications of mumps include arth-
ralgia, arthritis, and nephritis. An average of one death from
mumps per year was reported during 1980–1999.

Mumps
Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of mumps is usually suspected based on clinical
manifestations, in particular the presence of parotitis.
Mumps virus can be isolated from clinical specimens. The
preferred sample for viral isolation is a swab from the
parotid duct, or the duct of another affected salivary gland.
Collection of viral samples from persons suspected of having
mumps is strongly recommended. Mumps virus can also be
detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Mumps Laboratory Diagnosis
• Isolation of mumps virus
• Detection of mumps antigen by
PCR
Serologic testing
-positive IgM antibody
-significant increase in IgG
antibody between acute and
convalescent specimens
Serology is the simplest method for confirming mumps
virus infection and enzyme immunoassay (EIA), is the most
commonly used test. EIA is widely available and is more
sensitive than other serologic tests. It is available for both
IgM and IgG. IgM antibodies usually become detectable
during the first few days of illness and reach a peak about
a week after onset. However, as with measles and rubella,
mumps IgM may be transient or missing in persons who
have had any doses of mumps-containing vaccine. Sera
should be collected as soon as possible after symptom
onset for IgM testing or as the acute-phase specimen for
IgG seroconversion. Convalescent-phase sera should be
collected 2 weeks later. A negative serologic test, especially
in a vaccinated person, should not be used to rule out a
mumps diagnosis because the tests are not sensitive enough
to detect infection in all persons with clinical illness. In the
absence of another diagnosis, a person meeting the clinical
case definition should be reported as a mumps case.

occurred in the United States in 1964. Following vaccine
licensure, reported mumps decreased rapidly. Approximately
3,000 cases were reported annually in 1983–1985 (1.3–1.55
cases per 100,000 population).

In 1986 and 1987, there was a relative resurgence of
mumps, which peaked in 1987, when 12,848 cases were
reported. The highest incidence of mumps during the resur-
gence was among older school-age and college-age youth
(10–19 years of age), who were born before routine mumps
vaccination was recommended. Mumps incidence in this
period correlated with the absence of comprehensive state
requirements for mumps immunization. Several mumps
outbreaks among highly vaccinated school populations were
reported, indicating that high coverage with a single dose of
mumps vaccine did not always prevent disease transmission,
probably because of vaccine failure.

Since 1989, the number of reported mumps cases has
steadily declined, from 5,712 cases to a total of 258 cases in
2004. In 2006, the United States experienced a multi-state
outbreak involving 6,584 reported cases of mumps. This
resurgence predominantly affected Midwestern college
students with the highest attack rates occurring among
those living in dormitories. In the following two years, the
number of reported cases returned to usual levels, and
outbreaks involved fewer than 20 cases.
Beginning in June 2009, the largest U.S. mumps outbreak
since 2006 has occurred. The index case was an 11 year old
male infected in the United Kingdom, where approximately
7,400 reports of laboratory-confirmed mumps were received
by the Health Protection Agency in 2009. A total of 3,502
outbreak-related cases were reported, primarily from New
York. The outbreak was confined primarily to Orthodox
Jewish communities, with less than 3% of cases occurring
among persons outside these communities. The largest
percentage of cases (53%) occurred among persons aged
5–17 years, and 71% of the patients were male. Among the

patients for whom vaccination status was reported, 90% had
received at least 1 dose of mumps-containing vaccine, and
76% had received 2 doses.
Like the mumps outbreaks that occurred in 2006, much of
the 2009-2010 outbreak occurred in congregate settings,
where prolonged, close contact among persons facilitated
transmission. Although school settings and large household
sizes likely promoted transmission, the high vaccination
coverage in the affected communities likely limited the size
of the outbreak. In addition, high vaccination coverage and
less intense exposures in surrounding communities are the
most plausible reasons that the few cases outside of the
affected communities have not caused other outbreaks.

classification and epidemiologic classification of mumps see

Mumps Vaccine
140
1
Characteristics
Mumps virus was isolated in 1945, and an inactivated vaccine
was developed in 1948. This vaccine produced only short-
lasting immunity, and its use was discontinued in the mid-
1970s. The currently used Jeryl Lynn strain of live attenuated
mumps virus vaccine was licensed in December 1967.
Mumps Vaccine

Efficacy
95% (Range, 90%-97%)

• Duration of
Immunity
Lifelong
• Schedule
At least 1 dose
• Should be administered with measles and
rubella (MMR) or with measles, rubella and
varicella (MMRV)
Mumps vaccine is available combined with measles and
rubella vaccines (as MMR), or combined with measles,
rubella, and varicella vaccine as MMRV (ProQuad). The
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
recommends that MMR be used when any of the individual
components is indicated. Single-antigen mumps vaccine is
not currently available in the United States.
Mumps vaccine is prepared in chick embryo fibroblast
tissue culture. MMR and MMRV are supplied as a lyophilized
(freeze-dried) powder and are reconstituted with sterile,
preservative-free water. The vaccine contains small amounts
of human albumin, neomycin, sorbitol, and gelatin.
Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy
Mumps vaccine produces an inapparent, or mild, noncom-
municable infection. More than 97% of recipients of a single
dose develop measurable antibody. Seroconversion rates are
similar for single antigen mumps vaccine, MMR, and MMRV.
Postlicensure studies conducted in the United States during
1973–1989 determined that one dose of mumps or MMR
vaccine was 75%-91% effective. A study from the United
Kingdom documented vaccine effectiveness of 88% with two

Mumps
doses. The duration of vaccine-induced immunity is believed
to be greater than 25 years, and is probably lifelong in most
vaccine recipients.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
One dose of mumps-containing vaccine is routinely recom-
mended for all preschool-age children 12 months of age and
older and for persons born during or after 1957 not at high
risk of mumps exposure. The first dose of mumps-containing
vaccine should be given on or after the first birthday.
Mumps-containing vaccine given before 12 months of age
should not be counted as part of the series. Children vacci-
nated with mumps-containing vaccine before 12 months of
age should be revaccinated with two doses of MMR vaccine,
the first of which should be administered when the child is
at least 12 months of age.
14
In 2006, ACIP recommended a second dose of mumps
vaccine for school-age children and for adults at high risk of
mumps exposure (i.e., healthcare personnel, international
travelers, and students at post-high school educational
institutions). The combined MMR vaccine is recommended
for both doses to ensure immunity to all three viruses.
The second dose of MMR vaccine should be given routinely
at age 4 through 6 years, before a child enters kindergarten
or first grade. The recommended health visit at age 11 or 12
years can serve as a catch-up opportunity to verify vaccina-
tion status and administer MMR vaccine to those children
who have not yet received two doses of MMR. The second
dose of MMR may be administered as soon as 4 weeks (i.e.,
28 days) after the first dose.
Only doses of vaccine with written documentation of the
date of receipt should be accepted as valid. Self-reported
doses or a parental report of vaccination is not considered
adequate documentation. A clinician should not provide
an immunization record for a patient unless that clini-
cian has administered the vaccine or has seen a record
that documents vaccination. Persons who lack adequate
documentation of vaccination or other acceptable evidence
of immunity should be vaccinated. Vaccination status and
receipt of all vaccinations should be documented in the
patient's permanent medical record and in a vaccination
record held by the individual.
MMRV is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
children 12 months through 12 years of age (that is, until
the 13th birthday). MMRV should not be administered to
persons 13 years of age or older.
For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella
vaccines at age 12 through 47 months, either MMR vaccine
210


## p. 211 (#225) ############################################

Mumps
and varicella vaccine or MMRV vaccine may be used.
Providers who are considering administering MMRV vaccine
should discuss the benefits and risks of both vaccination
options with the parents or caregivers. Unless the parent
or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV vaccine, CDC
recommends that MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine should
be administered for the first dose in this age group. For
the second dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella
vaccines at any age (15 months through 12 years) and for
the first dose at 48 months of age or older, use of MMRV
vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of
its equivalent component vaccines (i.e., MMR vaccine and
varicella vaccine).
Mumps Immunity
· Born before 1957
Mumps Immunity
Generally, persons can be considered immune to mumps
if they were born before 1957, have serologic evidence of
mumps immunity, have documentation of physician-diag-
nosed mumps, or have documentation of vaccination with
at least one dose of live mumps vaccine on or after their
first birthday. Demonstration of mumps IgG antibody by any
commonly used serologic assay is acceptable evidence of
mumps immunity. Persons who have an “equivocal” sero-
logic test result should be considered susceptible to mumps.
• Serologic evidence of mumps
immunity
• Documentation of physician-
diagnosed mumps
• Documentation of adequate
vaccination

For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack
laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella
immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare
facilities should consider vaccinating personnel with two
doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for
measles and mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for
rubella), respectively. For unvaccinated personnel born
before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles,
mumps and/or rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation
of disease, healthcare facilities should recommend two
doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or
mumps and one dose during an outbreak of rubella.

Contraindications and Precautions
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Persons who have experienced a severe allergic reaction
(anaphylaxis) to a vaccine component or following a prior
close of mumps vaccine should generally not be vaccinated
with MMR.
• Severe allergic reaction to vaccine
component or following prior dose
Pregnancy
• Immunosuppression
• Moderate or severe acute illness
• Recent blood product
• Personal or family (i.e., sibling or
parent) history of seizures of any
etiology (MMRV only)

Mumps
In the past, persons with a history of anaphylactic reactions
following egg ingestion were considered to be at increased
risk of serious reactions after receipt of measles- or mumps-
containing vaccines, which are produced in chick embryo
fibroblasts. However, data suggest that most anaphylactic
reactions to measles- and mumps-containing vaccines are
not associated with hypersensitivity to egg antigens but to
other components of the vaccines (such as gelatin). The risk
for serious allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis following
receipt of these vaccines by egg-allergic persons is extremely
low, and skin-testing with vaccine is not predictive of
allergic reaction to vaccination. As a result, MMR may be
administered to egg-allergic children without prior routine
skin-testing or the use of special protocols.
Measles and Mumps Vaccines
and Egg Allergy
• Measles and mumps viruses
grown in chick embryo fibroblast
culture
• Studies have demonstrated
safety of MMR in egg allergic
children
• Vaccinate without testing
MMR vaccine does not contain penicillin. A history of peni-
cillin allergy is not a contraindication to MMR vaccination.
14
Pregnant women should not receive mumps vaccine,
although the risk in this situation is theoretic. There is no
evidence that mumps vaccine virus causes fetal damage.
Pregnancy should be avoided for 4 weeks after vaccination
with MMR vaccine.
Persons with immunodeficiency or immunosuppression
resulting from leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malig-
nancy, immune deficiency disease, or immunosuppressive
therapy should not be vaccinated. However, treatment with
low-dose (less than 2 mg/kg/day), alternate-day, topical, or
aerosolized steroid preparations is not a contraindication
to mumps vaccination. Persons whose immunosuppressive
therapy with steroids has been discontinued for 1 month (3
months for chemotherapy) may be vaccinated. See Measles
chapter for additional details on vaccination of immunosup-
pressed persons, including those with human immunodefi-
ciency virus infection.
Persons with moderate or severe acute illness should not be
vaccinated until the illness has improved. Minor illness (e.g.,
otitis media, mild upper respiratory infections), concurrent
antibiotic therapy, and exposure or recovery from other
illnesses are not contraindications to mumps vaccination.
Receipt of antibody-containing blood products (e.g.,
immune globulin, whole blood or packed red blood cells,
intravenous immune globulin) may interfere with sero-
conversion following mumps vaccination. Vaccine should
be given 2 weeks before, or deferred for at least 3 months
following, administration of an antibody-containing blood
product. See Chapter 2, General Recommendations on
Immunization, for details.
A family history of diabetes is not a contraindication for
vaccination.

Mumps
MMR Adverse Reactions
Adverse Reactions Following
Vaccination
Mumps vaccine is very safe. Most adverse events reported
following MMR vaccine (such as fever, rash, and joint
symptoms) are attributable to the measles or rubella compo-
nents. No adverse reactions were reported in large-scale field
trials. Subsequently, parotitis and fever have been reported
rarely. A few cases of orchitis (all suspect) also have been
reported.
Fever
5%-15%
• Rash
5%
• Joint symptoms 25%
Thrombocytopenia <1/30,000 doses
Parotitis
rare
• Deafness
rare
• Encephalopathy
<1/1,000,000 doses
Rare cases of CNS dysfunction, including cases of deafness,
within 2 months of mumps vaccination have been reported.
The calculated incidence of CNS reactions is approximately
one per 800,000 doses of Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps vaccine
virus. The Institute of Medicine (1993) concluded that
evidence is inadequate to accept or reject a causal relation-
ship between the Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps vaccine and
aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, sensorineural deafness, or
orchitis.
Allergic reactions, including rash, pruritus, and purpura,
have been temporally associated with vaccination, but these
are transient and generally mild.

See the Measles and Varicella chapters for information about
adverse reactions following MMRV vaccine.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
MMR vaccine can be stored either in the freezer or the refrig-
erator and should be protected from light at all times. MMRV
vaccine should be stored frozen between -58°F and +5°F
(-50°C to -15°C). When MMR vaccine stored in the freezer, the
temperature should be the same as that required for MMRV,
between -58°F and +5°F (-50°C to -15°C). Storing MMR in the
freezer with MMRV may help prevent inadvertent storage of
MMRV in the refrigerator.
Diluent may be stored at refrigerator temperature or at room
temperature.
After reconstitution, MMR vaccines must be stored at refrig-
erator temperature and protected from light. Reconstituted
vaccine should be used immediately. If reconstituted vaccine
is not used within 8 hours, it must be discarded. MMRV must
be administered within 30 minutes of reconstitution.

Pertussis
Pertussis
Pertussis, or whooping cough, is an acute infectious disease
caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Outbreaks of
pertussis were first described in the 16th century, and the
organism was first isolated in 1906.
Pertussis
• Highly contagious respiratory infection
caused by Bordetella pertussis
• Outbreaks first described in 16th
century
• Bordetella pertussis isolated in 1906
• Estimated 294,000 deaths worldwide
in 2002
In the 20th century, pertussis was one of the most common
childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood
mortality in the United States. Before the availability of
pertussis vaccine in the 1940s, more than 200,000 cases of
pertussis were reported annually. Since widespread use of
the vaccine began, incidence has decreased more than 80%
compared with the prevaccine era.
Pertussis remains a major health problem among children
in developing countries, with 294,000 deaths resulting from
the disease in 2002 (World Health Organization estimate).
Bordetella pertussis
B. pertussis is a small, aerobic gram-negative rod. It is
fastidious and requires special media for isolation (see
Laboratory Diagnosis).
Bordetella pertussis
15)
1
B. pertussis produces multiple antigenic and biologically
active products, including pertussis toxin, filamentous
hemagglutinin, agglutinogens, adenylate cyclase, pertactin,
and tracheal cytotoxin. These products are responsible for
the clinical features of pertussis disease, and an immune
response to one or more produces immunity following
infection. Immunity following B. pertussis infection does
not appear to be permanent.
Fastidious gram-negative bacteria
Antigenic and biologically active
components:
- pertussis toxin (PT)
- filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA)
- agglutinogens
- adenylate cyclase
- pertactin
- tracheal cytotoxin
Pathogenesis
Pertussis is primarily a toxin-mediated disease. The bacteria
attach to the cilia of the respiratory epithelial cells, produce
toxins that paralyze the cilia, and cause inflammation of
the respiratory tract, which interferes with the clearing of
pulmonary secretions. Pertussis antigens appear to allow
the organism to evade host defenses, in that lymphocytosis
is promoted but chemotaxis is impaired. Until recently it
was thought that B. pertussis did not invade the tissues.
However, recent studies have shown the bacteria to be
present in alveolar macrophages.
Pertussis Pathogenesis
• Primarily a toxin-mediated disease
• Bacteria attach to cilia of respiratory
epithelial cells
• Inflammation occurs which interferes
with clearance of pulmonary secretions
• Pertussis antigens allow evasion of
host defenses (lymphocytosis promoted
but impaired chemotaxis)
Pertussis Clinical Features
Clinical Features
The incubation period of pertussis is commonly 7-10 days,
with a range of 4–21 days, and rarely may be as long as 42
days. The clinical course of the illness is divided into three
stages.
• Incubation period 7-10 days
(range 4-21 days)
• Insidious onset, similar to minor
upper respiratory infection with
nonspecific cough
• Fever usually minimal throughout
course of illness
215


## p. 216 (#230) ############################################

Pertussis
Pertussis Clinical Features
• Catarrhal stage 1-2 weeks
The first stage, the catarrhal stage, is characterized by the
insidious onset of coryza (runny nose), sneezing, low-grade
fever, and a mild, occasional cough, similar to the common
cold. The cough gradually becomes more severe, and after
1-2 weeks, the second, or paroxysmal stage, begins. Fever is
generally minimal throughout the course of the illness.
Paroxysmal
cough stage
1-6 weeks
• Convalescence Weeks to
months
It is during the paroxysmal stage that the diagnosis of
pertussis is usually suspected. Characteristically, the patient
has bursts, or paroxysms, of numerous, rapid coughs,
apparently due to difficulty expelling thick mucus from the
tracheobronchial tree. At the end of the paroxysm, a long
inspiratory effort is usually accompanied by a characteristic
high-pitched whoop. During such an attack, the patient may
become cyanotic (turn blue). Children and young infants,
especially, appear very ill and distressed. Vomiting and
exhaustion commonly follow the episode. The person does
not appear to be ill between attacks.
Pertussis Among Adolescents
and Adults
• Disease often milder than in infants
and children
• Infection may be asymptomatic, or
may present as classic pertussis
• Persons with mild disease may
transmit the infection
• Older persons often source of
infection for children
75
Paroxysmal attacks occur more frequently at night, with
an average of 15 attacks per 24 hours. During the first 1
or 2 weeks of this stage, the attacks increase in frequency,
remain at the same level for 2 to 3 weeks, and then gradu-
ally decrease. The paroxysmal stage usually lasts 1 to 6
weeks but may persist for up to 10 weeks. Infants younger
than 6 months of age may not have the strength to have a
whoop, but they do have paroxysms of coughing.
In the convalescent stage, recovery is gradual. The cough
becomes less paroxysmal and disappears in 2 to 3 weeks.
However, paroxysms often recur with subsequent respiratory
infections for many months after the onset of pertussis.
Adolescents and adults and children partially protected
by the vaccine may become infected with B. pertussis but
may have milder disease than infants and young children.
Pertussis infection in these persons may be asymptomatic,
or present as illness ranging from a mild cough illness to
classic pertussis with persistent cough (i.e., lasting more
than 7 days). Inspiratory whoop is not common.
Even though the disease may be milder in older persons,
those who are infected may transmit the disease to other
susceptible persons, including unimmunized or incom-
pletely immunized infants. Older persons are often found
to have the first case in a household with multiple pertussis
cases, and are often the source of infection for children.

cations of pertussis include otitis media, anorexia, and dehy-
dration. Complications resulting from pressure effects of
severe paroxysms include pneumothorax, epistaxis, subdural

151
Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of pertussis is based on a characteristic
clinical history (cough for more than 2 weeks with whoop,
paroxysms, or posttussive vomiting) as well as a variety of
laboratory tests (culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) and serology).
Culture is considered the gold standard laboratory test and
is the most specific of the laboratory tests for pertussis.
However, fastidious growth requirements make B. pertussis
difficult to culture. The yield of culture can be affected
by specimen collection, transportation, and isolation
techniques. Specimens from the posterior nasopharynx,
not the throat, should be obtained using Dacron® or
calcium alginate (not cotton) swabs. Isolation rates are
highest during the first 3 to 4 weeks of illness (catarrhal
and early paroxysmal stages). Cultures are variably positive
(30%-50%) and may take as long as 2 weeks, so results may
be too late for clinical usefulness. Cultures are less likely
to be positive if performed later in the course of illness
(more than 2 weeks after cough onset) or on specimens
from persons who have received antibiotics or have been
vaccinated. Since adolescents and adults have often been
coughing for several weeks before they seek medical atten-
tion, it is often too late for culture to be useful.
Because of the increased sensitivity and faster reporting
of results of PCR, many laboratories are now using this
method exclusively. PCR should be used in addition to, and
not as a replacement for culture. No PCR product has been
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and
there are no standardized protocols, reagents, or reporting
217


## p. 218 (#232) ############################################

Pertussis
formats for pertussis PCR testing. Consequently, PCR assays
vary widely among laboratories. Specificity can be poor,
with high rates of false-positive results in some laboratories.
Like culture, PCR is also affected by specimen collection. An
inappropriately obtained nasopharyngeal swab will likely
be negative by both culture and PCR. PCR is less affected by
prior antibiotic therapy, since the organism does not need to
be viable to be positive by PCR. Continued use of culture is
essential for confirmation of PCR results.
DFA testing of nasopharyngeal specimens may be useful as
a rapid screening test for pertussis. Use of the monoclonal
DFA test has improved the specificity, but DFA still has a low
sensitivity and should not be relied upon as a criterion for
laboratory confirmation.
15
Serologic testing could be useful for adults and adolescents
who present late in the course of their illness, when both
culture and PCR are likely to be negative. However, there
is no FDA-approved diagnostic test. The currently available
serologic tests measure antibodies that could result from
either infection or vaccination, so a positive serologic
response simply means that the person has been exposed
to pertussis by either recent or remote infection or by recent
or remote vaccination. Since vaccination can induce both IgM
and IgA antibodies (in addition to IgG antibodies), use of such
serologic assays cannot differentiate infection from vaccine
response. At this time, serologic test results should not be
relied upon for case confirmation of pertussis infection.
An elevated white blood cell count with a lymphocytosis
is usually present in classical disease of infants. The
absolute lymphocyte count often reaches 20,000 or greater.
However, there may be no lymphocytosis in some infants
and children or in persons with mild or modified cases of
pertussis. More information on the laboratory diagnosis of
pertussis is available at
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/default.pdf
Medical Management
The medical management of pertussis cases is primarily
supportive, although antibiotics are of some value.
Erythromycin is the drug of choice. This therapy eradicates
the organism from secretions, thereby decreasing communi-
cability and, if initiated early, may modify the course of the
illness.
An antibiotic effective against pertussis (such as azithro-
mycin, erythromycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)
should be administered to all close contacts of persons with
pertussis, regardless of age and vaccination status. Revised
treatment and postexposure prophylaxis recommendations
were published in December 2005 (see reference list). All

not yet received the second booster dose (usually the fifth
dose of DTaP) should be vaccinated. The administration of

posure use of Tdap is unknown.

During 2001–2003, the highest average annual pertussis
incidence was among infants younger than 1 year of age
(55.2 cases per 100,000 population), and particularly
among children younger than 6 months of age (98.2
per 100,000 population). In 2002, 24% of all reported
cases were in this age group. However, in recent years,
adolescents (11-18 years of age) and adults (19 years
and older) have accounted for an increasing proportion
of cases. During 2001–2003, the annual incidence of
pertussis among persons aged 10–19 years increased from
5.5 per 100,000 in 2001, to 6.7 in 2002, and 10.9 in 2003.
In 2004 and 2005, approximately 60% of reported cases
were among persons 11 years of age and older. Increased
recognition and diagnosis of pertussis in older age groups
probably contributed to this increase of reported cases
among adolescents and adults.

Pertussis Surveillance
Pertussis cases are reported to CDC via two systems. States
provide information about cases of pertussis, including
demographic information, through the National Electronic
Transmittal System for Surveillance. More detailed informa-
tion is reported to CDC through the Supplementary Pertussis
Surveillance System. Although many pertussis cases are not
reported, the surveillance system is useful for monitoring
epidemiologic trends. For instance, although the highest
incidence of pertussis occurs in infancy, the age group at
greatest risk for severe illness and complications, in recent
years, the surveillance system has reflected an increase in
the incidence of pertussis in all age groups, most notably
among adolescents and adults.

formalin-inactivated B. pertussis cells. It was developed in the
1930s and used widely in clinical practice by the mid-1940s.
Whole-Cell Pertussis Vaccine
• Developed in mid-1930s and
combined as DTP in mid-1940s
• 70%-90% efficacy after 3 doses
Based on controlled efficacy trials conducted in the 1940s
and on subsequent observational efficacy studies, a primary
series of four doses of whole-cell DTP vaccine was 70%-90%
effective in preventing serious pertussis disease. Protection
decreased with time, resulting in little or no protection 5 to 10
years following the last dose. Local reactions such as redness,
swelling, and pain at the injection site occurred following up
to half of doses of whole-cell DTP vaccines. Fever and other
mild systemic events were also common. Concerns about safety
led to the development of more purified (acellular) pertussis
vaccines that are associated with a lower frequency of adverse
reactions. Whole-cell pertussis vaccines are no longer available
in the United States but are still used in many other countries.
• Protection for 5-10 years
• Local adverse reactions common
Acellular Pertussis Vaccine
151
Characteristics
Acellular pertussis vaccines are subunit vaccines that contain
purified, inactivated components of B. pertussis cells.
Several acellular pertussis vaccines have been developed
for different age groups; these contain different pertussis
components in varying concentrations. Acellular pertussis
vaccines are available only as combinations with tetanus
and diphtheria toxoids.
Pertussis-containing Vaccines
• DTP (pediatric)
-approved for children 6 weeks
through 6 years (to age 7 years)
Pediatric Formulation (DTaP)
Three pediatric acellular pertussis vaccines are currently
available for use in the United States. All three vaccines
are combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids as DTap
and are approved for children 6 weeks through 6 years of
age (to age 7 years). Infanrix (GlaxoSmithKline) contains
three antigens, mostly pertussis toxin (PT) and FHA. Tripedia
(sanofi pasteur) contains two components, FHA and PT,
in equal amounts. Daptacel (sanofi pasteur) contains five
components, PT, FHA, pertactin, and fimbriae types 2 and
3. None of the available DTP vaccines contains thimerosal
as a preservative, although Infanrix and Daptacel contain
2-phenoxyethanol as a preservative. Tripedia does not
contain a preservative. All three vaccines are supplied in
single-dose vials or syringes.

DTap
Since 1991, several studies conducted in Europe and Africa
have evaluated the efficacy of DTP vaccines administered
to infants. These studies varied in type and number of
vaccines, design, case definition, and laboratory method
used to confirm the diagnosis of pertussis, so comparison
among studies must be made with caution. Point estimates
of vaccine efficacy ranged from 80% to 85% for vaccines
currently licensed in the United States. Confidence intervals
for vaccine efficacy overlap, suggesting that none of the
vaccines is significantly more effective than the others.
When studied, the acellular pertussis vaccine was signifi-
cantly more effective than whole-cell DTP. Mild local and
systemic adverse reactions and more serious adverse reac-
tions (such as high fever, persistent crying, hypotonic hypo-
responsive episodes, and seizures) occurred less frequently
among infants vaccinated with acellular pertussis vaccines
than among those vaccinated with whole-cell DTP.
Tdap
Adolescent and adult formulation Tdap vaccines were
licensed on the basis of noninferiority of the serologic
response to the various components compared with each
company's pediatric DTap formulation (Infanrix and
Daptacel) among persons who had received pediatric
DTP or DTP in childhood. For both vaccines, the antibody
response to a single dose of Tdap was similar to that
following three doses of DTaP in infants. This type of study
is known as “bridging.” The new vaccines are assumed to
have similar clinical efficacy as DTP vaccine since a similar
level of antibody to the components was achieved.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
DTAP
The primary series of DTP vaccine consists of four
doses, the first three doses given at 4-to 8-week intervals

(minimum of 4 weeks), beginning at 6 weeks to 2 months

The fourth dose of all brands of DTap is licensed, and
recommended by ACIP, to be administered at 15–18 months
of age (17–20 months for Daptacel). However, ACIP recom-
mends that in certain circumstances the fourth dose be
given earlier than 15 months of age. The fourth dose of
DTap may be given if the child is at least 12 months of age,
and at least 6 months have elapsed since the third dose
of pertussis vaccine was given, and, in the opinion of the
immunization provider, the child is unlikely to return for an
additional visit at 15–18 months of age. All three of these
criteria should be met in order to administer the fourth
dose of DTP at 12–14 months of age.
DTaP Fourth Dose
.
Recommended at 15-18 months*
. May be given earlier if:
- child is 12 months of age, and
- 6 months since DTaP3, and
- unlikely to return at 15-18 months
Children who received all four primary doses before the
fourth birthday should receive a fifth (booster) dose of DTP
before entering school. This booster dose is not necessary
(but may be given) if the fourth dose in the primary series
was given on or after the fourth birthday. The booster
dose increases antibody levels and may decrease the risk
of school-age children transmitting the disease to younger
siblings who are not fully vaccinated.
151
*17-20 months for Daptacel
For children who started the vaccination series with whole-
cell DTP, DTP should be substituted for any remaining
doses of the pertussis series.
Interchangeability of Different
Brands of DTaP Vaccine
• Series should be completed with
same brand of vaccine if possible
ACIP recommends that the series be completed with the
same brand of DTP vaccine if possible. However, limited
data suggest that “mix and match” DTP schedules do not
adversely affect safety and immunogenicity. If the vaccine
provider does not know or have available the type of DTP
vaccine previously administered to a child, any available
DTP vaccine should be used to continue or complete the
vaccination series. Unavailability of the vaccine used for
earlier doses is not a reason for missing the opportunity to
administer a dose of acellular pertussis vaccine for which
the child is eligible.
• Limited data suggest that “mix and
match" DTP schedules do not
adversely affect safety and
immunogenicity
• Use different brand of DTaP if
necessary
Interruption of the recommended schedule or delayed
doses does not lead to a reduction in the level of immunity
reached on completion of the primary series. There is no
need to restart a series regardless of the time that has
elapsed between doses.

ACIP recommends a single Tdap dose for persons aged 11
through 18 years who have completed the recommended
childhood diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis/
diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTP/
DTP) vaccination series and for adults aged 19 through 64
years.
Children 7 through 10 years of age who are not fully vacci-
nated against pertussis (defined as having received fewer
than 4 doses of DTap, or having received 4 doses of DTap
but the last dose was prior to age 4 years) and who do not
have a contraindication to pertussis vaccine should receive a
single dose of Tdap to provide protection against pertussis.
If additional doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid-
containing vaccines are needed, then children 7 through 10
years of age should be vaccinated according to the catch-up
schedule, with Tdap preferred as the first dose. Either brand
of Tdap may be used. Tdap is recommended in this age
group because of its reduced antigen content compared
with DTP, resulting in reduced reactogenicity. Currently,
Tdap is recommended only for a single dose across all age
groups. Further guidance will be forthcoming on timing of
revaccination in persons who have received Tdap previously.
15
Adults 65 years of age and older (e.g., grandparents, child
care providers, and healthcare practitioners) who have
or who anticipate having close contact with an infant
younger than 12 months of age and who previously have
not received Tdap should receive a single dose of Tdap to
protect against pertussis and reduce the likelihood of trans-
mission. For other adults 65 years of age and older, a single
dose of Tdap vaccine may be given instead of Td vaccine,
in persons who have not previously received Tdap. Either
brand of Tdap may be used.
Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the
last tetanus- or diphtheria-toxoid containing vaccine. After
receipt of Tdap, persons should continue to receive Td for
routine booster immunization against tetanus and diph-
theria, generally every 10 years.
Tdap Recommendations
• A single dose of Tdap is recommended for
-adolescents 11-18 years of age
(preferably at 11 or 12 years of age)
-adults 19-64 years of age
-children 7-10 years of age who are not
fully vaccinated against pertussis*
-adults 65 years of age and older who
have or anticipate having close contact
with an infant less than 12 months of age
Any woman who might become pregnant is encouraged to
receive a single dose of Tdap if she has not already received
a dose. Women who have not received Tdap (including
women who are breastfeeding) should receive a dose in the
immediate postpartum period, before discharge from the
hospital or birthing center. If Tdap cannot be administered
before discharge, it should be given as soon as feasible. The
dose of Tdap replaces the next routine dose of Td.
**Not fully vaccinated against pertussis is defined having received
fewer than 4 doses of DTP. or having received 4 doses of DTP but
the last dose was prior to age 4 years. See MMWR 2011.60(No.1).13-5.

Pertussis
Use of Tdap Among
Pregnant Women
• Any woman who might become pregnant is
encouraged to receive a single dose of Tdap
• Women who have not received Tdap should
receive a dose in the immediate postpartum
period
• ACIP recommends Td when tetanus and
diphtheria protection is required during
pregnancy
Pregnancy is not a contraindication for Tdap
• Clinician may choose to administer Tdap to a
pregnant woman in certain circumstances (such
as during a community pertussis outbreak)
.
ACIP recommends Td when tetanus and diphtheria protection
is required during pregnancy. However, pregnancy is not a
contraindication for use of Tdap. A clinician may choose to
administer Tdap to a pregnant woman in certain circum-
stances, such as during a community pertussis outbreak.
When Td or Tdap is administered during pregnancy, the
second or third trimester is preferred to avoid coincidental
association of vaccination and spontaneous termination of
a pregnancy, which is more common in the first trimester.
Clinicians can choose to administer Tdap instead of Td to
pregnant adolescents for routine or "catch-up” vaccination
because the incidence of pertussis is high among adolescents.
Others for whom Tdap might be considered during pregnancy
are pregnant healthcare personnel and child care providers
(to prevent transmission to infants younger than 12 months
of age and to other vulnerable persons) and pregnant women
employed in an institution or living in a community with
increased pertussis activity.
MMWR 2008: 57(RR-4): 1-37
Healthcare personnel who work in hospitals or ambulatory
care settings and have direct patient contact should receive
a single dose of Tdap as soon as feasible. Priority should
be given to vaccination of healthcare personnel who have
direct contact with infants 12 months of age and younger. An
interval as short as 2 years (or less) from the last dose of Td
is recommended for the Tdap dose.

Tdap Vaccine and Healthcare
Personnel
• Healthcare personnel who work in
hospitals or ambulatory care settings and
have direct patient contact should receive
a single dose of Tdap as soon as feasible*
• Priority should be given to vaccination of
healthcare personnel who have direct
contact with infants 12 months of age and
younger
• An interval as short as 2 years (or less)
from the last dose of Td is recommended
for the Tdap dose
Tdap vaccine may be given at the same visit, or any time
before or after any other vaccine.
"if they have not previously received Tdap.
MMWR 2006,56(RR-17):1-37.
Immunity following pertussis is not permanent. Persons with
a history of pertussis should receive a single dose of Tdap if
it is otherwise indicated.
Tdap For Persons Without A
History of DTP or DTaP
All adolescents and adults should have documentation of
having received a primary series of at least three doses
of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids during their lifetime.
A person without such documentation should receive a
series of three doses of tetanus- and diphtheria-containing
vaccine. One of these doses, preferably the first, should be
Tdap. The remaining two doses should be adult formula-
tion Td.
• All adolescents and adults should have
documentation of having received a series
of DTP, DTP, DT, or Td
• Persons without documentation should
receive a series of 3 vaccinations
• Preferred schedule:
-single dose of Tdap*
-Td at least 4 weeks after the Tdap dose
-second dose of Td at least 6 months
after the Td dose

Pediarix
In 2002, the FDA approved Pediarix (GlaxoSmithKline),
the first pentavalent (5 component) combination vaccine
licensed in the United States. Pediarix contains DTap
(Infanrix), hepatitis B (Engerix-B), and inactivated polio
vaccines. In prelicensure studies, the proportion of children
who developed a protective level of antibody and the titer

of antibody were at least as high when the vaccine antigens
were given together as Pediarix as when children received
separate vaccines.
Pediarix
• May be used interchangeably with
other pertussis-containing
vaccines if necessary
• Can be given at 2, 4, and 6 months
to infants who received a birth
dose of hepatitis B vaccine (total
of 4 doses)
• May be used in infants whose
mothers are HBsAg positive or
status is not known*
The minimum age for the first dose of Pediarix is 6 weeks,
so it cannot be used for the birth dose of the hepatitis B
series. Pediarix is approved for the first three doses of the
DTap and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) series, which are
usually given at about 2, 4, and 6 months of age; it is not
approved for fourth or fifth (booster) doses of the DTap or
IPV series. However, Pediarix is approved for use through
6 years of age. A child who is behind schedule can receive
Pediarix as long as it is given for doses 1, 2, or 3 of the
series, and the child is younger than 7 years of age. .
*off-label recommendation
A dose of Pediarix inadvertently administered as the fourth
or fifth dose of the DTP or IPV series does not need to be
repeated.
15
Pediarix may be used interchangeably with other pertussis-
containing vaccines if necessary (although ACIP prefers the
use of the same brand of DTap for all doses of the series,
if possible). It can be given at 2, 4, and 6 months to infants
who received a birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine (total of
four doses of hepatitis B vaccine). Although not labeled
for this indication by FDA, Pediarix may be used in infants
whose mothers are HBsAg positive or whose HBsAg status is
not known.
Pentacel Vaccine
• Contains lyophilized Hib (ACTHIB)
vaccine that is reconstituted with a
liquid DTAP-IPV solution
Approved for doses 1 through 4
among children 6 weeks through 4
years of age
• The DTaP-IPV solution should not be
used separately (i.e., only use to
reconstitute thé Hib component)
Pentacel
Pentacel is a combination vaccine that contains lyophilized
Hib (ActHIB) vaccine that is reconstituted with a liquid
DTP-IPV solution. The vaccine was licensed by FDA in
June 2008. Pentacel is licensed by FDA for doses 1 through
4 of the DTP series among children 6 weeks through
4 years of age. The minimum intervals for Pentacel are
determined by the DTP component. The first three doses
must be separated by at least 4 weeks. The fourth dose
must be separated from the third by at least 6 calendar
months, and not administered before 12 months of age.
Pentacel should not be used for the fifth dose of the DTap
series, or for children 5 years or older regardless of the
number of prior doses of the component vaccines.
The DTaP-IPV solution is licensed only for use as the diluent
for the lyophilized Hib component and should not be used
separately.
Other DTAP Issues
In certain circumstances, vaccination with DTP vaccine
should be delayed until a child with a known or suspected

A family history of seizures or other neurologic diseases,
or stable or resolved neurologic conditions (e.g., controlled

not contraindications to pertussis vaccination.
Pertussis Vaccination of Children who
Have Recovered From Pertussis
Reducing the dose of whole-cell DTP or DTap vaccine or
giving the full dose in multiple smaller doses may result in
an altered immune response and inadequate protection.
Furthermore, there is no evidence that the chance of a
significant vaccine reaction is likely to be reduced by this
practice. The use of multiple reduced doses that together
equal a full immunizing dose, or the use of smaller,
divided doses is not endorsed or recommended. Any vacci-
nation using less than the standard dose should not be
counted, and the person should be revaccinated according

Children who have recovered from documented pertussis
do not need additional doses of pediatric pertussis vaccine.
However, Tdap vaccine is recommended when the child
becomes age eligible. Satisfactory documentation includes
recovery of B. pertussis on culture or typical symptoms and
clinical course when these are epidemiologically linked to
a culture-confirmed case, as may occur during outbreaks.
When such confirmation of diagnosis is lacking, vaccination
should be completed because cough illness may be caused
by other Bordetella species, other bacteria, or certain
viruses.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
DTap Contraindications
DTP
Contraindications to further vaccination with DTP are a
severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a vaccine compo-
nent or following prior dose of vaccine, and encephalopathy
not due to another identifiable cause occurring within 7
days after vaccination.
• Severe allergic reaction to vaccine
component or following a prior dose
• Encephalopathy not due to another
identifiable cause occurring within 7
days after vaccination
Moderate or severe acute illness is a precaution to vaccina-
tion. Children with mild illness, such as otitis media or
upper respiratory infection, should be vaccinated. Children
for whom vaccination is deferred because of moderate or
severe acute illness should be vaccinated when their condi-

tion improves.
Certain infrequent adverse reactions following DTP vaccina-
tion are considered to be precautions for subsequent doses
of pediatric pertussis vaccine. These adverse reactions are
a temperature of 105°F (40.5°C) or higher within 48 hours
that is not due to another identifiable cause; collapse or
shock-like state (hypotonic hyporesponsive episode) within
48 hours; persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3 hours or
longer, occurring within 48 hours; and convulsions with or
without fever occurring within 3 days.
DTaP Precautions*
• Moderate or severe acute illness
Temperature 105°F (40.5°C) or higher
within 48 hours with no other identifiable
cause
• Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic
hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours
• Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 3
hours or longer, occurring within 48
hours
• Convulsions with or without fever
occurring within 3 days
'may consider use in outbreaks
There are circumstances (e.g., during a communitywide
outbreak of pertussis) in which the benefit of vaccination
outweighs the risk, even if one of the four precautionary
adverse reactions occurred following a prior dose. In these
circumstances, one or more additional doses of pertussis
vaccine should be considered. DTP should be used in these
circumstances.
15
Tdap
Tdap is contraindicated for persons with a history of a
severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component or following
a prior dose of vaccine. Tdap is also contraindicated for
persons with a history of encephalopathy not due to
another identifiable cause occurring within 7 days after
administration of a pertussis-containing vaccine.
Tdap Contraindications
• Severe allergic reaction to vaccine
component or following a prior dose
Encephalopathy not due to another
identifiable cause occurring within 7
days after vaccination with a
pertussis-containing vaccine
Precautions to Tdap include a history of Guillain-Barré
syndrome within 6 weeks after a previous dose of tetanus
toxoid-containing vaccine and a progressive neurologic
disorder (such as uncontrolled epilepsy or progressive
encephalopathy) until the condition has stabilized. Persons
with a history of a severe local reaction (Arthus reaction)
following a prior dose of a tetanus and/or diphtheria toxoid-
containing vaccine should generally not receive Tdap or Td
vaccination until at least 10 years have elapsed after the last
Td-containing vaccine. Moderate or severe acute illness is a
precaution to vaccination. Persons for whom vaccination is
deferred because of moderate or severe acute illness should
be vaccinated when their condition improves.
Tdap Precautions
.
History of Guillain-Barré syndrome
within 6 weeks after a previous dose of
tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine
Progressive neurologic disorder until
the condition has stabilized
• History of a severe local reaction
(Arthus reaction) following a prior dose
of a tetanus and/or diphtheria toxoid-
containing vaccine
• Moderate or severe acute illness
As noted above, certain conditions following DTP vaccine,
such as temperature of 105°F or higher, collapse or
shock-like state, persistent crying, or convulsions with
or without fever are a precaution to subsequent doses
of DTP. However, occurrence of one of these adverse
reactions following DTP vaccine in childhood is not a
contraindication or precaution to administration of Tdap
to an adolescent or adult. A history of extensive limb
swelling following DTP is not a contra-indication to Tdap
vaccination. A stable neurologic disorder (such as controlled

seizures or cerebral palsy), pregnancy, breastfeeding, and
immunosuppression are not contraindications or precau-
tions to administration of Tdap.
Adverse Reactions Following
Vaccination
DTaP Adverse Reactions
20%-40%
• Local reactions
(pain, redness, swelling)
DTap
As with all injected vaccines, administration of DTP may
cause local reactions, such as pain, redness, or swelling.
Local reactions have been reported in 20% 40% of children
after the first three doses. Local reactions appear to be more
frequent after the fourth and/or fifth doses. Mild systemic
reactions such as drowsiness, fretfulness, and low-grade
fever may also occur. Temperature of 101°F or higher is
reported in 3%-5% of DTP recipients. These reactions
are self-limited and can be managed with symptomatic
treatment with acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Moderate or
severe systemic reactions (such as fever (105°F or higher],
febrile seizures, persistent crying lasting 3 hours or longer,
and hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes) have been reported
after administration of DTP but occur less frequently than
among children who received whole-cell DTP. Rates of
these less common reactions vary by symptom and vaccine
but generally occur in fewer than 1 in 10,000 doses. See
the pertussis chapter in the textbook Vaccines (Plotkin and
Orenstein, eds., 2008) for a comprehensive review of DTap
adverse event data.
• Temp of 101°F
3%-5%
or higher
• More severe adverse reactions
not common
• Local reactions more common following
4th and 5th doses
151
Information on adverse reactions following a full series of
DTP is also limited. Available data suggest a substantial
increase in the frequency and magnitude of local reactions
after the fourth and fifth doses. For example, swelling at
the site of injection occurred in 2% of patients after the
first dose of Tripedia, and in 29% following the fourth dose.
Increases in the frequency of fever after the fourth dose
have also been reported, although the increased frequencies
of other systemic reactions (e.g., fretfulness, drowsiness, or
decreased appetite) have not been observed. Further details
on this issue can be found in a supplemental ACIP statement
published in 2000 (MMWR 2000;49(No RR-13):1-8).
Adverse Reactions Following the 4th
and 5th DTaP Dose
• Local adverse reactions and fever
increased with 4th and 5th doses
of DTap
• Reports of swelling of entire limb
• Extensive swelling after 4th dose
NOT a contraindication to 5th dose
1
Swelling involving the entire thigh or upper arm has
been reported after booster doses of certain acellular
pertussis vaccines. The limb swelling may be accompanied
by erythema, pain and fever. Although the swelling may
interfere with walking, most children have no limitation of
activity. The pathogenesis and frequency of substantial local
reactions and limb swelling are not known, but these condi-
tions appear to be self-limited and resolve without sequelae.
ACIP recommends that a fifth dose of DTaP be administered
before a child enters school. It is not known whether
229


## p. 230 (#244) ############################################

Pertussis
children who experience entire limb swelling after a fourth
dose of DTP are at increased risk for this reaction after
the fifth dose. Because of the importance of this dose in
protecting a child during school years, ACIP recommends
that a history of extensive swelling after the fourth dose
should not be considered a contraindication to receipt of a
fifth dose at school entry. Parents should be informed of the
increase in reactogenicity that has been reported following
the fourth and fifth doses of DTaP.
Tdap Adverse Reactions
• Local reactions
21%-66%
(pain, redness, swelling)
Tdap
The safety of Tdap vaccines was evaluated as part of
prelicensure studies. The most common adverse reaction
following both brands of Tdap vaccine is a local reaction,
such as pain (66%), redness (25%) or swelling (21%) at the site
of injection. Temperature of 100.4°F or higher was reported
by 1.4% of Tdap recipients and 1.1% of Td recipients. Tdap
recipients also reported a variety of nonspecific systemic
events, such as headache, fatigue and gastrointestinal
symptoms. Local reactions, fever, and nonspecific systemic
symptoms occurred at approximately the same rate in
recipients of Tdap and the comparison group that received
Td without acellular pertussis vaccine. No serious adverse
events have been attributed to Tdap.
75
Temp of 100.4°F
1.4%
or higher
• Adverse reactions occur at
approximately the same rate as Td
alone (without acellular pertussis
vaccine)
Vaccine Storage and Handling
DTP, Td and Tdap vaccines should be stored at 350_46°F
(2°–8°C) at all times. The vaccines must never be frozen.
Vaccine exposed to freezing temperature must not be adminis-
tered and should be discarded. DTP, Td and Tdap should not
be used after the expiration date printed on the box or label.

Pneumococcal Disease
Pneumococcal Disease
Streptococcus pneumoniae causes an acute bacterial infec-
tion. The bacterium, also called pneumococcus, was first
isolated by Pasteur in 1881 from the saliva of a patient
with rabies. The association between the pneumococcus
bacterium and lobar pneumonia was first described by
Friedlander and Talamon in 1883, but pneumococcal pneu-
monia was confused with other types of pneumonia until
the discovery of the Gram stain in 1884. From 1915 to 1945,
the chemical structure and antigenicity of the pneumococcal
capsular polysaccharide, its association with virulence, and
the role of bacterial polysaccharides in human disease were
explained. More than 80 serotypes of pneumococci had
been described by 1940.

Pasteur in 1881
• Confused with other causes of
pneumonia until discovery of Gram
stain in 1884
More than 80 serotypes described
by 1940
• First U.S. vaccine in 1977
Efforts to develop effective pneumococcal vaccines began as
early as 1911. However, with the advent of penicillin in the
1940s, interest in the vaccine declined, until it was observed
that many patients still died despite antibiotic treatment. By
the late 1960s, efforts were again being made to develop a
polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. The first pneumococcal
vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1977. The first
conjugate pneumococcal vaccine was licensed in 2000.

Streptococcus pneumoniae
Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria are lancet-shaped, gram-
positive, facultative anaerobic organisms. They are typically
observed in pairs (diplococci) but may also occur singularly
or in short chains. Some pneumococci are encapsulated,
their surfaces composed of complex polysaccharides.
Encapsulated organisms are pathogenic for humans and
experimental animals, whereas organisms without capsular
polysaccharides are not. Capsular polysaccharides are the
primary basis for the pathogenicity of the organism. They
are antigenic and form the basis for classifying pneumococci
by serotypes. Ninety serotypes have been identified, based
on their reaction with type-specific antisera. Type-specific
antibody to capsular polysaccharide is protective. These
antibodies and complement interact to opsonize pneu-
mococci, which facilitates phagocytosis and clearance of
the organism. Antibodies to some pneumococcal capsular
polysaccharides may cross-react with related types as well as
with other bacteria, providing protection against additional
serotypes.
1
Most S. pneumoniae serotypes have been shown to cause
serious disease, but only a few serotypes produce the
majority of pneumococcal infections. The 10 most common
serotypes are estimated to account for about 62% of invasive
disease worldwide. The ranking and serotype prevalence
differ by patient age group and geographic area. In the
United States, the seven most common serotypes isolated
from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children younger

than 6 years of age account for 80% of infections. These
seven serotypes account for only about 50% of isolates from
older children and adults.
Pneumococci are common inhabitants of the respiratory
tract and may be isolated from the nasopharynx of 5% to
70% of healthy adults. Rates of asymptomatic carriage vary
with age, environment, and the presence of upper respira-
tory infections. Only 5%-10% of adults without children are
carriers. In schools and orphanages, 27%-58% of students
and residents may be carriers. On military installations, as
many as 50%-60% of service personnel may be carriers. The
duration of carriage varies and is generally longer in children
than adults. In addition, the relationship of carriage to the
development of natural immunity is poorly understood.

Clinical Features
Clinical Features
The major clinical syndromes of pneumococcal disease are
pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis. The immunologic
mechanism that allows disease to occur in a carrier is not
clearly understood. However, disease most often occurs
when a predisposing condition exists, particularly pulmo-
nary disease.

Pneumococcal Pneumonia
• Estimated 175,000 hospitalizations
per year in the United States
• Up to 36% of adult community-
acquired pneumonia and 50% of
hospital-acquired pneumonia
• Common bacterial complication of
influenza and measles
• Case-fatality rate 5%-7%, higher in
elderly
Pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common clinical
presentation of pneumococcal disease among adults,
although pneumonia alone is not considered to be
"invasive" disease. The incubation period of pneumococcal
pneumonia is short, about 1 to 3 days. Symptoms gener-
ally include an abrupt onset of fever and chills or rigors.
Typically there is a single rigor, and repeated shaking chills
are uncommon. Other common symptoms include pleuritic
chest pain, cough productive of mucopurulent, rusty
sputum, dyspnea (shortness of breath), tachypnea (rapid
breathing), hypoxia (poor oxygenation), tachycardia (rapid
heart rate), malaise, and weakness. Nausea, vomiting, and
headaches occur less frequently.
As many as 175,000 hospitalizations from pneumococcal
pneumonia are estimated to occur annually in the United
States. Pneumococci account for up to 36% of adult
community-acquired pneumonia and 50% of hospital-
acquired pneumonia. Pneumonia is a common bacterial
complication of influenza and measles. The case-fatality rate
is 5%-7% and may be much higher among elderly persons.
Complications of pneumococcal pneumonia include
empyema (i.e., infection of the pleural space), pericarditis
(inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart), and
endobronchial obstruction, with atelectasis and lung abscess
formation.
Pneumococcal Bacteremia
• More than 50,000 cases per year
in the United States
• Rates higher among elderly and
very young infants
• Case-fatality rate -20%; up to
60% among the elderly
More than 50,000 cases of pneumococcal bacteremia occur
each year. Bacteremia occurs in about 25%-30% of patients

with pneumococcal pneumonia. The overall case-fatality
rate for bacteremia is about 20% but may be as high as 60%
among elderly patients. Patients with asplenia who develop
bacteremia may experience a fulminant clinical course.
Pneumococcal Meningitis
Pneumococci cause 13%-19% of all cases of bacterial menin-
gitis in the United States. An estimated 3,000 to 6,000 cases
of pneumococcal meningitis occur each year. One-fourth
of patients with pneumococcal meningitis also have pneu-
monia. The clinical symptoms, CSF profile and neurologic
complications are similar to other forms of purulent bacte-
rial meningitis. Symptoms may include headache, lethargy,
vomiting, irritability, fever, nuchal rigidity, cranial nerve
signs, seizures and coma. The case-fatality rate of pneumo-
coccal meningitis is about 30% but may be as high as 80%
among elderly persons. Neurologic sequelae are common
among survivors. Persons with a cochlear implant appear to
be at increased risk of pneumococcal meningitis.

Conditions That Increase Risk for
Invasive Pneumococcal Disease
Conditions that increase the risk of invasive pneumococcal
disease include decreased immune function from disease
or drugs, functional or anatomic asplenia, chronic heart,
pulmonary including asthma, liver, or renal disease,
smoking cigarettes, and cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF leak.

Pneumococcal Disease in Children
Pneumococcal Disease in Children
Bacteremia without a known site of infection is the most
common invasive clinical presentation of pneumococcal
infection among children 2 years of age and younger,
accounting for approximately 70% of invasive disease in this
age group. Bacteremic pneumonia accounts for 12%-16% of
invasive pneumococcal disease among children 2 years of
age and younger. With the decline of invasive Hib disease,
S. pneumoniae has become the leading cause of bacterial
meningitis among children younger than 5 years of age
in the United States. Before routine use of pneumococcal
conjugate vaccine, children younger than 1 year had the
highest rates of pneumococcal meningitis, approximately 10
cases per 100,000 population.
• Bacteremia without known site of
infection most common clinical
presentation
• S. pneumoniae leading cause of
bacterial meningitis among
children <5 years of age
• Common cause of acute otitis
media
Pneumococci are a common cause of acute otitis media,
and are detected in 28%-55% of middle ear aspirates. By age
12 months, more than 60% of children have had at least one
episode of acute otitis media. Middle ear infections are the
most frequent reasons for pediatric office visits in the United
States, resulting in more than 20 million visits annually.
Complications of pneumococcal otitis media may include
mastoiditis and meningitis.
Burden of Pneumococcal
Disease in Children*
Before routine use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, the
burden of pneumococcal disease among children younger
than 5 years of age was significant. An estimated 17,000

about 700 were meningitis. An estimated 200 children died
every year as a result of invasive pneumococcal disease.
Although not considered invasive disease, an estimated 5
million cases of acute otitis media occured each year among
children younger than 5 years of age.
Children at Increased Risk of
Invasive Pneumococcal Disease
• Functional or anatomic asplenia,
especially sickle cell disease
• HIV infection
• Alaska Native, African American,
American Indian
• Child care attendance
• Cochlear implant
Children with functional or anatomic asplenia, particularly
those with sickle cell disease, and children with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at very high
risk for invasive disease, with rates in some studies more
than 50 times higher than those among children of the
same age without these conditions (i.e., incidence rates
of 5,000–9,000 per 100,000 population). Rates are also
increased among children of certain racial and ethnic
groups, in particular those of Alaska Native, African
American, and certain American Indian groups (Arizona,
New Mexico, and Navajo populations in Colorado and
Utah). The reason for this increased risk by race and
ethnicity is not known with certainty but was also noted
for invasive Haemophilus influenzae infection (also an
encapsulated bacterium). Attendance at a child care center
has also been shown to increase the risk of invasive pneu-
mococcal disease and acute otitis media 2–3-fold among
children younger than 59 months of age. Children with a
cochlear implant are at increased risk for pneumococcal
meningitis.
16
Laboratory Diagnosis
A definitive diagnosis of infection with S. pneumoniae gener-
ally relies on isolation of the organism from blood or other
normally sterile body sites. Tests are also available to detect
capsular polysaccharide antigen in body fluids.
The appearance of lancet-shaped diplococci on Gram stain
is suggestive of pneumococcal infection, but interpretation
of stained sputum specimens may be difficult because
of the presence of normal nasopharyngeal bacteria. The
suggested criteria for obtaining a diagnosis of pneumococcal
pneumonia using Gram stained sputnum includes more
than 25 white blood cells and fewer than 10 epithelial cells
per 100-power field, and a predominance of gram-positive
diplococci.
The quellung reaction (capsular swelling; capsular precipita-
tion reaction) is a test that provides rapid identification of
pneumococci in clinical specimens, including spinal fluid,
sputum, and exudates. The procedure involves mixing
loopfuls of bacteria in suspension, pneumococcal antiserum,
and methylene blue on the surface of a glass slide and
examining under oil immersion. If the reaction is positive,
the organism will be surrounded by a large capsule.

Pneumococcal Disease
Several rapid tests for detection of pneumococcal polysac-
charide antigen in CSF and other body fluids are available.
These tests generally lack sufficient sensitivity or specificity
to assist in the diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease.
Medical Management
Resistance to penicillin and other antibiotics is common. In
some areas of the United States, up to 40% of invasive pneu-
mococcal isolates are resistant to penicillin. Treatment will
usually include a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, and often
vancomycin, until results of antibiotic sensitivity testing are
available.

Occurrence
Pneumococcal disease occurs throughout the world.

|
Transmission
Transmission of S. pneumoniae occurs as the result of direct
person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets and by
autoinoculation in persons carrying the bacteria in their
upper respiratory tract. The pneumococcal serotypes most
often responsible for causing infection are those most
frequently found in carriers. The spread of the organism
within a family or household is influenced by such factors
as crowding, season, and the presence of upper respiratory
infections or pneumococcal disease such as pneumonia or
otitis media. The spread of pneumococcal disease is usually
associated with increased carriage rates. However, high
carriage rates do not appear to increase the risk of disease
transmission in households.
Temporal Pattern
Pneumococcal infections are more common during the
winter and in early spring when respiratory diseases are
more prevalent.
Communicability
The period of communicability for pneumococcal disease is
unknown, but presumably transmission can occur as long as
the organism appears in respiratory secretions.

Pneumococcal Disease
Secular Trends in the United States
Estimates of the incidence of pneumococcal disease have
been made from a variety of population-based studies. More
than 40,000 cases and more than 4,400 deaths from invasive
pneumococcal disease (bacteremia and meningitis) are
estimated to have occurred in the United States in 2007. More
than half of these cases occurred in adults who had an indica-
tion for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. In addition,
there are thousands of cases of nonbacteremic pneumonia,
and millions of cases of otitis media, which are considered
noninvasive infections.

The overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (bacte-

in the United States in 1998–1999 was estimated to be approxi-
mately 24 cases per 100,000 population. However, incidence
rates vary greatly by age group. The highest rates of invasive
pneumococcal disease occur among young children, especially
those younger than 2 years of age. In 1998, the rate of invasive
disease in this age group was estimated to be 188 per 100,000
population; this age group accounted for 20% of all cases of
invasive pneumococcal disease. Incidence was lowest among
persons 5–17 years of age, and increased to 61 per 100,000
population among persons 65 years of age and older. In 2008,
the overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in the
United States was 14.5 cases per 100,000 population.

Data from the Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) system
suggest that the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has
had a major impact on the incidence of invasive disease
among young children. The overall incidence of invasive
disease among children younger than 5 years of age decreased
from approximately 99 cases per 100,000 population during
1998-1999 to 21 cases per 100,000 population in 2008. The
reductions in incidence resulted from a 99% decrease in
disease caused by the seven serotypes in the first pneumo-
coccal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and serotype 6A, a serotype
against which PCV7 provides some cross-protection. The
decreases have been offset partially by increases in invasive
disease caused by serotypes not included in PCV7, in particular
19A.

vaccine (PPSV23) was licensed and replaced the 14-valent
vaccine, which is no longer produced. PPSV23 contains poly-
saccharide antigen from 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria
that cause 88% of bacteremic pneumococcal disease. In
addition, cross-reactivity occurs for several capsular types
that account for an additional 8% of bacteremic disease.
Pneumococcal
Polysaccharide Vaccine
The polysaccharide vaccine currently available in the United
States (Pneumovax 23, Merck) contains 25 mcg of each
antigen per dose and contains 0.25% phenol as a preserva-
tive. The vaccine is available in a single-dose vial or syringe,
and in a 5-dose vial. Pneumococcal vaccine is given by
injection and may be administered either intramuscularly or
subcutaneously.

Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine
The first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was
licensed in the United States in 2000. It includes purified
capsular polysaccharide of seven serotypes of S. pneumoniae
(4, 9V, 14, 19F, 23F, 18C, and 6B) conjugated to a nontoxic
variant of diphtheria toxin known as CRM 97. In 2010 a
13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was
licensed in the United States. It contains the 7 serotypes of
S pneumonia as PCV7 plus serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A
which are also conjugated to CRM 97. A 0.5-ml PCV13 dose
contains approximately 2.2 ug of polysaccharide from each
of 12 serotypes and approximately 4.4 ug of polysaccharide
from serotype 6B; the total concentration of CRM, is
approximately 34 ug. The vaccine contains 0.02% polysorbate
80 (P80), 0.125 mg of aluminum as aluminum phosphate
(AlPO4) adjuvant, 5mL of succinate buffer, and no thimerosal
preservative. Except for the addition of six serotypes, P80,
and succinate buffer, the formulation of PCV13 is the same
as that of PCV7.

ABCs data indicate that in 2008, a total of 61% of invasive
pneumococcal disease cases among children younger than 5

types caused less than 2% of cases.

persist for at least 5 years in healthy adults but decline more
quickly in persons with certain underlying illnesses.
PPSV23 vaccine efficacy studies have resulted in various
estimates of clinical effectiveness. Overall, the vaccine
is 60%-70% effective in preventing invasive disease. The
vaccine may be less effective in preventing pneumococcal
infection in some groups, particularly those with significant
underlying illness. Although the vaccine may not be as
effective in some persons, especially those who do not have
normal resistance to infection, it is still recommended for
such persons because they are at high risk of developing
severe disease. PPSV23 has not been demonstrated to
provide protection against pneumococcal pneumonia. For
this reason, providers should avoid referring to PPSV23 as
“pneumonia vaccine”.
Studies comparing patterns of pneumococcal carriage before
and after PPSV23 vaccination have not shown clinically
significant decreases in carrier rates among vaccinees. In
addition, no change in the distribution of vaccine-type and
non-vaccine-type organisms has been observed as the result
of vaccination.

• Highly immunogenic in infants
and young children, including
those with high-risk medical
conditions
• >90% effective against invasive

• Less effective against pneumonia

Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine
In a large clinical trial, PCV7 was shown to reduce invasive
disease caused by vaccine serotypes by 97%, and reduce
invasive disease caused by all serotypes, including serotypes
not in the vaccine, by 89%. Children who received PCV7 had
7% fewer episodes of acute otitis media and underwent
20% fewer tympanostomy tube placements than did unvac-
cinated children. There is evidence that PCV7 reduces naso-
pharyngeal carriage of pneumococcal serotypes included in
the vaccine.
PCV13 was licensed in the United States based upon studies
that compared the serologic response of children who
received PCV13 to those who received PCV7. These studies
showed that PCV13 induced levels of antibodies that were
comparable to those induced by PCV7 and shown to be
protective against invasive disease.
In another study of PCV13, children 7-11 months, 12-23
months, and 24-71 months of age who had not received
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine doses previously were
administered 1, 2, or 3 doses of PCV13 according to age-
appropriate immunization schedules. These schedules
resulted in antibody responses to each of the 13 serotypes
that were comparable to those achieved after the 3-dose
infant PCV13 series in the U.S. immunogenicity trial, except
for serotype 1, for which IgG GMC was lower among children
aged 24-71 months.

Pneumococcal Disease
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be adminis-
tered routinely to all adults 65 years of age and older. The
vaccine is also indicated for persons 2 years of age and
older with a normal immune system who have a chronic
illness, including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease,
diabetes, alcoholism, cirrhosis, cerebrospinal fluid leak, or a
cochlear implant.
Pneumococcal Polysaccharide
Vaccine Recommendations
• Adults 65 years of age or older
• Persons 2 years of age or older with
-chronic illness
-anatomic or functional asplenia
-immunocompromised (disease,
chemotherapy, steroids)
-HIV infection
-environments or settings with
increased risk
-cochlear implant
Immunocompromised persons 2 years of age and older
who are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease or
its complications should also be vaccinated. This group
includes persons with splenic dysfunction or absence
(either from disease or surgical removal), Hodgkin disease,
lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure,
nephrotic syndrome (a type of kidney disease), or conditions
such as organ transplantation associated with immunosup-
ression. Persons immunosuppressed from chemotherapy
or high-dose corticosteroid therapy (14 days or longer )
should be vaccinated. Persons 2 years of age and older
with asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV infection should be
vaccinated. Pneumococcal vaccine should be considered for
persons living in special environments or social settings with
an identified increased risk of pneumococcal disease or its
complications, such as certain Native American (i.e., Alaska
Native, Navajo, and Apache) populations.
161
In 2008 ACIP added two new indications for pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine for adults 19 years of age and older.
These new indications are asthma and cigarette smoking.
These groups were added because of evidence of an
increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease. Available
data do NOT support asthma or cigarette smoking as indica-
tions for PPSV23 among persons younger than 19 years.
1
If elective splenectomy or cochlear implant is being consid-
ered, the vaccine should be given at least 2 weeks before
the procedure. If vaccination prior to the procedure is not
feasible, the vaccine should be given as soon as possible
after surgery. Similarly, there should also be a 2-week
interval between vaccination and initiation of cancer chemo-
therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy, if possible.
Providers should not withhold vaccination in the absence of
an immunization record or complete record. The patient's
verbal history may be used to determine vaccination status.
Persons with uncertain or unknown vaccination status
should be vaccinated.
The target groups for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine
and influenza vaccine overlap. These vaccines should
be given at the same time at different sites if indicated,

Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine
All children 2 through 59 months of age should be routinely
vaccinated with PCV13. The primary series beginning in
infancy consists of three doses routinely given at 2, 4, and 6
months of age. The first dose can be administered as early
as 6 weeks of age. A fourth (booster) dose is recommended
at 12–15 months of age. PCV13 should be administered at
the same time as other routine childhood immunizations,
using a separate syringe and injection site. For children
vaccinated at younger than 12 months of age, the minimum
interval between doses is 4 weeks. Doses given at 12 months
of age and older should be separated by at least 8 weeks. A
PCV schedule begun with PCV7 should be completed with
PCV13.

Unvaccinated children 7 months of age and older do not
require a full series of four doses. The number of doses a
child needs to complete the series depends on the child's
current age. Unvaccinated children aged 7 through 11
months should receive two doses of vaccine at least 4 weeks
apart, followed by a booster dose at age 12 thorugh 15
months. Unvaccinated children aged 12 through 23 months
should receive two doses of vaccine, at least 8 weeks apart.
Previously unvaccinated healthy children 24 through 59
months of age should receive a single dose of PCV13.
Unvaccinated children 24 through 71 months of age with
certain chronic medical conditions should receive 2 doses
of PCV13 separated by at least 8 weeks. These conditions
include chronic heart and lung disease, diabetes, cerebro-
spinal fluid leak, cochlear implant, sickle cell disease and
other hemoglobinopathies, functional or anatomic asplenia,
HIV infection, or immunocompromising conditions resulting
from disease or treatment of a disease.
A single supplemental dose of PCV13 is recommended for
all children 14 through 59 months of age who have received
4 doses of PCV7 or another age-appropriate, complete
PCV7 schedule. For children who have an underlying
medical condition, a single supplemental PCV13 dose is
recommended through 71 months. This includes children
who have received PPSV23 previously. PCV13 should be
administered at least 8 weeks after the most recent dose of
PCV7 or PPSV23. This will constitute the final dose of PCV for
these children.

Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
Following vaccination with PPSV23, antibody levels decline
after 5–10 years and decrease more rapidly in some groups
than others. However, the relationship between antibody
titer and protection from invasive disease is not certain
(i.e., higher antibody level does not necessarily mean
better protection), so the ability to define the need for
revaccination based only on serology is limited. In addition,
currently available pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines
elicit a T-cell-independent response, and do not produce a
sustained increase (“boost") in antibody titers. Available data
do not indicate a substantial increase in protection in the
majority of revaccinated persons.

Pneumococcal Vaccines
Contraindications and Precautions
• Severe allergic reaction to
vaccine component or following
prior dose of vaccine
• Moderate or severe acute illness
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
For both pneumococcal polysaccharide and conjugate
vaccines, a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a vaccine
component or following a prior dose is a contraindication
to further doses of vaccine. Such allergic reactions are rare.
Persons with moderate or severe acute illness should not be
vaccinated until their condition improves. However, minor
illnesses, such as upper respiratory infections, are not a
contraindication to vaccination.
The safety of PPSV23 vaccine for pregnant women has not
been studied, although no adverse consequences have been
reported among newborns whose mothers were inadver-
tently vaccinated during pregnancy. Women who are at high
risk of pneumococcal disease and who are candidates for
pneumococcal vaccine should be vaccinated before preg-
nancy, if possible.

Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
The most common adverse reactions following either
pneumococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccine are local
reactions. For PPSV23, 30%-50% of vaccinees report pain,
swelling, or erythema at the site of injection. These reactions
usually persist for less than 48 hours.

Pneumococcal Disease
Local reactions are reported more frequently following a
second dose of PPSV23 vaccine than following the first dose.
Moderate systemic reactions (such as fever and myalgia) are
not common (fewer than 1% of vaccinees), and more severe
systemic adverse reactions are rare.
A transient increase in HIV replication has been reported
following PPSV23 vaccine. No clinical or immunologic dete-
rioration has been reported in these persons.
Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine
Local reactions (such as pain, swelling or redness) following
PCV13 occur in up to half of recipients. Approximately 8% of
local reactions are considered to be severe (e.g., tenderness
that interferes with limb movement). Local reactions are
generally more common with the fourth dose than with the
first three doses. In clinical trials of pneumococcal conjugate
vaccine, fever (higher than 100.4°F (38°C]) within 7 days of
any dose of the primary series was reported for 24%-35% of
children. High fever was reported in less than 1% of vaccine
recipients. Nonspecific symptoms such as decreased appetite
or irritability were reported in up to 80% of recipients.
161
Certain rare adverse events that were observed during
PCV7 postmarketing surveillance are included in the
PCV13 package insert although they were not observed in
the PCV13 clinical trials. These events include hypotonic
hyporesponsive episode, apnea, anaphylactic/anaphylactoid
reaction including shock, angioneurotic edema, erythema
multiforme, injection-site dermatitis, injection-site pruritus,
injection-site urticaria, and lymphadenopathy localized to
the region of the injection site. The causal relation of these
events to vaccination is unknown.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be shipped
in an insulated container with coolant packs. The vaccine
should be stored at refrigerator temperature (35°_46°F
[2_8°C]).
Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine should be stored at
refrigerator temperature. Pneumococcal vaccines must not
be frozen.

Opened multidose vials may be used until the expiration
date printed on the package if they are not visibly contami-
nated.
Goals and Coverage Levels
The Healthy People 2010 goal is to achieve at least 90%
coverage for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine among
persons 65 years of age and older. Data from the 2005

had ever received pneumococcal polysaccharide. Vaccination

age with a chronic illness.

• Vaccination coverage levels were

Opportunities to vaccinate high-risk persons are missed
both at the time of hospital discharge and during visits to
clinicians' offices. Effective programs for vaccine delivery
are needed, including offering the vaccine in hospitals at
discharge and in clinicians' offices, nursing homes, and other
long-term care facilities.
Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
Missed Opportunities
• >65% of patients with severe
pneumococcal disease had been
hospitalized within preceding 3-5
years yet few had received
vaccine
• May be administered
simultaneously with influenza
vaccine
More than 65% of the persons who have been hospitalized
with severe pneumococcal disease had been admitted to a
hospital in the preceding 3–5 years, yet few had received
pneumococcal vaccine. In addition, persons who frequently
visit physicians and who have chronic conditions are more
likely to be at high risk of pneumococcal infection than
those who require infrequent visits. Screening and subse-
quent immunization of hospitalized persons found to be at
high risk could have a significant impact on reducing compli-
cations and death associated with pneumococcal disease.

Poliomyelitis
Poliomyelitis
The words polio (grey) and myelon (marrow, indicating the
spinal cord) are derived from the Greek. It is the effect of
poliomyelitis virus on the spinal cord that leads to the classic
manifestation of paralysis.
Poliomyelitis
• First described by Michael
Underwood in 1789
• First outbreak described in U.S.
in 1843
• More than 21,000 paralytic cases
reported in the U.S. in 1952
• Global eradication within next
decade
Records from antiquity mention crippling diseases compat-
ible with poliomyelitis. Michael Underwood first described
a debility of the lower extremities in children that was
recognizable as poliomyelitis in England in 1789. The first
outbreaks in Europe were reported in the early 19th century,
and outbreaks were first reported in the United States
in 1843. For the next hundred years, epidemics of polio
were reported from developed countries in the Northern
Hemisphere each summer and fall. These epidemics became
increasingly severe, and the average age of persons affected
rose. The increasingly older age of persons with primary
infection increased both the disease severity and number of
deaths from polio. Polio reached a peak in the United States
in 1952, with more than 21,000 paralytic cases. However,
following introduction of effective vaccines, polio incidence
declined rapidly. The last case of wild-virus polio acquired in
the United States was in 1979, and global polio eradication
may be achieved within the next decade.
171
Poliovirus
Poliovirus
Poliovirus is a member of the enterovirus subgroup, family
Picornaviridae. Enteroviruses are transient inhabitants
of the gastrointestinal tract, and are stable at acid pH.
Picornaviruses are small, ether-insensitive viruses with an
RNA genome.
• Enterovirus (RNA)
Three serotypes: 1, 2, 3
• Minimal heterotypic immunity
between serotypes
Rapidly inactivated by heat,
formaldehyde, chlorine, ultraviolet light
There are three poliovirus serotypes (P1, P2, and P3). There is
minimal heterotypic immunity between the three serotypes.
That is, immunity to one serotype does not produce signifi-
cant immunity to the other serotypes.
The poliovirus is rapidly inactivated by heat, formaldehyde,
chlorine, and ultraviolet light.
.
I
Pathogenesis
The virus enters through the mouth, and primary multi-
plication of the virus occurs at the site of implantation in
the pharynx and gastrointestinal tract. The virus is usually
present in the throat and in the stool before the onset of
illness. One week after onset there is less virus in the throat,
but virus continues to be excreted in the stool for several
weeks. The virus invades local lymphoid tissue, enters
the bloodstream, and then may infect cells of the central
nervous system. Replication of poliovirus in motor neurons
of the anterior horn and brain stem results in cell destruc-
tion and causes the typical manifestations of poliomyelitis.

Poliomyelitis
Clinical Features
The incubation period for poliomyelitis is commonly 6 to 20
days with a range of 3 to 35 days.
The response to poliovirus infection is highly variable and
has been categorized on the basis of the severity of clinical
presentation.
Outcomes of poliovirus infection
Up to 95% of all polio infections are inapparent or asymp-
tomatic. Estimates of the ratio of inapparent to paralytic
illness vary from 50:1 to 1,000:1 (usually 200:1). Infected
persons without symptoms shed virus in the stool and are
able to transmit the virus to others.

Percent
Approximately 4%-8% of polio infections consist of a minor,
nonspecific illness without clinical or laboratory evidence of
central nervous system invasion. This clinical presentation
is known as abortive poliomyelitis, and is characterized by
complete recovery in less than a week. Three syndromes
observed with this form of poliovirus infection are upper
respiratory tract infection (sore throat and fever), gastrointes-
tinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, consti-
pation or, rarely, diarrhea), and influenza-like illness. These
syndromes are indistinguishable from other viral illnesses.
Nonparalytic aseptic meningitis (symptoms of stiffness of the
neck, back, and/or legs), usually following several days after
a prodrome similar to that of minor illness, occurs in 1%-2%
of polio infections. Increased or abnormal sensations can
also occur. Typically these symptoms will last from 2 to 10
days, followed by complete recovery.
Fewer than 1% of all polio infections result in flaccid
paralysis. Paralytic symptoms generally begin 1 to 10 days
after prodromal symptoms and progress for 2 to 3 days.
Generally, no further paralysis occurs after the temperature
returns to normal. The prodrome may be biphasic, especially
in children, with initial minor symptoms separated by a
1- to 7-day period from more major symptoms. Additional
prodromal signs and symptoms can include a loss of
superficial reflexes, initially increased deep tendon reflexes
and severe muscle aches and spasms in the limbs or back.
The illness progresses to flaccid paralysis with diminished
deep tendon reflexes, reaches a plateau without change for
days to weeks, and is usually asymmetrical. Strength then
begins to return. Patients do not experience sensory losses or
changes in cognition.
Many persons with paralytic poliomyelitis recover completely
and, in most, muscle function returns to some degree.
Weakness or paralysis still present 12 months after onset is
usually permanent.
Paralytic polio is classified into three types, depending on

Poliomyelitis
the level of involvement. Spinal polio is most common, and
during 1969–1979, accounted for 79% of paralytic cases.
It is characterized by asymmetric paralysis that most often
involves the legs. Bulbar polio leads to weakness of muscles
innervated by cranial nerves and accounted for 2% of cases
during this period. Bulbospinal polio, a combination of
bulbar and spinal paralysis, accounted for 19% of cases.
The death-to-case ratio for paralytic polio is generally 2%-5%
among children and up to 15%-30% for adults (depending
on age). It increases to 25%-75% with bulbar involvement.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Viral Isolation
Poliovirus may be recovered from the stool or pharynx of a
person with poliomyelitis. Isolation of virus from the cere-
brospinal fluid (CSF) is diagnostic, but is rarely accomplished.
If poliovirus is isolated from a person with acute flaccid
paralysis, it must be tested further, using oligonucleotide
mapping (fingerprinting) or genomic sequencing, to deter-
mine if the virus is “wild type” (that is, the virus that causes
polio disease) or vaccine type (virus that could derive from a
vaccine strain).
17
Serology
Neutralizing antibodies appear early and may be at high
levels by the time the patient is hospitalized; therefore, a
fourfold rise in antibody titer may not be demonstrated.
Cerebrospinal Fluid
In poliovirus infection, the CSF usually contains an increased
number of white blood cells (10–200 cells/mm3, primarily
lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein (40–50 mg/100 mL).
Epidemiology
1
Occurrence
At one time poliovirus infection occurred throughout the
world. Transmission of wild poliovirus was interrupted
in the United States in 1979, or possibly earlier. A polio
eradication program conducted by the Pan American Health
Organization led to elimination of polio in the Western
Hemisphere in 1991. The Global Polio Eradication Program
has dramatically reduced poliovirus transmission throughout
the world. In 2009, only 1,579 confirmed cases of polio were
reported globally and polio was endemic in four countries.

Poliomyelitis
Reservoir
Humans are the only known reservoir of poliovirus, which
is transmitted most frequently by persons with inapparent
infections. There is no asymptomatic carrier state except in
immune deficient persons.
Transmission
Person-to-person spread of poliovirus via the fecal-oral route
is the most important route of transmission, although the
oral-oral route may account for some cases.
Temporal Pattern
Poliovirus infection typically peaks in the summer months in
temperate climates. There is no seasonal pattern in tropical
climates.
Poliovirus Epidemiology
• Reservoir
Human
Communicability
Poliovirus is highly infectious, with seroconversion rates
among susceptible household contacts of children nearly
100%, and greater than 90% among susceptible household
contacts of adults. Persons infected with poliovirus are most
infectious from 7 to 10 days before and after the onset of
symptoms, but poliovirus may be present in the stool from
3 to 6 weeks.

Secular Trends in the United States
Before the 18th century, polioviruses probably circulated
widely. Initial infections with at least one type probably
occurred in early infancy, when transplacentally acquired
maternal antibodies were high. Exposure throughout life
probably provided continual boosting of immunity, and
paralytic infections were probably rare. (This view has been
recently challenged based on data from lameness studies
in developing countries).
In the immediate prevaccine era, improved sanitation
allowed less frequent exposure and increased the age of
primary infection. Boosting of immunity from natural
exposure became more infrequent and the number of
susceptible persons accumulated, ultimately resulting in
the occurrence of epidemics, with 13,000 to 20,000 para-
lytic cases reported annually.
In the early vaccine era, the incidence dramatically
decreased after the introduction of inactivated polio vaccine
(IPV) in 1955. The decline continued following oral polio
vaccine (OPV) introduction in 1961. In 1960, a total of 2,525
paralytic cases were reported, compared with 61 in 1965.
The last cases of paralytic poliomyelitis caused by endemic
transmission of wild virus in the United States were in

resident was infected with polio vaccine virus in Costa Rica
and subsequently developed VAPP. A second case of VAPP
from vaccine-derived poliovirus was reported in 2009. Also
in 2005, several asymptomatic infections with a vaccine-
derived poliovirus were detected in unvaccinated children
in Minnesota. The source of the vaccine virus has not been
determined, but it appeared to have been circulating among
humans for at least 2 years based on genetic changes in the
virus. No VAPP has been reported from this virus.

Poliovirus Vaccines
Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) was licensed in 1955 and
was used extensively from that time until the early 1960s.
In 1961, type 1 and 2 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine
(MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed.
In 1963, trivalent OPV was licensed and largely replaced
IPV use. Trivalent OPV was the vaccine of choice in the
United States and most other countries of the world after its
introduction in 1963. An enhanced-potency IPV was licensed
in November 1987 and first became available in 1988. Use of
OPV was discontinued in the United States in 2000.

Inactivated poliovirus vaccine
Two enhanced forms of inactivated poliovirus vaccine are
currently licensed in the U.S., but only one vaccine (IPOL,
sanofi pasteur) is actually distributed. This vaccine contains
all three serotypes of polio vaccine virus. The viruses are
grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (Vero
cell line) and inactivated with formaldehyde. The vaccine
contains 2-phenoxyethanol as a preservative, and trace
amounts of neomycin, streptomycin, and polymyxin B. It

is supplied in a single-dose prefilled syringe and should be
administered by either subcutaneous or intramuscular injec-
tion.
Oral Polio Vaccine
• Contains 3 serotypes of vaccine virus
• Grown on monkey kidney (Vero) cells
• Contains neomycin and streptomycin
• Shed in stool for up to 6 weeks
following vaccination
Oral poliovirus vaccine
Trivalent OPV contains live attenuated strains of all three
serotypes of poliovirus in a 10:1:3 ratio. The vaccine viruses
are grown in monkey kidney tissue culture (Vero cell line).
The vaccine is supplied as a single 0.5-ml dose in a plastic
dispenser. The vaccine contains trace amounts of neomycin
and streptomycin. OPV does not contain a preservative.
Live attenuated polioviruses replicate in the intestinal
mucosa and lymphoid cells and in lymph nodes that drain
the intestine. Vaccine viruses are excreted in the stool of the
vaccinated person for up to 6 weeks after a dose. Maximum
viral shedding occurs in the first 1–2 weeks after vaccination,
particularly after the first dose.
Vaccine viruses may spread from the recipient to contacts.
Persons coming in contact with fecal material of a vaccinated
person may be exposed and infected with vaccine virus.
Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy
Inactivated Polio Vaccine
• Highly effective in producing
immunity to poliovirus
• 90% or more immune after 2 doses
• At least 99% immune after 3 doses
• Duration of immunity not known
with certainty
Inactivated poliovirus vaccine
IPV is highly effective in producing immunity to poliovirus
and protection from paralytic poliomyelitis. Ninety percent
or more of vaccine recipients develop protective antibody
to all three poliovirus types after two doses, and at least
99% are immune following three doses. Protection against
paralytic disease correlates with the presence of antibody.
IPV appears to produce less local gastrointestinal immunity
than does OPV, so persons who receive IPV are more readily
infected with wild poliovirus than OPV recipients.
The duration of immunity with IPV is not known with
certainty, although it probably provides protection for many
years after a complete series.
Oral Polio Vaccine
• Highly effective in producing
immunity to poliovirus
• Approximately 50% immune
after 1 dose
• More than 95% immune after
3 doses
• Immunity probably lifelong
Oral poliovirus vaccine
OPV is highly effective in producing immunity to poliovirus.
A single dose of OPV produces immunity to all three vaccine
viruses in approximately 50% of recipients. Three doses
produce immunity to all three poliovirus types in more than
95% of recipients. As with other live-virus vaccines, immunity
from oral poliovirus vaccine is probably lifelong. OPV
produces excellent intestinal immunity, which helps prevent
infection with wild virus.

Poliomyelitis
Serologic studies have shown that seroconversion following
three doses of either IPV or OPV is nearly 100% to all three
vaccine viruses. However, seroconversion rates after three
doses of a combination of IPV and OPV are lower, particu-
larly to type 3 vaccine virus (as low as 85% in one study).
A fourth dose (most studies used OPV as the fourth dose)
usually produces seroconversion rates similar to three doses
of either IPV or OPV.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Trivalent OPV was the vaccine of choice in the United States
(and most other countries of the world) since it was licensed
in 1963. The nearly exclusive use of OPV led to elimination
of wild-type poliovirus from the United States in less than
20 years. However, one case of VAPP occurred for every 2
to 3 million doses of OPV administered, which resulted in
8 to 10 cases of VAPP each year in the United States (see
Adverse Reactions section for more details on VAPP). From
1980 through 1999, VAPP accounted for 95% of all cases of
paralytic poliomyelitis reported in the United States.
Polio Vaccination
Recommendations, 1996-1999
• Increased use of IPV (sequential IPV-
OPV schedule) recommended in 1996
• Intended to reduce the risk of vaccine-
associated paralytic polio (VAPP)
• Continued risk of VAPP for contacts
of OPV recipients
171
In 1996, ACIP recommended an increase in use of IPV
through a sequential schedule of IPV followed by OPV. This
recommendation was intended to reduce the occurrence of
vaccine-associated paralytic polio. The sequential schedule
was expected to eliminate VAPP among vaccine recipients
by producing humoral immunity to polio vaccine viruses
with inactivated polio vaccine prior to exposure to live
vaccine virus. Since OPV was still used for the third and
fourth doses of the polio vaccination schedule, a risk of VAPP
would continue to exist among contacts of vaccinees, who
were exposed to live vaccine virus in the stool of vaccine
recipients.
Polio Vaccination
Recommendations
• Exclusive use of IPV recommended in
2000
• OPV no longer routinely available in
the United States
• Indigenous VAPP eliminated
1
The sequential IPV-OPV polio vaccination schedule was
widely accepted by both providers and parents. Fewer
cases of VAPP were reported in 1998 and 1999, suggesting
an impact of the increased use of IPV. However, only
the complete discontinuation of use of OPV would lead
to complete elimination of VAPP. To further the goal of
complete elimination of paralytic polio in the United States,
ACIP recommended in July 1999 that inactivated polio
vaccine be used exclusively in the United States beginning
in 2000. OPV is no longer routinely available in the United
States. Exclusive use of IPV eliminated the shedding of live
vaccine virus, and eliminated any indigenous VAPP.
Polio Vaccination Schedule
Minimum
Interval
A primary series of IPV consists of three doses. In infancy,
these primary doses are integrated with the administration
of other routinely administered vaccines. The first dose may
be given as early as 6 weeks of age but is usually given at
2 months of age, with a second dose at 4 months of age.
The third dose should be given at 6–18 months of age. The

recommended interval between the primary series doses is
2 months. However, if accelerated protection is needed, the
minimum interval between each of the first 3 doses of IPV is
4 weeks.
The final dose in the IPV series should be administered at 4
years of age or older. A dose of IPV on or after age 4 years is
recommended regardless of the number of previous doses.
The minimum interval from the next-to-last to final dose is 6
months.
When DTAP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel) is used to provide 4 doses at
ages 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months, an additional booster dose
of age-appropriate IPV-containing vaccine (IPV or DTAP-IPV
[Kinrix]) should be administered at age 4-6 years. This will
result in a 5-dose IPV vaccine series, which is considered
acceptable by ACIP. DTP-IPV/Hib is not indicated for the
booster dose at 4-6 years of age. ACIP recommends that the
minimum interval from dose 4 to dose 5 should be at least 6
months to provide an optimum booster response.

IPV and OPV by 4-6 years of age
constitutes a complete series
.
Shorter intervals between doses and beginning the series
at a younger age may lead to lower seroconversion rates.
Consequently, ACIP recommends the use of the minimum
age (6 weeks) and minimum intervals between doses in the
first 6 months of life only if the vaccine recipient is at risk for
imminent exposure to circulating poliovirus (e.g., during an
outbreak or because of travel to a polio-endemic region).
Combination Vaccines
That Contain IPV
• Pediarix
-DTaP, Hepatitis B and IPV
• Kinrix
-DTaP and IPV
• Pentacel
-DTP, Hib and IPV
Only IPV is available for routine polio vaccination of children
in the United States. A polio vaccination schedule begun with
OPV should be completed with IPV. If a child receives both
types of vaccine, four doses of any combination of IPV or
OPV by 4-6 years of age is considered a complete poliovirus
vaccination series. A minimum interval of 4 weeks should
separate all doses of the series.
Polio Vaccination of Adults
• Routine vaccination of U.S.
residents 18 years of age and older
not necessary or recommended
. May consider vaccination of
travelers to polio-endemic
countries and selected laboratory
workers
There are three combination vaccines that contain inacti-
vated polio vaccine. Pediarix is produced by GlaxoSmithKline
and contains DTap, hepatitis B and IPV vaccines. Pediarix
is licensed for the first 3 doses of the DTP series among
children 6 weeks through 6 years of age. Kinrix is also
produced by GSK and contains DTP and IPV. Kinrix is
licensed only for the fifth dose of DTP and fourth dose
of IPV among children 4 through 6 years of age. Pentacel
is produced by sanofi pasteur and contains DTap, Hib and
IPV. It is licensed for the first four doses of the component
vaccines among children 6 weeks through 4 years of age.
Pentacel is not licensed for children 5 years or older.
Additional information about these combination vaccines is
in the Pertussis chapter of this book.

Poliomyelitis
Polio Vaccination of Adults
Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) who
reside in the United States is not necessary or recommended
because most adults are already immune and have a very
small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in the United States.
Some adults, however, are at increased risk of infection with
poliovirus. These include travelers to areas where polio-
myelitis is endemic or epidemic (currently limited to South
Asia, the eastern Mediterranean, and Africa), laboratory
workers handling specimens that may contain polioviruses,
and healthcare personnel in close contact with patients who
may be excreting wild polioviruses. In addition, members
of specific population groups with a current disease caused
by wild polioviruses (e.g., during an outbreak) are also at
increased risk.
Recommendations for poliovirus vaccination of adults in
the above categories depend upon the previous vaccination
history and the time available before protection is required.
For unvaccinated adults (including adults without a
written record of prior polio vaccination) at increased risk
of exposure to poliomyelitis, primary immunization with
IPV is recommended. The recommended schedule is two
doses separated by 1 to 2 months, and a third dose given
6 to 12 months after the second dose. The minimum
interval between the second and the third doses is 6
months.
Polio Vaccination of
Unvaccinated Adults
• Use standard IPV schedule if
possible (0, 1-2 months, 6-12
months)
May separate first and second doses
by 4 weeks if accelerated schedule
needed
• The minimum interval between the
second and third doses is 6 months
.
17
.
I
In some circumstances time will not allow completion of this
schedule. If 8 weeks or more are available before protection
is needed, three doses of IPV should be given at least 4
weeks apart. If 4 to 8 weeks are available before protection
is needed, two doses of IPV should be given at least 4 weeks
apart. If less than 4 weeks are available before protection
is needed, a single dose of IPV is recommended. In all
instances, the remaining doses of vaccine should be given
later, at the recommended intervals, if the person remains at
increased risk.
Adults who have previously completed a primary series of
3 or more doses and who are at increased risk of exposure
to poliomyelitis should be given one dose of IPV. The need
for further supplementary doses has not been established.
Only one supplemental dose of polio vaccine is recom-
mended for adults who have received a complete series
(i.e., it is not necessary to administer additional doses for
subsequent travel to a polio endemic country).
Polio Vaccination of
Previously Vaccinated Adults
• Previously complete series
-administer one dose of IPV
• Incomplete series
-administer remaining doses in
series
-no need to restart series
Adults who have previously received less than a full
primary course of OPV or IPV and who are at increased
risk of exposure to poliomyelitis should be given the
remaining doses of IPV, regardless of the interval since

the last dose and type of vaccine previously received. It is
not necessary to restart the series of either vaccine if the
schedule has been interrupted.
Polio Vaccine
Contraindications and Precautions
• Severe allergic reaction to a
vaccine component or following a
prior dose of vaccine
• Moderate or severe acute illness
Contraindications And Precautions To
Vaccination
Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a vaccine compo-
nent, or following a prior dose of vaccine, is a contraindica-
tion to further doses of that vaccine. Since IPV contains trace
amounts of streptomycin, neomycin, and polymyxin B, there
is a possibility of allergic reactions in persons sensitive to
these antibiotics. Persons with allergies that are not anaphy-
lactic, such as skin contact sensitivity, may be vaccinated.
Moderate or severe acute illness is a precaution for IPV.
Breastfeeding does not interfere with successful immuniza-
tion against poliomyelitis with IPV. IPV may be administered
to a child with diarrhea. Minor upper respiratory illnesses
with or without fever, mild to moderate local reactions to a
prior dose of vaccine, current antimicrobial therapy, and the
convalescent phase of an acute illness are not contraindica-
tions for vaccination with IPV.
17
Contraindications to combination vaccines that contain
IPV are the same as the contraindications to the individual
components (e.g., DTap, hepatitis B).
Polio Vaccine Adverse Reactions
• Rare local reactions (IPV)
• No serious reactions to IPV have
been documented
• Paralytic poliomyelitis (OPV)
Adverse Reactions Following
Vaccination
Minor local reactions (pain, redness) may occur following IPV.
No serious adverse reactions to IPV have been documented.
Because IPV contains trace amounts of streptomycin,
polymyxin B, and neomycin, allergic reactions may occur in
persons sensitive to these antibiotics.
Vaccine-Associated
Paralytic Pollo
• Increased risk in persons 18 years and
older
• Increased risk in persons with
immunodeficiency
• No procedure available for identifying
persons at risk of paralytic disease
• 5-10 cases per year with exclusive use
of OPV
• Most cases in healthy children and their
household contacts
Vaccine-Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis
Vaccine-associated paralytic polio is a rare adverse reaction
following live oral poliovirus vaccine. Inactivated poliovirus
vaccine does not contain live virus, so it cannot cause VAPP.
The mechanism of VAPP is believed to be a mutation, or
reversion, of the vaccine virus to a more neurotropic form.
These mutated viruses are called revertants. Reversion is
believed to occur in almost all vaccine recipients, but it
only rarely results in paralytic disease. The paralysis that
results is identical to that caused by wild virus, and may be
permanent.
VAPP is more likely to occur in persons 18 years of age and
older than in children, and is much more likely to occur in
immunodeficient children than in those who are immuno-
competent. Compared with immunocompetent children,
258


## p. 259 (#273) ############################################

Poliomyelitis
the risk of VAPP is almost 7,000 times higher for persons
with certain types of immunodeficiencies, particularly
B-lymphocyte disorders (e.g., agammaglobulinemia and
hypogammaglobulinemia), which reduce the synthesis of
immune globulins. There is no procedure available for iden-
tifying persons at risk of paralytic disease, except excluding
older persons and screening for immunodeficiency.
Vaccine-Associated Paralytic
Polio (VAPP) 1980-1998
41%
From 1980 through 1998, 152 cases of paralytic polio were
reported in the United States; 144 (95%) of these cases were
VAPP, and the remaining eight were in persons who acquired
documented or presumed wild-virus polio outside the United
States. Of the 144 VAPP cases, 59 (41%) occurred in healthy
vaccine recipients (average age 3 months). Forty-four (31%)
occurred in healthy contacts of vaccine recipients (average
age 26 years), and 7 (5%) were community acquired (i.e.,
vaccine virus was recovered but there was no known contact
with a vaccine recipient). Thirty-four (24%) of VAPP cases
occurred in persons with immunologic abnormalities (27 in
vaccine recipients and 7 in contacts of vaccine recipients).
None of the vaccine recipients were known to be immuno-
logically abnormal prior to vaccination.
Healthy recipients of OPV
• Healthy contacts of
OPV recipients
• Community acquired
• Immunodeficient
31%
5%
24%
17
The risk of VAPP is not equal for all OPV doses in the
vaccination series. The risk of VAPP is 7 to 21 times higher
for the first dose than for any other dose in the OPV
series. From 1980 through 1994, 303 million doses of OPV
were distributed and 125 cases of VAPP were reported,
for an overall risk of VAPP of one case per 2.4 million
doses. Forty-nine paralytic cases were reported among
immunocompetent recipients of OPV during this period.
The overall risk to these recipients was one VAPP case per
6.2 million OPV doses. However, 40 (82%) of these 49 cases
occurred following receipt of the first dose, making the risk
of VAPP one case per 1.4 million first doses. The risk for
all other doses was one per 27.2 million doses. The reason
for this difference by dose is not known with certainty, but
it is probably because the vaccine virus is able to replicate
longer in a completely nonimmune infant. This prolonged
replication increases the chance of the emergence of a
revertant virus that may cause paralysis. The situation is
similar for contacts. A nonimmune child may shed virus
longer, increasing the chance of exposure of a contact.
The last case of VAPP acquired in the United States was
reported in 1999. As noted previously, a U.S. resident with
VAPP was reported in 2005, but the vaccine virus infection
was acquired in Costa Rica.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
IPV may be shipped without refrigeration provided it is
delivered within 4 days. It should be maintained at 35°-46°F
(29–8°C). The vaccine should be clear and colorless. Any

vaccine showing particulate matter, turbidity, or change in
color should be discarded.
Polio Eradication
Outbreak Investigation and Control
Collect preliminary clinical and epidemiologic information
(including vaccine history and contact with OPV vaccines) on
any suspected case of paralytic polio. Notify CDC, (404-639-
8255) after appropriate local and state health authorities
have been notified. Intensify field investigation to verify
information and collect appropriate specimens for viral isola-
tion and serology.
Last case in United States in 1979
• Western Hemisphere certified polio
free in 1994
• Last isolate of type 2 poliovirus in
India in October 1999
• Global eradication goal
A single case of paralytic poliomyelitis demands immediate
attention. If the evidence indicates vaccine-associated
disease, no outbreak control program is needed. If, however,
evidence indicates wild virus (for example, two cases in a
community), all unvaccinated persons in the epidemic area
who are 6 weeks of age and older and whose vaccine histo-
ries are uncertain should be vaccinated.
Wild Poliovirus 1988

Polio Eradication
Following the widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the
mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly
in many industrialized countries. In the United States, the
number of cases of paralytic poliomyelitis reported annually
declined from more than 20,000 cases in 1952 to fewer than
100 cases in the mid-1960s. The last documented indigenous
transmission of wild poliovirus in the United States was in 1979.
17
Wild Poliovirus 2008
In 1985, the member countries of the Pan American Health
Organization adopted the goal of eliminating poliomyelitis
from the Western Hemisphere by 1990. The strategy to
achieve this goal included increasing vaccination coverage;
enhancing surveillance for suspected cases (i.e., surveillance
for acute flaccid paralysis); and using supplemental immu-
nization strategies such as national immunization days,
house-to-house vaccination, and containment activities.
Since 1991, when the last wild-virus-associated indigenous
case was reported from Peru, no additional cases of poliomy-
elitis have been confirmed despite intensive surveillance. In
September 1994, an international commission certified the
Western Hemisphere to be free of indigenous wild poliovirus.
The commission based its judgment on detailed reports from
national certification commissions that had been convened
in every country in the region.
In 1988, the World Health Assembly (the governing body of
the World Health Organization) adopted the goal of global
eradication of poliovirus by the year 2000. Although this goal
was not achieved, substantial progress has been made. One
type of poliovirus appears to have already been eradicated.
In 1988, an estimated 350,000 cases of paralytic polio
occurred, and the disease was endemic in more than 125

Poliomyelitis
countries. By 2006, fewer than 2,000 cases were reported
globally—a reduction of more than 99% from 1988—and
polio remained endemic in only four countries. In addition,
one type of poliovirus appears to have already been
eradicated. The last isolation of type 2 virus was in India in
October 1999.
The polio eradication initiative is led by a coalition
of international organizations that includes WHO, the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), CDC, and Rotary
International. Other bilateral and multilateral organizations
also support the initiative. Rotary International has contrib-
uted more than $600 million to support the eradication
initiative. Current information on the status of the global
polio eradication initiative is available on the World Health
Organization website at www.polioeradication.org/.
Postpolio Syndrome
After an interval of 30–40 years, 25% 40% of persons who
contracted paralytic poliomyelitis in childhood experience
new muscle pain and exacerbation of existing weakness,
or develop new weakness or paralysis. This disease entity
is referred to as postpolio syndrome. Factors that increase
the risk of postpolio syndrome include increasing length of
time since acute poliovirus infection, presence of permanent
residual impairment after recovery from the acute illness,
and female sex. The pathogenesis of postpolio syndrome
is thought to involve the failure of oversized motor units
created during the recovery process of paralytic poliomy-
elitis. Postpolio syndrome is not an infectious process, and
persons experiencing the syndrome do not shed poliovirus.

Rotavirus
Rotavirus
Rotavirus
Diarrheal disease has been recognized in humans since
antiquity.Until the early 1970s, a bacterial, viral, or parasitic
etiology of diarrheal disease in children could be detected
in fewer than 30% of cases. In 1973, Bishop and colleagues
observed a virus particle in the intestinal tissue of children
with diarrhea by using electron micrography. This virus was
subsequently called “rotavirus” because of its similarity in
appearance to a wheel (rota is Latin for wheel). By 1980,
rotavirus was recognized as the most common cause of
severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children in the
United States. It is now known that infection with rotavirus is
nearly universal, with almost all children infected by 5 years
of age. Rotavirus is responsible for 20–60 deaths per year in
the United States and up to 500,000 deaths from diarrhea
worldwide. A vaccine to prevent rotavirus gastroenteritis
was first licensed in August 1998 but was withdrawn in 1999
because of its association with intussusception. Second-
generation vaccines were licensed in 2006 and 2008.

diarrhea in 1973

diarrhea in infants and children

diarrheal deaths each year
worldwide
Rotavirus
Rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus of the family
Reoviridae. The virus is composed of three concentric shells
that enclose 11 gene segments. The outermost shell contains
two important proteins—VP7, or G-protein, and VP4, or
P-protein. VP7 and VP4 define the serotype of the virus and
induce neutralizing antibody that is probably involved in
immune protection. From 1996 through 2005, five strains
of rotavirus (G1-4, G9) accounted for 90% of isolates from
children younger than 5 years in the United States. Of these,
the G1 strain accounted for more than 75% of isolates.
Rotavirus
• Reovirus (RNA)
• VP7 and VP4 proteins define virus
serotype and induce neutralizing
antibody
• 5 predominant strains in U.S. (G1-G4,
G9) and accounted for 90% of isolates
• G1 strain accounts for 75% of infections
• Very stable and may remain viable for
weeks or months if not disinfected
18
Rotavirus is very stable and may remain viable in the envi-
ronment for weeks or months if not disinfected.
Rotaviruses cause infection in many species of mammals,
including cows and monkeys. These animal strains are anti-
genically distinct from those causing human infection, and
they rarely cause infection in humans.
Rotavirus Pathogenesis
.
Pathogenesis
The virus enters the body through the mouth. Viral replica-
tion occurs in the villous epithelium of the small intestine.
Replication outside the small intestine and systemic spread
of the virus (viremia) are believed to be uncommon in immu-
nocompetent persons. Infection may result in decreased
intestinal absorption of sodium, glucose, and water, and
decreased levels of intestinal lactase, alkaline phosphatase,
and sucrase activity, and may lead to isotonic diarrhea.
Entry through mouth
• Replication in epithelium of small
intestine
• Replication outside intestine and
viremia uncommon
• Infection leads to isotonic diarrhea

poorly understood. Serum and mucosal antibodies against

Rotavirus
Rotavirus Immunity
VP7 and VP4 are probably important for protection from
disease. Cell-mediated immunity probably plays a role in
recovery from infection and in protection.
Antibody against VP7 and VP4
probably important for protection
• First infection usually does not
lead to permanent immunity
• Reinfection can occur at any age
• Subsequent infections generally
less severe
Recovery from a first rotavirus infection usually does not
lead to permanent immunity. After a single natural infec-
tion, 38% of children are protected against any subsequent
rotavirus infection, 77% are protected against rotavirus
diarrhea, and 87% are protected against severe diarrhea.
Reinfection can occur at any age. Subsequent infections
confer progressively greater protection and are generally less
severe than the first. Recurrent rotavirus infections affect
persons of all ages. Recurrent infections are usually asymp-
tomatic or result in mild diarrhea that may be preceded or
accompanied by vomiting and low-grade fever.
Rotavirus Clinical Features
• Short incubation period (usually less
than 48 hours)
• First infection after age 3 months
generally most severe
• May be asymptomatic or result in
severe dehydrating diarrhea with
fever and vomiting
• Gastrointestinal symptoms generally
resolve in 3 to 7 days
Clinical Features
The incubation period for rotavirus diarrhea is short, usually
less than 48 hours. The clinical manifestations of infection
vary and depend on whether it is the first infection or rein-
fection. The first infection after 3 months of age is generally
the most severe. Infection may be asymptomatic, may
cause self-limited watery diarrhea, or may result in severe
dehydrating diarrhea with fever and vomiting. Up to one-
third of infected children may have a temperature greater
than 102°F (39°C). The gastrointestinal symptoms generally
resolve in 3 to 7 days.
18
The clinical features and stool characteristics of rotavirus
diarrhea are nonspecific, and similar illness may be caused
by other pathogens. As a result, confirmation of a diarrheal
illness as rotavirus requires laboratory testing.
Rotavirus Complications
• Severe diarrhea
• Dehydration
• Electrolyte imbalance
• Metabolic acidosis
• Immunodeficient children may
have more severe or prolonged
disease
Complications
Rotavirus infection in infants and young children can lead
to severe diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and
metabolic acidosis. Children who are immunocompromised
because of congenital immunodeficiency or because of
bone marrow or solid organ transplantation may experi-
ence severe or prolonged rotavirus gastroenteritis and may
have evidence of abnormalities in multiple organ systems,
particularly the kidney and liver.
Laboratory Diagnosis
The most widely available method for confirmation of
rotavirus infection is detection of rotavirus antigen in stool
by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Several commercial test kits
are available that detect an antigen common to human
rotaviruses. These kits are simple to use, inexpensive,
and very sensitive. Other techniques (such as electron
microscopy, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction,
nucleic acid hybridization, sequence analysis, and culture)

are used primarily in research settings. Rotavirus antigen has
also been identified in the serum of patients 3–7 days after
disease onset, but at present, routine diagnostic testing is
based primarily on testing of fecal specimens.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Rotavirus occurs throughout the world. The prevalence of
rotavirus strains varies by geographic area, and strains not
included in the vaccine are present in some parts of the
world.
Rotavirus Epidemiology
• Reservoir
Human
• Transmission
Fecal-oral, fomites
• Temporal
pattern
Fall and winter
(temperate areas)
.
Communicability
2 days before to 10
days after onset
Reservoir
The reservoir of rotavirus is the gastrointestinal tract and
stool of infected humans. Although rotavirus infection
occurs in many nonhuman mammals, transmission of
animal rotaviruses to humans is believed to be rare and
probably does not lead to clinical illness. Although immuno-
deficient persons may shed rotavirus for a prolonged period,
a true carrier state has not been described.
18.
Transmission
Rotaviruses are shed in high concentration in the stool of
infected persons. Transmission is by fecal-oral spread, both
through close person-to-person contact and by fomites (such
as toys and other environmental surfaces contaminated by
stool). Rotaviruses are also probably transmitted by other
modes such as fecally contaminated food and water and
respiratory droplets.
.
Temporal Pattern
In temperate climates, disease is more prevalent during
fall and winter. In the United States, annual epidemic
peaks usually progress from the Southwest during
November and December and spread to the Northeast
by April and May. The reason for this seasonal pattern is
unknown. In tropical climates, the disease is less seasonal
than in temperate areas.
1
Communicability
Rotavirus is highly communicable, as evidenced by the
nearly universal infection of children by age 5 years.
Infected persons shed large quantities of virus in their stool
beginning 2 days before the onset of diarrhea and for up to
10 days after onset of symptoms. Rotavirus may be detected
in the stool of immunodeficient persons for more than 30
days after infection. Spread within families, institutions,
hospitals, and child care settings is common.

Rotavirus
Secular Trends in the United States
Rotavirus infection is not nationally notifiable in the United
States. Estimates of incidence and disease burden are based on
special surveys, cohort studies, and hospital discharge data.
Rotavirus Disease in
the United States
• Estimated 3 million cases per year"
• 95% of children infected by 5 years of age
Highest incidence among children 3 to 35
months of age
• Responsible for 5% to 10% of all
gastroenteritis episodes among children
younger than 5 years of age
In the prevaccine era an estimated 3 million rotavirus infec-
tions occurred every year in the United States and 95% of
children experienced at least one rotavirus infection by age 5
years. The incidence of rotavirus is similar in developed and
developing countries, suggesting that improved sanitation
alone is not sufficient to prevent the infection.
"Prevaccine era
Infants younger than 3 months of age have relatively low
rates of rotavirus infection, probably because of passive
maternal antibody, and possibly breastfeeding. The
incidence of clinical illness is highest among children 3 to
35 months of age. Rotavirus infection of adults is usually
asymptomatic but may cause diarrheal illness.
Rotavirus Disease in the
United States
.
Annually* responsible for:
-more than 400,000 physician visits
-more than 200,000 emergency department
visits
-55,000-70,000 hospitalizations
-20-60 deaths
• Annual direct and indirect costs
estimated at approximately $1 billion
In the United States, rotaviruses are responsible for 5% to
10% of all gastroenteritis episodes among children younger
than 5 years of age. However, they are the most common
cause of severe diarrheal disease and account for a higher
proportion of severe episodes leading to clinic or hospital
visits. Rotavirus accounts for 30% to 50% of all hospitaliza-
tions for gastroenteritis among U.S. children younger than
5 years of age, and more than 70% of hospitalizations for
gastroenteritis during the seasonal peaks.
18
* Prevaccine era
In the prevaccine era rotavirus infection was responsible
for more than 400,000 physician visits, more than 200,000
emergency department (ED) visits, 55,000 to 70,000 hospi-
talizations each year, and 20 to 60 deaths. Annual direct and
indirect costs were estimated at approximately $1 billion,
primarily due to the cost of time lost from work to care for
an ill child.
Rotavirus activity in the United States decreased significantly
after introduction of rotavirus vaccine in 2006.
Risk Groups for Rotavirus Infection
• Groups with increased exposure to virus
-children in child care centers
-children in hospital wards
(nosocomial rotavirus)
-caretakers, parents of these children
-children, adults with immuno-
deficiency-related diseases (e.g.,
severe combined immunodeficiency,
HIV, bone marrow transplant)
Groups at increased risk for rotavirus infection are those with
increased exposure to virus. These include children who attend
child care centers, children in hospital wards (nosocomial
rotavirus), caretakers and parents of children in child care or
hospitals, and children and adults with immunodeficiency-
related diseases (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency
disease (SCID), HIV, bone marrow transplant).
Rotavirus Vaccines
The first rotavirus vaccines were derived from either bovine
(cow) or rhesus (monkey) origin. Studies demonstrated that
these live oral vaccines could prevent rotavirus diarrhea in
young children, but efficacy varied widely. Because immunity
to G (VP7) or P (VP4) proteins was associated with disease

Rotavirus
protection and recovery, new live virus vaccines were devel-
oped that incorporated G proteins or both G and P proteins
for each of the predominant serotypes.
In 1998, a rhesus-based tetravalent rotavirus vaccine
(RRV-TV, Rotashield) was licensed and recommended for
routine immunization of U.S. infants. However, RRV-TV
was withdrawn from the U.S. market within 1 year of its
introduction because of its association with intussusception.
The risk of intussusception was most elevated (more than
a 20-fold increase) within 3 to 14 days after receipt of the
first dose of RRV-TV, with a smaller (approximately 5-fold)
increase in risk within 3 to 14 days after the second dose.
Overall, the risk associated with the first dose of RRV-TV
was estimated to be about one case per 10,000 vaccine
recipients. Some researchers have suggested that the risk of
intussusception associated with RRV-TV was age-dependent
and that the absolute number of intussusception events,
and possibly the relative risk of intussusception associated
with the first dose of RRV-TV, increased with increasing age
at vaccination.
Rotavirus Vaccines
Characteristics
There are currently two rotavirus vaccines licensed for use
in the United States. RV5 (RotaTeq) is a live oral vaccine
manufactured by Merck and licensed by the Food and
Drug Administration in February 2006. RV5 contains five
reassortant rotaviruses developed from human and bovine
parent rotavirus strains. Each 2-mL vial of vaccine contains
approximately 2 x 106 infectious units of each of the five
reassortant strains. The vaccine viruses are suspended in a
buffer solution that contains sucrose, sodium citrate, sodium
phosphate monobasic monohydrate, sodium hydroxide,
polysorbate 80, and tissue culture media. Trace amounts of
fetal bovine serum might be present. The vaccine contains
no preservatives or thimerosal.

Rotavirus Vaccines
Fecal shedding of vaccine virus was evaluated in a subset
of persons enrolled in the phase III trials. Vaccine virus was
shed by 9% of 360 infants after dose 1, but none of 249 and
385 infants after doses 2 and 3, respectively. Shedding was
observed as early as 1 day and as late as 15 days after a
dose. The potential for transmission of vaccine virus was not
assessed.

RV1 (Rotarix), a live oral vaccine manufactured by
GlaxoSmithKline, was licensed by the FDA in April 2008. RV1
contains one strain of live attenuated human strain 89-12
(type G1P1A[8]) rotavirus. RV1 is provided as a lyophilized

carbonate, sterile water and xanthan. The vaccine contains
no preservatives or thimerosal.
Fecal shedding of rotavirus antigen was evaluated in all or
a subset of infants from seven studies in various countries.
After dose 1, rotavirus antigen shedding was detected by
ELISA in 50% to 80% (depending on the study) of infants at
approximately day 7 and 0 to 24% at approximately day 30.
After dose 2, rotavirus antigen shedding was detected in
4% to 18% of infants at approximately day 7, and 0 to 1.2%
at approximately day 30. The potential for transmission of
vaccine virus to others was not assessed.

In a large study, the efficacy of RV5 vaccine against rotavirus
gastroenteritis requiring office visits was evaluated among
5,673 children, and efficacy against rotavirus gastroenteritis
requiring ED visits and hospitalizations was evaluated
among 68,038 children during the first 2 years of life. RV5
vaccine reduced the incidence of office visits by 86%, ED
visits by 94%, and hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroen-
teritis by 96%. The efficacy of fewer than three doses is not
known.
Phase III clinical trials of RV1 (Rotarix) efficacy have involved
more than 21,000 infants 6 through 12 weeks of age,
primarily in two studies in Latin America and Europe.
After completion of a two-dose RV1 regimen, the efficacy
of rotavirus vaccine against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis
(Latin America study) was 85%, and against any rotavirus
gastroenteritis (Europe study) was 87%. RV1 reduced
hospitalization for rotavirus gastroenteritis by 85% to 100%
(depending on the study). The efficacy of fewer than two
doses is not known.
Duration of Immunity
The duration of immunity from rotavirus vaccine is not
known. Efficacy through 2 rotavirus seasons has been
studied for both vaccines. In general efficacy is lower in the
second season than in the first.

Rotavirus
Rotavirus Vaccine
Recommendations
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Revised ACIP recommendations for the use of rotavirus
vaccine were published in MMWR in February 2009. Because
of similar estimates of efficacy and safety, neither The
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) nor
the Academies of Pediatrics or Family Physicians state a
preference for one vaccine versus the other.
.
• Routine vaccination of all infants
without a contraindication
2 (RV1) or 3 (RV5) oral doses
beginning at 2 months of age
• Subsequent doses in the series
should be separated from the
previous dose by 1 to 2 months
MMWR 2009;58:(RR-2)
ACIP recommends routine rotavirus vaccination of all infants
without a contraindication. The vaccine should be admin-
istered as a series of either two or three oral doses, for RV1
and RV5, respectively, beginning at 2 months of age. The
vaccination series for both vaccines may be started as early
as 6 weeks of age. Subsequent doses in the series should
be separated from the previous dose by 1 to 2 months.
Rotavirus vaccine should be given at the same visit as other
vaccines given at these ages.
Rotavirus Vaccine
Recommendations
The maximum age for any dose of RV1 approved by the
FDA is 24 weeks, while the maximum FDA-approved age for
any dose of RV5 is 32 weeks. This difference, as well as the
different number of doses in the series could complicate
decisions by clinicians who encounter children who received
a brand of rotavirus vaccine other than the brand the clini-
cian has in stock. There are currently no data on schedules
that include both RV1 and RV5.
• For both rotavirus vaccines
-maximum age for first dose is 14
weeks 6 days
-minimum interval between doses
is 4 weeks
-maximum age for any dose is 8
months 0 days
MMWR 2009:58:(RR-2)
181
|
The ACIP developed age recommendations that vary from
those of the manufacturers. ACIP recommendations state
that the maximum age for the first dose of both vaccines
is 14 weeks 6 days. This is an off-label recommendation
for RV5 since the approved maximum age for the first
dose of that vaccine is 12 weeks. The minimum interval
between doses of both rotavirus vaccines is 4 weeks. The
maximum age for any dose of either rotavirus vaccine is 8
months 0 days. No rotavirus vaccine should be administered
to infants older than 8 months 0 days of age. This is an
off-label recommendation for both vaccines, because the
labeled maximum age for RV1 is 24 weeks, and the labeled
maximum age for RV5 is 32 weeks.
Rotavirus Vaccine
Recommendations
• ACIP did not define a maximum
interval between doses
• If the interval between doses is
prolonged, the infant can still receive
the vaccine as long as it can be
given on or before the infant's 8-
month birthday
• It is not necessary to restart the
series or add doses because of a
prolonged interval between doses
MMWR 2009:58:(RR-2)
ACIP did NOT define a maximum interval between doses. It
is preferable to adhere to the recommended interval of 8
weeks. But if the interval is prolonged, the infant can still
receive the vaccine as long as it can be given on or before
the 8-month birthday. It is not necessary to restart the series
or add doses because of a prolonged interval between doses.
Rotavirus Vaccine
C
There are few data on the safety or efficacy of giving more
than one dose, even partial doses, close together. ACIP
recommends that providers not repeat the dose if the infant
spits out or regurgitates the vaccine. Any remaining doses
should be administered on schedule. Doses of rotavirus
vaccine should be separated by at least 4 weeks.
• ACIP recommends that providers not

Rotavirus
Rotavirus Vaccine
Recommendations
Complete the series with the same
product whenever possible
• If product used for a prior dose or doses
is not available or not known, continue or
complete the series with the product that
is available
• If any dose in the series was RV5
(Rotá Teq) or the vaccine brand used for
any prior dose is not known, a total of 3
doses of rotavirus vaccine should be
administered
ACIP recommends that the rotavirus vaccine series should
be completed with the same product whenever possible.
However, vaccination should not be deferred if the product
used for a prior dose or doses is not available or is not
known. In this situation, the provider should continue or
complete the series with the product that is available. If any
dose in the series was RV5 (Rotateq) or the vaccine brand
used for any prior dose in the series is not known, a total of
three doses of rotavirus vaccine should be administered.
MWR 2009:58:(RR-2)
Breastfeeding does not appear to diminish immune response
to rotavirus vaccine. Infants who are being breastfed should
be vaccinated on schedule.
Rotavirus Vaccine
Recommendations
• Infants documented to have had
rotavirus gastroenteritis before
receiving the full course of rotavirus
vaccinations should still begin or
complete the 2- or 3-dose schedule
There are at least 5 serotypes of rotavirus that may cause diar-
rheal disease in the United States. In addition, infants may
experience multiple episodes of rotavirus diarrhea because
the initial infection may provide only partial immunity.
Infants documented to have had rotavirus gastroenteritis
before receiving the full course of rotavirus vaccinations
should still begin or complete the 2- or 3-dose schedule.
MMWR 2009.58 (RR-2)
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Rotavirus vaccine is contraindicated for infants who are
known to have had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic)
to a vaccine component or following a prior dose of
vaccine. Latex rubber is contained in the RV1 oral appli
cator, so infants with a severe allergy to latex should not
receive RV1. The RVS dosing tube is latex free.
18
Rotavirus Vaccine
Contraindications
Severe allergic reaction to a
vaccine component (including
latex) or following a prior dose of
vaccine
-latex rubber is contained in the
RV1 oral applicator
Precaution conditions are those that may increase the
chance of a vaccine adverse reaction or reduce the efficacy
of the vaccine. In general, infants with precautions to vacci-
nation, described below, should not receive the vaccine
until the condition improves unless the benefit of vaccina-
tion outweighs the risk of an adverse reaction. However,
clinicians may consider use of the vaccine on a case-by-case
basis.
Rotavirus Vaccine
Precautions*
• Altered immunocompetence
• Acute, moderate or severe
gastroenteritis or other acute illness
• History of intussusception
Children who are immunocompromised because of
congenital immunodeficiency, or hematopoietic stem cell
or solid organ transplantation sometimes experience severe,
prolonged, and even fatal rotavirus gastroenteritis. However,
no safety or efficacy data are available regarding administra-
tion of rotavirus vaccine to infants who are, or are poten-
tially immunocompromised due to either disease or drugs.
Clinicians will need to use their judgment in this situation.
However, rotavirus is contraindicated in infants diagnosed
with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).
*The decision to vaccinate if a precaution is present should
be made on a case-by-case risk and benefit basis.
There are no data on the use of rotavirus vaccine among
infants who are exposed to or infected with HIV. However,
two considerations support vaccination of these infants.
270


## p. 271 (#285) ############################################

Rotavirus
First, the HIV diagnosis might not be established in infants
born to HIV-infected mothers by the time they reach the age
of the first rotavirus vaccine dose. Only 3% percent or less of
HIV-exposed infants in the United States will be determined
to be HIV infected. Second, vaccine strains of rotavirus are
considerably attenuated, and exposure to an attenuated
rotavirus is preferable to exposure to wild-type rotavirus.
Rotavirus Vaccino - Conditions Not
Considered to be Precautions
Rotavirus vaccine should generally not be administered to
infants with acute, moderate or severe gastroenteritis, or
other acute illness until the condition improves. However,
infants with mild acute gastroenteritis or other mild acute
illness can be vaccinated, particularly if the delay in vaccina-
tion will delay the first dose of vaccine beyond 15 weeks 0
days of age.
• Pre-existing chronic gastrointestinal
conditions
-no data available
-ACIP considers the benefits of vaccination
to outweigh the theoretic risks
• Recent receipt of an antibody-containing
blood product
-no data available
-ACIP recommends that rotavirus vaccine
may be administered at any time before,
concurrent with, or after administration of
any blood product
Available data suggest that infants with a history of intus-
susception might be at higher risk for a repeat episode than
other infants. Until postlicensure data on the safety of rota-
virus vaccine are available, the risks for and the benefits of
vaccination should be considered when vaccinating infants
with a previous episode of intussusception.
No data are available on the immune response to rotavirus
vaccine in infants who have recently received a blood
product. In theory, infants who have recently received an
antibody-containing blood product might have a reduced
immunologic response to a dose of oral rotavirus vaccine.
However, 2 or 3 doses of vaccine are administered in the full
rotavirus vaccine series, and no increased risk for adverse
events is expected. ACIP now recommends that rotavirus
vaccine may be administered at any time before, concurrent
with, or after administration of any blood product.
181
Rotavirus Vaccine and
Preterm Infants
• ACIP supports vaccination of a
preterm infant if:
-chronological age is at least 6
weeks
-clinically stable; and
-vaccine is administered at time
of discharge or after discharge
from neonatal intensive care unit
or nursery
Available data suggest that preterm infants (i.e., infants
born at less than 37 weeks' gestation) are at increased risk
for hospitalization from rotavirus during the first 1 to 2
years of life. In clinical trials, rotavirus vaccine appeared to
be generally well tolerated in preterm infants, although a
relatively small number of preterm infants have been evalu-
ated. ACIP considers the benefits of rotavirus vaccination
of preterm infants to outweigh the risks of adverse events.
ACIP supports vaccination of a preterm infant according to
the same schedule and precautions as a full-term infant,
provided the following conditions are met: the infant's
chronological age is at least 6 weeks, the infant is clinically
stable, and the vaccine is administered at the time of
discharge or after discharge from the neonatal intensive
care unit or nursery. Although the lower level of maternal
antibody to rotavirus in very preterm infants theoretically
could increase the risk for adverse reactions from rotavirus
vaccine, ACIP believes the benefits of vaccinating the infant
when age eligible, clinically stable, and no longer in the
hospital outweigh the theoretic risks.
271


## p. 272 (#286) ############################################

Rotavirus
Vaccine strains of rotavirus are shed in the feces of vaccinated
infants. So if an infant were to be vaccinated with rotavirus
vaccine while still needing care in the hospital, a theoretic
risk exists for vaccine virus being transmitted to infants in the
same unit who are acutely ill, and to preterm infants who
are not age eligible for vaccine. ACIP considers that, in usual
circumstances, the risk from shedding outweighs the benefit
of vaccinating an infant who will remain in the hospital and
recommends that these infants not be vaccinated until they
meet the conditions described above.

Immunosupprossod Household Contacts
of Rotavirus Vaccino Rocipionts
• Infants living in households with
persons who have or are suspected
of having an immunodeficiency
disorder or impaired immune status
can be vaccinated
• Protection provided by vaccinating
the infant outweighs the small risk of
transmitting vaccine virus
Although rotavirus is shed in the feces of vaccinated infants
transmission of vaccine virus has not been documented.
Infants living in households with persons who have or
are suspected of having an immunodeficiency disorder or
impaired immune status can be vaccinated. ACIP believes
that the indirect protection of the immunocompromised
household member provided by vaccinating the infant in
the household, and thereby preventing wild-type rotavirus
disease, outweighs the small risk for transmitting vaccine
virus to the immunocompromised household member.
Pregnant Household Contacts of
Rotavirus Vaccine Recipients
Infants living in households with pregnant women should
be vaccinated according to the same schedule as infants in
households without pregnant women. Because the majority
of women of childbearing age have preexisting immunity
to rotavirus, the risk for infection by the attenuated vaccine
virus is considered to be very low. Although transmission of
vaccine virus has not been documented, it is prudent for all
members of the household to employ measures such as good
hand washing after changing a diaper or otherwise coming
in contact with the feces of the vaccinated infant.

Other Adverse Events
A variety of other adverse reactions were reported during

Storage and Handling
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Both rotavirus vaccines must be stored at refrigerator
temperatures (35°46°F 12°–8°C]) and protected from
light. RV1 diluent may be stored at room temperature. The
vaccines must not be frozen. The shelf life of properly stored
vaccine is 24 months. RV5 should be administered as soon
as possible after being removed from refrigeration. RV1
should be administered within 24 hours of reconstitution.
Reconstituted RV1 may be stored at refrigerator or room
temperature.
• Store at 350- 46° F (2-8°C) and protect
from light
• RV1 diluent may be stored at room
temperature
• Do not freeze vaccines
• Administer RVS as soon as possible after
being removed from refrigeration
• RV1 should be administered within 24
hours of reconstitution
181
Healthcare personnel may be concerned about exposure to
vaccine virus during administration of rotavirus vaccine or
contact with vaccinated infants. Hand hygiene using soap
and water or alcohol-based hand cleaners should already be
standard practice wherever vaccines are being administered.
This practice should minimize the risk of transmission of
rotavirus vaccine virus during administration. Therefore,
there are no restrictions on immunosuppressed or pregnant
healthcare personnel administering the vaccine.
Rotavirus Surveillance
Rotavirus gastroenteritis is not a reportable disease in the
United States, and testing for rotavirus infection is not
always performed when a child seeks medical care for
acute gastroenteritis. Rotavirus disease surveillance systems
need to be adequately sensitive and specific to document
the effectiveness of the vaccination program. Methods
of surveillance for rotavirus disease at the national level
include review of national hospital discharge databases for
rotavirus-specific or rotavirus-compatible diagnoses, surveil-
lance for rotavirus disease at three sites that participate
in the New Vaccine Surveillance Network, and reports of
rotavirus detection from a sentinel system of laboratories.
At the state and local levels, surveillance efforts at sentinel
hospitals or by review of hospital discharge databases can

Rotavirus
be used to monitor the impact of the vaccine program.
Special studies (e.g., case-control studies and retrospective
cohort studies) will be used to measure the effectiveness
of rotavirus vaccine under routine use in the United States.
CDC has established a national strain surveillance system of
sentinel laboratories to monitor circulating rotavirus strains
before and after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine. This
system is designed to detect new or unusual strains causing
gastroenteritis that might not be prevented effectively by
vaccination, which might affect the success of the vaccina-
tion program.

Rubella
Rubella
• From Latin meaning "little red"
Rubella
The name rubella is derived from Latin, meaning "little red.”
Rubella was initially considered to be a variant of measles
or scarlet fever and was called “third disease.” It was not
until 1814 that it was first described as a separate disease
in the German medical literature, hence the common name
“German measles." In 1914, Hess postulated a viral etiology
based on his work with monkeys. Hiro and Tosaka in 1938
confirmed the viral etiology by passing the disease to children
using filtered nasal washings from persons with acute cases.
· Discovered in 18th century - thought
to be variant of measles
.
First described as distinct clinical
entity in German literature
• Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)
described by Gregg in 1941
Following a widespread epidemic of rubella infection
in 1940, Norman Gregg, an Australian ophthalmologist,
reported in 1941 the occurrence of congenital cataracts
among 78 infants born following maternal rubella infection
in early pregnancy. This was the first published recognition
of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Rubella virus was first
isolated in 1962 by Parkman and Weller. The first rubella
vaccines were licensed in 1969.
Rubella Virus
• Togavirus
• RNA virus
Rubella Virus
Rubella virus is classified as a togavirus, genus Rubivirus.
It is most closely related to group A arboviruses, such as
eastern and western equine encephalitis viruses. It is an
enveloped RNA virus, with a single antigenic type that does
not cross-react with other members of the togavirus group.
Rubella virus is relatively unstable and is inactivated by lipid
solvents, trypsin, formalin, ultraviolet light, low pH, heat,
and amantadine.

Rubella Pathogenesis
.
Respiratory transmission of virus
Pathogenesis
Following respiratory transmission of rubella virus, replica-
tion of the virus is thought to occur in the nasopharynx and
regional lymph nodes. A viremia occurs 5 to 7 days after
exposure with spread of the virus throughout the body.
Transplacental infection of the fetus occurs during viremia.
Fetal damage occurs through destruction of cells as well as
mitotic arrest.
• Replication in nasopharynx and
regional lymph nodes
• Viremia 5-7 days after exposure
with spread to tissues
• Placenta and fetus infected
during viremia
Clinical Features
Rubella Clinical Features
I
Acquired Rubella
The incubation period of rubella is 14 days, with a range
of 12 to 23 days. Symptoms are often mild, and up to 50%
of infections may be subclinical or inapparent. In children,
rash is usually the first manifestation and a prodrome is
rare. In older children and adults, there is often a 1 to 5 day
prodrome with low-grade fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy,
and upper respiratory symptoms preceding the rash. The
rash of rubella is maculopapular and occurs 14 to 17 days
after exposure. The rash usually occurs initially on the

face and then progresses from head to foot. It lasts about
3 days and is occasionally pruritic. The rash is fainter than
measles rash and does not coalesce. The rash is often more
prominent after a hot shower or bath. Lymphadenopathy
may begin a week before the rash and last several weeks.
Postauricular, posterior cervical, and suboccipital nodes are
commonly involved.
Arthralgia and arthritis occur so frequently in adults that
they are considered by many to be an integral part of
the illness rather than a complication. Other symptoms
of rubella include conjunctivitis, testalgia, or orchitis.
Forschheimer spots may be noted on the soft palate but are
not diagnostic for rubella.

Complications of rubella are not common, but they gener-
ally occur more often in adults than in children.

A rubella epidemic in the United States in 1964–1965
resulted in 12.5 million cases of rubella infection and
about 20,000 newborns with CRS. The estimated cost of
the epidemic was $840 million. This does not include the
emotional toll on the families involved.
Infection with rubella virus is most severe in early gesta-
tion. The virus may affect all organs and cause a variety

Infection may affect all organs
of congenital defects. Infection may lead to fetal death,
spontaneous abortion, or premature delivery. The severity of
the effects of rubella virus on the fetus depends largely on
the time of gestation at which infection occurs. As many as
85% of infants infected in the first trimester of pregnancy will
be found to be affected if followed after birth. While fetal
infection may occur throughout pregnancy, defects are rare
when infection occurs after the 20th week of gestation. The
overall risk of defects during the third trimester is probably no
greater than that associated with uncomplicated pregnancies.

Congenital Rubella Syndrome
Congenital infection with rubella virus can affect virtually all
organ systems. Deafness is the most common and often the
sole manifestation of congenital rubella infection, especially
after the fourth month of gestation. Eye defects, including
cataracts, glaucoma, retinopathy, and microphthalmia may
occur. Cardiac defects such as patent ductus arteriosus,
ventricular septal defect, pulmonic stenosis, and coarcta-
tion of the aorta are possible. Neurologic abnormalities,
including microcephaly and mental retardation, and other
abnormalities, including bone lesions, splenomegaly, hepa-
titis, and thrombocytopenia with purpura may occur.

Manifestations of CRS may be delayed from 2 to 4 years.
Diabetes mellitus appearing in later childhood occurs
frequently in children with CRS. In addition, progressive
encephalopathy resembling subacute sclerosing panenceph-
alitis has been observed in some older children with CRS.
Children with CRS have a higher than expected incidence of
autism.
191
Infants with CRS may have low titers by hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) but may have high titers of neutralizing
antibody that may persist for years. Reinfection may occur.
Impaired cell-mediated immunity has been demonstrated in
some children with CRS.
Rubella Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory Diagnosis
Many rash illnesses can mimic rubella infection, and as
many as 50% of rubella infections may be subclinical. The
only reliable evidence of acute rubella infection is a positive
viral culture for rubella or detection of rubella virus by
polymerase chain reaction, the presence of rubella-specific
IgM antibody, or demonstration of a significant rise in IgG
antibody from paired acute- and convalescent-phase sera.
• Isolation of rubella virus from clinical
specimen (e.g., nasopharynx, urine)
• Positive serologic test for rubella IgM
antibody
Significant rise in rubella IgG by any
standard serologic assay (e.g.,
enzyme immunoassay)
Rubella virus can be isolated from nasal, blood, throat,
urine and cerebrospinal fluid specimens from rubella and
CRS patients. Virus may be isolated from the pharynx 1 week
before and until 2 weeks after rash onset. Although isolation
of the virus is diagnostic of rubella infection, viral cultures
are labor intensive, and therefore not done in many labora-
tories; they are generally not used for routine diagnosis of

Rubella
rubella. Viral isolation is an extremely valuable epidemio-
logic tool and should be attempted for all suspected cases of
rubella or CRS. Information about rubella virus isolation can
be found on the CDC website at www.cdc.gov/rubella/lab/
lab-protocols.htm.
Serology is the most common method of confirming the
diagnosis of rubella. Acute rubella infection can be serologi-
cally confirmed by a significant rise in rubella antibody titer
in acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens or by the
presence of serum rubella IgM. Serum should be collected
as early as possible (within 7-10 days) after onset of illness,
and again 14–21 days (minimum of 7) days later.
False-positive serum rubella IgM tests have occurred in
persons with parvovirus infections, with a positive hetero-
phile test for infectious mononucleosis, or with a positive
rheumatoid factor.
The serologic tests available for laboratory confirmation of
rubella infections vary among laboratories. The state health
department can provide guidance on available laboratory
services and preferred tests.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA is sensi-
tive, widely available, and relatively easy to perform. It can
also be modified to measure IgM antibodies. Most of the
diagnostic testing done for rubella antibodies uses some
variation of ELISA.

Rubella
Communicability
Rubella is only moderately contagious. The disease is most
contagious when the rash first appears, but virus may be
shed from 7 days before to 5–7 days or more after rash
onset.
Infants with CRS shed large quantities of virus from body
secretions for up to 1 year and can therefore transmit
rubella to persons caring for them who are susceptible to
the disease.

CRS Cases
Secular Trends in the United States
Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome became nationally
notifiable diseases in 1966. The largest annual total of cases
of rubella in the United States was in 1969, when 57,686
cases were reported (58 cases per 100,000 population).
Following vaccine licensure in 1969, rubella incidence
declined rapidly. By 1983, fewer than 1,000 cases per year
were reported (less than 0.5 cases per 100,000 population).
A moderate resurgence of rubella occurred in 1990–1991,
primarily due to outbreaks in California (1990) and among
the Amish in Pennsylvania (1991). In 2003, a record low
annual total of seven cases was reported. In October 2004,
CDC convened an independent expert panel to review avail-
able rubella and CRS data. After a careful review, the panel
unanimously agreed that rubella was no longer endemic in
the United States.

CRS Cases
Until recently, there was no predominant age group for
rubella cases. From 1982 through 1992, approximately 30%
of cases occurred in each of three age groups: younger than
5, 5–14, and 15–39 years. Adults 40 years of age and older
typically accounted for less than 10% of cases. However,
since 1993, persons 15–39 years of age have accounted for
more than half the cases. In 2003, this age group accounted
for 71% of all reported cases.

CRS surveillance is maintained through the National
Congenital Rubella Registry, which is managed by the
National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
The largest annual total of reported CRS cases to the registry
was in 1970 (67 cases). An average of 5–6 CRS cases have
been reported annually since 1980. Although reported
rubella activity has consistently and significantly decreased
since vaccine has been used in the United States, the
incidence of CRS has paralleled the decrease in rubella
cases only since the mid-1970s. The decline in CRS since
the mid-1970s was due to an increased effort to vaccinate

Characteristics
The RA 27/3 rubella vaccine is a live attenuated virus. It was
first isolated in 1965 at the Wistar Institute from a rubella-
infected aborted fetus. The virus was attenuated by 25–30
passages in tissue culture, using human diploid fibroblasts.
It does not contain duck, chicken or egg protein.

Vaccine virus is not communicable except in the setting of
breastfeeding (see Contraindications, below), even though
virus may be cultured from the nasopharynx of vaccinees.
Rubella vaccine is available combined with measles and
mumps vaccines as MMR, or combined with mumps,
measles, and varicella vaccine as MMRV (ProQuad). The
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
recommends that combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine
(MMR) be used when any of the individual components is
indicated. Single-antigen rubella vaccine is not available in
the U.S.
MMR and MMRV are supplied as a lyophylized (freeze-dried)
powder and are reconstituted with sterile, preservative-free
water. The vaccines contains a small amount of human
albumin, neomycin, sorbitol, and gelatin.

## p. 281 (#295) ############################################

Rubella
Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy
RA 27/3 rubella vaccine is safe and more immunogenic
than rubella vaccines used previously. In clinical trials,
95% or more of vaccinees aged 12 months and older
developed serologic evidence of rubella immunity after
a single dose. More than 90% of vaccinated persons have
protection against both clinical rubella and viremia for at
least 15 years. Follow-up studies indicate that one dose of
vaccine confers long-term, probably lifelong, protection.
Seroconversion rates are similar for single-antigen rubella
vaccine, MMR, and MMRV.
Several reports indicate that viremic reinfection following
exposure may occur in vaccinated persons who have
low levels of detectable antibody. The frequency and
consequences of this phenomenon are unknown, but it
is believed to be uncommon. Rarely, clinical reinfection
and fetal infection have been reported among women
with vaccine-induced immunity. Rare cases of CRS have
occurred among infants born to women who had docu-
mented serologic evidence of rubella immunity before
they became pregnant.
Rubella Vaccine (MMR) Indications
Vaccination Schedule and Use
At least one dose of rubella-containing vaccine, as combi-
nation MMR (or MMRV) vaccine, is routinely recommended
for all children 12 months of age or older. All persons born
during or after 1957 should have documentation of at
least one dose of MMR. The first dose of MMR should be
given on or after the first birthday. Any dose of rubella-
containing vaccine given before 12 months of age should
not be counted as part of the series. Children vaccinated
with rubella-containing vaccine before 12 months of
age should be revaccinated when the child is at least 12
months of age.
All infants 12 months of age and
older
Susceptible adolescents and
adults without documented
evidence of rubella immunity
• Emphasis on nonpregnant women
of childbearing age, particularly
those born outside the U.S.
19.
O
A second dose of MMR is recommended to produce
immunity to measles and mumps in those who failed to
respond to the first dose. Data indicate that almost all
persons who do not respond to the measles component
of the first dose will respond to a second dose of MMR.
Few data on the immune response to the rubella and
mumps components of a second dose of MMR are avail-
able. However, most persons who do not respond to the
rubella or mumps component of the first MMR dose would
be expected to respond to the second dose. The second
dose is not generally considered a booster dose because a
primary immune response to the first dose provides long-
term protection. Although a second dose of vaccine may
increase antibody titers in some persons who responded
to the first dose, available data indicate that these
increased antibody titers are not sustained. The combined
281

Rubella
MMR vaccine is recommended for both doses to ensure
immunity to all three viruses.
The second dose of MMR vaccine should routinely be given
at age 4 through 6 years, before a child enters kinder-
garten or first grade. The recommended health visit at age
11 or 12 years can serve as a catch-up opportunity to verify
vaccination status and administer MMR vaccine to those
children who have not yet received two doses of MMR
(with the first dose administered no earlier than the first
birthday). The second dose of MMR may be administered
as soon as 1 month (i.e., minimum of 28 days) after the
first dose. The minimum interval between doses of MMRV
is 3 months.
All older children not previously immunized should receive
at least one dose of rubella vaccine as MMR or MMRV if 12
years of age or younger.
Adults born in 1957 or later who do not have a medical
contraindication should receive at least one dose of MMR
vaccine unless they have documentation of vaccination
with at least one dose of measles-, mumps-, and rubella-
containing vaccine or other acceptable evidence of immunity
to these three diseases. Some adults at high risk of measles
and mumps exposure may require a second dose. This
second dose should be administered as combined MMR
vaccine (see Measles chapter for details). Efforts should be
made to identify and vaccinate susceptible adolescents
and adults, particularly women of childbearing age who
are not pregnant. Particular emphasis should be placed on
vaccinating both males and females in colleges, places of
employment, and healthcare settings.
19
Only doses of vaccine with written documentation of the
date of receipt should be accepted as valid. Self-reported
doses or a parental report of vaccination is not considered
adequate documentation. A healthcare provider should not
provide an immunization record for a patient unless that
healthcare provider has administered the vaccine or has
seen a record that documents vaccination. Persons who lack
adequate documentation of vaccination or other acceptable
evidence of immunity should be vaccinated. Vaccination
status and receipt of all vaccinations should be documented
in the patient's permanent medical record and in a vaccina-
tion record held by the individual.
MMRV is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
children 12 months through 12 years of age (that is, until the
13th birthday). MMRV should not be administered to persons
13 years or older.

## p. 283 (#297) ############################################

Rubella
For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella
vaccines at age 12 through 47 months, either MMR vaccine
and varicella vaccine or MMRV vaccine may be used.
Providers who are considering administering MMRV vaccine
should discuss the benefits and risks of both vaccination
options with the parents or caregivers. Unless the parent
or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV vaccine, CDC
recommends that MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine should
be administered for the first dose in this age group. For
the second dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella
vaccines at any age (15 months through 12 years) and for
the first dose at 48 months of age or older, use of MMRV
vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of
its equivalent component vaccines (i.e., MMR vaccine and
varicella vaccine).
Rubella Immunity
Rubella Immunity
Persons generally can be considered immune to rubella if
they have documentation of vaccination with at least one
dose of MMR (or MMRV) or other live rubella-containing
vaccine administered on or after their first birthday, have
serologic evidence of rubella immunity, or were born before
1957. Persons who have an “equivocal” serologic test result
should be considered rubella-susceptible. Although only one
dose of rubella-containing vaccine is required as acceptable
evidence of immunity to rubella, children should receive two
doses of MMR vaccine according to the routine childhood
vaccination schedule.
Documentation of one dose of
rubella-containing vaccine on or
after the first birthday
.
Serologic evidence of immunity
• Birth before 1957 (except women
of childbearing age)
19
Rubella Immunity
Birth before 1957 provides only presumptive evidence of
rubella immunity; it does not guarantee that a person is
immune to rubella. Because rubella can occur in some
unvaccinated persons born before 1957 and because
congenital rubella and congenital rubella syndrome can
occur in the offspring of women infected with rubella
during pregnancy, birth before 1957 is not acceptable
evidence of rubella immunity for women who might
become pregnant. Only a positive serologic test for rubella
antibody or documentation of appropriate vaccination
should be accepted for women who may become pregnant.
• Birth before 1957 is not
acceptable evidence of rubella
immunity for women who might
become pregnant
• Only serology or documented
vaccination should be accepted
1
Healthcare personnel born before 1957 also should not be
presumed to be immune. Medical facilities should consider
recommending at least one dose of MMR vaccine to unvac-
cinated healthcare personnel born before 1957 who do
not have laboratory evidence of rubella immunity. Rubella
vaccination or laboratory evidence of rubella immunity
is particularly important for healthcare personnel who
could become pregnant, including those born before 1957.
This recommendation is based on serologic studies which
283


## p. 284 (#298) ############################################

Rubella
indicate that among hospital personnel born before 1957,
5% to 9% had no detectable measles antibody.
Clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable and should not
be considered in assessing immune status. Because many
rash illnesses may mimic rubella infection and many
rubella infections are unrecognized, the only reliable
evidence of previous rubella infection is the presence of
serum rubella IgG antibody. Laboratories that regularly
perform antibody testing are generally the most reliable
because their reagents and procedures are strictly stan-
dardized.
Occasionally, a person with a history of documented rubella
vaccination is found to have a negative serum IgG by ELISA.
Such persons may be given a dose of MMR vaccine and do
not need to be retested for serologic evidence of rubella
immunity.
Serologic screening need not be done before vaccinating for
measles and rubella unless the medical facility considers
it cost-effective. Serologic testing is appropriate only if
tracking systems are used to ensure that tested persons who
are identified as susceptible are subsequently vaccinated
in a timely manner. If the return and timely vaccination of
those screened cannot be assured, vaccination should be
done without prior testing. Serologic testing for immunity
to measles and rubella is not necessary for persons docu-
mented to be appropriately vaccinated or who have other
acceptable evidence of immunity.
19
Neither rubella vaccine nor immune globulin is effective
for postexposure prophylaxis of rubella. Vaccination after
exposure is not harmful and may possibly avert later
disease.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Persons who have experienced a severe allergic reaction
(anaphylaxis) to a vaccine compnent or following a prior
dose of rubella vaccine should generally not be vaccinated
with MMR.
MMR Vaccine
Contraindications and Precautions
.
• Severe allergic reaction to vaccine
component or following prior dose
• Pregnancy
Immunosuppression
• Moderate or severe acute illness
• Recent blood product
• Personal or family (i.e., sibling or
parent) history of seizures of any
etiology (MMRV only)
Women known to be pregnant or attempting to become
pregnant should not receive rubella vaccine. Although
there is no evidence that rubella vaccine virus causes fetal
damage, pregnancy should be avoided for 4 weeks (28 days)
after rubella or MMR vaccination.
Persons with immunodeficiency or immunosuppression,
resulting from leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malig-
nancy, immune deficiency disease, or immunosuppressive
therapy should not be vaccinated. However, treatment with
284


## p. 285 (#299) ############################################

Rubella
low-dose (less than 2 mg/kg/day), alternate-day, topical, or
aerosolized steroid preparations is not a contraindication
to rubella vaccination. Persons whose immunosuppressive
therapy with steroids has been discontinued for 1 month
(3 months for chemotherapy) may be vaccinated. Rubella
vaccine should be considered for persons with asymptomatic
or mildly symptomatic HIV infection.
Persons with moderate or severe acute illness should not be
vaccinated until the illness has improved. Minor illness (e.g.,
otitis media, mild upper respiratory infections), concurrent
antibiotic therapy, and exposure or recovery from other
illnesses are not contraindications to rubella vaccination.
Receipt of antibody-containing blood products (e.g.,
immune globulin, whole blood or packed red blood
cells, intravenous immune globulin) may interfere with
seroconversion to rubella vaccine. Vaccine should be given
2 weeks before, or deferred for at least 3 months following
administration of an antibody-containing blood product. If
rubella vaccine is given as combined MMR, a longer delay
may be necessary before vaccination. For more information,
see Chapter 2, General Recommendations on Immunization.
Previous administration of human anti-Rho(D) immune
globulin (Rhogam) does not generally interfere with an
immune response to rubella vaccine and is not a contra-
indication to postpartum vaccination. However, women
who have received anti-Rho immune globulin should be
serologically tested 6-8 weeks after vaccination to ensure
that seroconversion has occurred.
19
A personal or family (i.e., sibling or parent) history of
seizures of any etiology is a precaution for MMRV vaccina-
tion. Studies suggest that children who have a personal or
family history of febrile seizures or family history of epilepsy
are at increased risk for febrile seizures compared with
children without such histories. Children with a personal or
family history of seizures of any etiology generally should be
vaccinated with MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine because
the risks for using MMRV vaccine in this group of children
generally outweigh the benefits.
Although vaccine virus may be isolated from the pharynx,
vaccinees do not transmit rubella to others, except occasion-
ally in the case of the vaccinated breastfeeding woman.
In this situation, the infant may be infected, presumably
through breast milk, and may develop a mild rash illness,
but serious effects have not been reported. Infants infected
through breastfeeding have been shown to respond normally
to rubella vaccination at 12–15 months of age. Breastfeeding
is not a contraindication to rubella vaccination and does not
alter rubella vaccination recommendations.

MMR Adverse Reactions
Adverse Reactions Following
Vaccination
Rubella vaccine is very safe. Most adverse reactions
reported following MMR vaccination (such as fever and
rash) are attributable to the measles component. The most
common complaints following rubella vaccination are fever,
lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia. These adverse reactions
only occur in susceptible persons and are more common in
adults, especially in women.

• Acute arthritis-like signs and symptoms
occurs in about 10% of recipients
Rare reports of chronic or persistent
symptoms
Population-based studies have not
confirmed an association with rubella
vaccine
Joint symptoms, such as arthralgia (joint pain) and arthritis
(joint redness and/or swelling), are associated with the
rubella component of MMR. Arthralgia and transient
arthritis occur more frequently in susceptible adults than
in children and more frequently in susceptible women
than in men. Acute arthralgia or arthritis is rare following
vaccination of children with RA 27/3 vaccine. By contrast,
approximately 25% of susceptible postpubertal females
develop acute arthralgia following RA 27/3 vaccination,
and approximately 10% have been reported to have acute
arthritis-like signs and symptoms. Rarely, transient periph-
eral neuritic complaints, such as paresthesias and pain in
the arms and legs, have been reported.
.
When acute joint symptoms occur, or when pain or
paresthesias not associated with joints occur, the symptoms
generally begin 1-3 weeks after vaccination, persist for 1
day to 3 weeks, and rarely recur. Adults with acute joint
symptoms following rubella vaccination rarely have had to
disrupt work activities.
119
Data from studies in the United States and experience from
other countries using the RA 27/3 strain rubella vaccine
have not supported an association between the vaccine
and chronic arthritis. One study among 958 seronegative
immunized and 932 seronegative unimmunized women
aged 15–39 years found no association between rubella
vaccination and development of recurrent joint symptoms,
neuropathy, or collagen disease.
The ACIP continues to recommend the vaccination of
all adult women who do not have evidence of rubella
immunity.
See the Measles and Varicella chapters for information
about adverse reactions following MMRV vaccine.
Rubella Vaccination of Women of
Childbearing Age
Women who are pregnant or who intend to become
pregnant within 4 weeks should not receive rubella vaccine.

pregnant should not be vaccinated. All other women should
be vaccinated after being informed of the theoretical risks
of vaccination during pregnancy and the importance of not
becoming pregnant during the 4 weeks following vaccina-
tion. ACIP does not recommend routine pregnancy screening
of women before rubella vaccination.

from the known teratogenicity of the wild-virus strain. To
determine whether CRS would occur in infants of such
mothers. CDC maintained a registry from 1971 to 1989 of

susceptible vaccinees, regardless of the vaccine strain,
the data collected by CDC in the VIP Registry showed no
evidence of CRS occurring in offspring of the 321 susceptible
women who received rubella vaccine and who continued
pregnancy to term. The observed risk of vaccine-induced
malformation was 0%, with a maximum theoretical risk of
1.6%, based on 95% confidence limits (1.2% for all types
of rubella vaccine). Since the risk of the vaccine to the
fetus appears to be extremely low, if it exists at all, routine
termination of pregnancy is not recommended. Individual
counseling for these women is recommended. As of April 30,
1989, CDC discontinued the VIP registry.
The ACIP continues to state that because of the small theo-
retical risk to the fetus of a vaccinated woman, pregnant
women should not be vaccinated.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
MMR vaccine can be stored either in the freezer or the
refrigerator and should be protected from light at all times.
MMRV vaccine should be stored frozen between -58°F
and +5°F (-50°C to -15°C). When MMR vaccine is stored in
the freezer, the temperature should be the same as that
required for MMRV, between -58°F and +5°F (-50°C to -15°C).
Storing MMR in the freezer with MMRV may help prevent
inadvertent storage of MMRV in the refrigerator.

Rubella
Diluent may be stored at refrigerator temperature or at
room temperature. After reconstitution, MMR vaccines must
be stored at refrigerator temperature and protected from
light. Reconstituted vaccine should be used immediately. If
reconstituted vaccine is not used within 8 hours, it must be
discarded. MMRV must be administered within 30 minutes
of reconstitution.
Strategies to Decrease Rubella
and CRS
Vaccination of Susceptible Postpubertal
Females
Elimination of indigenous rubella and CRS can be main-
tained by continuing efforts to vaccinate susceptible adoles-
cents and young adults of childbearing age, particularly
those born outside the United States. These efforts should
include vaccinating in family planning clinics, sexually trans-
mitted disease (STD) clinics, and as part of routine gyneco-
logic care; maximizing use of premarital serology results;
emphasizing immunization for college students; vaccinating
women postpartum and postabortion; immunizing prison
staff and, when possible, prison inmates, especially women
inmates; offering vaccination to at-risk women through
the special supplemental program for Women, Infants and
Children (WIC); and implementing vaccination programs in
the workplace, particularly those employing persons born
outside the United States.
19
Hospital Rubella Programs
Emphasis should be placed on vaccinating susceptible
hospital personnel, both male and female (e.g., volunteers,
trainees, nurses, physicians.) Ideally, all hospital employees
should be immune. It is important to note that screening
programs alone are not adequate. Vaccination of susceptible
staff must follow.

Tetanus

Tetanus
Tetanus
Tetanus is an acute, often fatal, disease caused by an
exotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. It is
characterized by generalized rigidity and convulsive spasms
of skeletal muscles. The muscle stiffness usually involves the
jaw (lockjaw) and neck and then becomes generalized.
• First described by Hippocrates
Etiology discovered in 1884 by
Carle and Rattone
• Passive immunization used for
treatment and prophylaxis
during World War I
• Tetanus toxoid first widely used
during World War II
Although records from antiquity (5th century BCE) contain
clinical descriptions of tetanus, it was Carle and Rattone
in 1884 who first produced tetanus in animals by injecting
them with pus from a fatal human tetanus case. During
the same year, Nicolaier produced tetanus in animals
by injecting them with samples of soil. In 1889, Kitasato
isolated the organism from a human victim, showed that it
produced disease when injected into animals, and reported
that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies. In
1897, Nocard demonstrated the protective effect of passively
transferred antitoxin, and passive immunization in humans
was used for treatment and prophylaxis during World War I.
A method for inactivating tetanus toxin with formaldehyde
was developed by Ramon in the early 1920's which led to
the development of tetanus toxoid by Descombey in 1924. It
was first widely used during World War II.
Clostridium tetani
Clostridium tetani
C. tetani is a slender, gram-positive, anaerobic rod that may
develop a terminal spore, giving it a drumstick appearance.
The organism is sensitive to heat and cannot survive in
the presence of oxygen. The spores, in contrast, are very
resistant to heat and the usual antiseptics. They can survive
autoclaving at 249.8°F (121°C) for 10–15 minutes. The spores
are also relatively resistant to phenol and other chemical
agents.
• Anaerobic gram-positive, spore-
forming bacteria
• Spores found in soil, animal
feces; may persist for months to
years
• Multiple toxins produced with
growth of bacteria
• Tetanospasmin estimated
human lethal dose = 2.5 ng/kg
20.
I
The spores are widely distributed in soil and in the intes-
tines and feces of horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats,
guinea pigs, and chickens. Manure-treated soil may contain
large numbers of spores. In agricultural areas, a significant
number of human adults may harbor the organism. The
spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contami-
nated heroin.
1
C. tetani produces two exotoxins, tetanolysin and tetano-
spasmin. The function of tetanolysin is not known with
certainty. Tetanospasmin is a neurotoxin and causes the
clinical manifestations of tetanus. On the basis of weight,
tetanospasmin is one of the most potent toxins known. The
estimated minimum human lethal dose is 2.5 nanograms
per kilogram of body weight (a nanogram is one billionth of
a gram), or 175 nanograms for a 70-kg (1541b) human.

Tetanus
Tetanus Pathogenesis
• Anaerobic conditions allow
germination of spores and
production of toxins
• Toxin binds in central nervous
system
• Interferes with neurotransmitter
release to block inhibitor impulses
• Leads to unopposed muscle
contraction and spasm
Pathogenesis
C. tetani usually enters the body through a wound. In the
presence of anaerobic (low oxygen) conditions, the spores
germinate. Toxins are produced and disseminated via blood
and lymphatics. Toxins act at several sites within the central
nervous system, including peripheral motor end plates,
spinal cord, and brain, and in the sympathetic nervous
system. The typical clinical manifestations of tetanus
are caused when tetanus toxin interferes with release of
neurotransmitters, blocking inhibitor impulses. This leads
to unopposed muscle contraction and spasm. Seizures may
occur, and the autonomic nervous system may also be
affected.
Tetanus Clinical Features
• Incubation period; 8 days
(range, 3-21 days)
• Three clinical forms: local (not common),
cephalic (rare), generalized (most
common)
• Generalized tetanus: descending
symptoms of trismus (lockjaw), difficulty
swallowing, muscle rigidity, spasms
• Spasms continue for 3-4 weeks;
complete recovery may take months
Clinical Features
The incubation period ranges from 3 to 21 days, usually
about 8 days. In general the further the injury site is from
the central nervous system, the longer the incubation
period. The shorter the incubation period, the higher the
chance of death. In neonatal tetanus, symptoms usually
appear from 4 to 14 days after birth, averaging about 7 days.
On the basis of clinical findings, three different forms of
tetanus have been described.
Local tetanus is an uncommon form of the disease, in which
patients have persistent contraction of muscles in the same
anatomic area as the injury. These contractions may persist
for many weeks before gradually subsiding. Local tetanus
may precede the onset of generalized tetanus but is gener-
ally milder. Only about 1% of cases are fatal.
20
Cephalic tetanus is a rare form of the disease, occasionally
occurring with otitis media (ear infections) in which C. tetani
is present in the flora of the middle ear, or following injuries
to the head. There is involvement of the cranial nerves,
especially in the facial area.
The most common type (about 80%) of reported tetanus
is generalized tetanus. The disease usually presents with
a descending pattern. The first sign is trismus or lockjaw,
followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing,
and rigidity of abdominal muscles. Other symptoms include
elevated temperature, sweating, elevated blood pressure,
and episodic rapid heart rate. Spasms may occur frequently
and last for several minutes. Spasms continue for 3-4 weeks.
Complete recovery may take months.
Neonatal Tetanus
• Generalized tetanus in newborn
infant
• Infant born without protective
passive immunity
• Estimated more than 257,000
deaths worldwide in 2000-2003
Neonatal tetanus is a form of generalized tetanus that
occurs in newborn infants. Neonatal tetanus occurs in
infants born without protective passive immunity, because
the mother is not immune. It usually occurs through infec-
tion of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the

stump is cut with an unsterile instrument. Neonatal tetanus
is common in some developing countries (estimated more
than 257,000 annual deaths worldwide in 2000-2003), but
very rare in the United States.
Tetanus Complications
Complications
Laryngospasm (spasm of the vocal cords) and/or spasm
of the muscles of respiration leads to interference with
breathing. Fractures of the spine or long bones may result
from sustained contractions and convulsions. Hyperactivity
of the autonomic nervous system may lead to hypertension
and/or an abnormal heart rhythm.
O
Laryngospasm
• Fractures
• Hypertension
• Nosocomial infections
• Pulmonary embolism
• Aspiration pneumonia
• Death
Nosocomial infections are common because of prolonged
hospitalization. Secondary infections may include sepsis
from indwelling catheters, hospital-acquired pneumonias,
and decubitus ulcers. Pulmonary embolism is particularly
a problem in drug users and elderly patients. Aspiration
pneumonia is a common late complication of tetanus, found
in 50%-70% of autopsied cases. In recent years, tetanus
has been fatal in approximately 11% of reported cases.
Cases most likely to be fatal are those occurring in persons
60 years of age and older (18%) and unvaccinated persons
(22%). In about 20% of tetanus deaths, no obvious pathology
is identified and death is attributed to the direct effects of
tetanus toxin.
201
Laboratory Diagnosis
There are no laboratory findings characteristic of tetanus.
The diagnosis is entirely clinical and does not depend upon
bacteriologic confirmation. C. tetani is recovered from
the wound in only 30% of cases and can be isolated from
patients who do not have tetanus. Laboratory identification
of the organism depends most importantly on the demon-
stration of toxin production in mice.
Medical Management
All wounds should be cleaned. Necrotic tissue and foreign
material should be removed. If tetanic spasms are occurring,
supportive therapy and maintenance of an adequate airway
are critical
in
Tetanus immune globulin (TIG) is recommended for persons
with tetanus. TIG can only help remove unbound tetanus
toxin. It cannot affect toxin bound to nerve endings. A single
intramuscular dose of 3,000 to 5,000 units is generally
recommended for children and adults, with part of the
dose infiltrated around the wound if it can be identified.
Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) contains tetanus anti-
toxin and may be used if TIG is not available.

Tetanus
Because of the extreme potency of the toxin, tetanus disease
does not result in tetanus immunity. Active immunization
with tetanus toxoid should begin or continue as soon as the
person's condition has stabilized.

Vaccination History
Wound Management
Antibiotic prophylaxis against tetanus is neither practical
nor useful in managing wounds; proper immunization plays
the more important role. The need for active immunization,
with or without passive immunization, depends on the
condition of the wound and the patient's immunization
history (see MMWR 2006;55[RR-17] for details). Rarely have
cases of tetanus occurred in persons with a documented
primary series of tetanus toxoid.

Persons with wounds that are neither clean nor minor, and
who have had 0–2 prior doses of tetanus toxoid or have an
uncertain history of prior doses should receive TIG as well
as Td or Tdap. This is because early doses of toxoid may
not induce immunity, but only prime the immune system.
The TIG provides temporary immunity by directly providing
antitoxin. This ensures that protective levels of antitoxin are
achieved even if an immune response has not yet occurred.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Tetanus occurs worldwide but is most frequently encoun-
tered in densely populated regions in hot, damp climates
with soil rich in organic matter.

Organisms are found primarily in the soil and intestinal
tracts of animals and humans.

Mode of Transmission
Transmission is primarily by contaminated wounds (apparent
and inapparent). The wound may be major or minor. In
recent years, however, a higher proportion of patients had
minor wounds, probably because severe wounds are more
likely to be properly managed. Tetanus may follow elective
surgery, burns, deep puncture wounds, crush wounds,
otitis media (ear infections), dental infection, animal bites,
abortion, and pregnancy.

Secular Trends in the United States
A marked decrease in mortality from tetanus occurred from
the early 1900s to the late 1940s. In the late 1940s, tetanus
toxoid was introduced into routine childhood immunization
and tetanus became nationally notifiable. At that time,
500-600 cases (approximately 0.4 cases per 100,000 population)
were reported per year.

2007 an average of 31 cases were reported per year. The
death-to-case ratio has declined from 30% to approximately
10% in recent years. An all-time low of 18 cases (0.01 cases

From 1980 through 2000, 70% of reported cases of tetanus
were among persons 40 years of age or older. From 1980
through 1990, a median of 21% of reported cases were
among persons younger than 40 years of age. The age
distribution of reported cases shifted to a younger age group
in the last half of the 1990s. Persons younger than 40 years
accounted for 28% of cases during 1991–1995, increasing
to 42% of cases during 1996–2000. This change in age
distribution is a result of both an increase in cases in persons
younger than 40 years and a decrease in cases in older people.
The increase in cases among younger persons is related
in part to an increased number of cases among young
injection-drug users in California in the late 1990s.

Tetanus toxoid consists of a formaldehyde-treated toxin.
The toxoid is standardized for potency in animal tests
according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regula-
tions. Occasionally, potency is mistakenly equated with Lf

potency in inducing protection.

Tetanus toxoid is available as a single-antigen preparation,
combined with diphtheria toxoid as pediatric diphtheria-
tetanus toxoid (DT) or adult tetanus-diphtheria (Td), and with
both diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis vaccine as
DTaP or Tdap. Tetanus toxoid is also available as combined
DTP-HepB-IPV (Pediarix) and DTAP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel-see
Chapter 15 for more information). Pediatric formulations
(DT and DTP) contain a similar amount of tetanus toxoid as
adult Td, but contain 3 to 4 times as much diphtheria toxoid.
Children younger than 7 years of age should receive either
DTP or pediatric DT. Persons 7 years of age or older should
receive the adult formulation (adult Td), even if they have
not completed a series of DTP or pediatric DT. The use of
single-antigen tetanus toxoid is not recommended. Tetanus

toxoid should be given in combination with diphtheria
toxoid, since periodic boosting is needed for both antigens.
Two brands of Tdap are available: Boostrix (approved for
persons 10 through 64 years of age) and Adacel (approved for
persons 11 through 64 years of age). DTP and Tdap vaccines
do not contain thimerosal as a preservative.
Immunogenicity and Vaccine Efficacy
After a primary series (three properly spaced doses of
tetanus toxoid in persons 7 years of age and older, and four
doses in children younger than 7 years of age) essentially all
recipients achieve antitoxin levels considerably greater than
the protective level of 0.1 IU/mL.
Efficacy of the toxoid has never been studied in a vaccine
trial. It can be inferred from protective antitoxin levels that
a complete tetanus toxoid series has a clinical efficacy of
virtually 100%; cases of tetanus occurring in fully immu-
nized persons whose last dose was within the last 10 years
are extremely rare.
Antitoxin levels decrease with time. While some persons
may be protected for life, by 10 years after the last dose,
most persons have antitoxin levels that only approach the
minimal protective level. As a result, routine boosters are
recommended every 10 years.
In a small percentage of individuals, antitoxin levels fall
below the minimal protective level before 10 years have
elapsed. To ensure adequate protective antitoxin levels,
persons who sustain a wound that is other than clean and
minor should receive a tetanus booster if more than years
have elapsed since their last dose. (See Wound Management
for details on persons who previously received fewer than
three doses).

DTP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular

weeks through 6 years of age. The usual schedule is a
primary series of four doses at 2, 4, 6, and 15–18 months
of age. The first, second, and third doses of DTP should
be separated by a minimum of 4 weeks. The fourth dose
should follow the third dose by no less than 6 months and
should not be administered before 12 months of age.

child should receive a total of four primary DT doses. If

the first dose of DT was administered, three doses (third
dose 6–12 months after the second) completes the primary
DT series.
If the fourth dose of DTP, DTP, or DT is administered before
the fourth birthday, a booster dose is recommended at 4-6
years of age. The fifth dose is not required if the fourth dose
was given on or after the fourth birthday.
Tetanus, Diphtheria and Pertussis
Booster Doses
Because of waning antitoxin titers, most persons have
antitoxin levels below the optimal level 10 years after the
last dose of DTP, DTP, DT, or Td. Additional booster doses of
tetanus and diphtheria toxoids are required every 10 years
to maintain protective antitoxin titers. The first booster dose
of Td may be given at 11 or 12 years of age if at least 5 years
have elapsed since the last dose of DTP, DTP, or DT. The
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recom-
mends that this dose be administered as Tdap. If a dose is
given sooner as part of wound management, the next booster
is not needed for 10 years thereafter. More frequent boosters
are not indicated and have been reported to result in an
increased incidence and severity of local adverse reactions.

Td is the vaccine of choice for children 7 years and older and
for adults. A primary series is three or four doses, depending
on whether the person has received prior doses of diphtheria-
containing vaccine and the age these doses were adminis-
tered. The number of doses recommended for children who
received one or more doses of DTP, DTP, or DT before age
7 years is discussed above. For unvaccinated persons 7 years
and older (including persons who cannot document prior
vaccination), the primary series is three doses. The first two
doses should be separated by at least 4 weeks, and the third
dose given 6 to 12 months after the second. ACIP recommends
that one of these doses (preferably the first) be administered
as Tdap. A booster dose of Td should be given every 10 years.
Tdap is approved for a single dose at this time (i.e., it should
not be used for all the doses of Td in a previously unvac-
cinated person 7 years or older). Refer to the Pertussis chapter
for more information about Tdap.
*ACIP recommends that one of these doses
(preferably the first) be administered as Tdap
Interruption of the recommended schedule or delay of
subsequent doses does not reduce the response to the vaccine
when the series is finally completed. There is no need to
restart a series regardless of the time elapsed between doses.
Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids
Contraindications and Precautions
Tetanus disease does not confer immunity because of the very
small amount of toxin required to produce illness. Persons
recovering from tetanus should begin or complete active
immunization with tetanus toxoid (Td) during convalescence.

Exaggerated local (Arthus-like) reactions are occasionally

painful swelling, often from shoulder to elbow. They gener-
ally begin from 2 to 8 hours after injections and are reported
most often in adults, particularly those who have received
frequent doses of diphtheria or tetanus toxoid. Persons expe-
riencing these severe reactions usually have very high serum
antitoxin levels; they should not be given further routine or
emergency booster doses of Td more frequently than every

Varicella
Varicella is an acute infectious disease caused by varicella
zoster virus (VZV). The recurrent infection (herpes zoster,
also known as shingles) has been recognized since ancient
times. Primary varicella infection (chickenpox) was not
reliably distinguished from smallpox until the end of the
19th century. In 1875, Steiner demonstrated that chick-
enpox was caused by an infectious agent by inoculating
volunteers with the vesicular fluid from a patient with
acute varicella. Clinical observations of the relationship
between varicella and herpes zoster were made in 1888
by von Bokay, when children without evidence of varicella
immunity acquired varicella after contact with herpes
zoster. VZV was isolated from vesicular fluid of both chick-
enpox and zoster lesions in cell culture by Thomas Weller
in 1954. Subsequent laboratory studies of the virus led to
the development of a live attenuated varicella vaccine in
Japan in the 1970s. The vaccine was licensed for use in the
United States in March 1995. The first vaccine to reduce
the risk of herpes zoster was licensed in May 2006.

Varicella Zoster Virus
VZV is a DNA virus and is a member of the herpesvirus
group. Like other herpesviruses, VZV has the capacity to
persist in the body after the primary (first) infection as
a latent infection. VZV persists in sensory nerve ganglia.
Primary infection with VZV results in chickenpox. Herpes
zoster (shingles) is the result of recurrent infection. The
virus is believed to have a short survival time in the
environment.

Pathogenesis
VZV enters through the respiratory tract and conjunctiva.
The virus is believed to replicate at the site of entry in
the nasopharynx and in regional lymph nodes. A primary
viremia occurs 4 to 6 days after infection and disseminates
the virus to other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and
sensory ganglia. Further replication occurs in the viscera,
followed by a secondary viremia, with viral infection of the
skin. Virus can be cultured from mononuclear cells of an
infected person from 5 days before to 1 or 2 days after the
appearance of the rash.

Varicella Clinical Features
Clinical Features
The incubation period is 14 to 16 days after exposure, with
a range of 10 to 21 days. The incubation period may be
prolonged in immunocompromised patients and those
who have received postexposure treatment with a varicella
antibody-containing product.
• Incubation period 14-16 days (range
10-21 days)
• Mild prodrome for 1-2 days

## p. 302 (#316) ############################################

Varicella
Primary Infection (Chickenpox]
A mild prodrome may precede the onset of a rash. Adults
may have 1 to 2 days of fever and malaise prior to rash onset,
but in children the rash is often the first sign of disease.
The rash is generalized and pruritic and progresses rapidly
from macules to papules to vesicular lesions before crusting.
The rash usually appears first on the head, then on the
trunk, and then the extremities; the highest concentration of
lesions is on the trunk (centripetal distribution). Lesions also
can occur on mucous membranes of the oropharynx, respi-
ratory tract, vagina, conjunctiva, and the cornea. Lesions are
usually 1 to 4 mm in diameter. The vesicles are superficial
and delicate and contain clear fluid on an erythematous
base. Vesicles may rupture or become purulent before they
dry and crust. Successive crops appear over several days,
with lesions present in several stages of development. For
example, macular lesions may be observed in the same area
of skin as mature vesicles. Healthy children usually have 200
to 500 lesions in 2 to 4 successive crops.
The clinical course in healthy children is generally mild,
with malaise, pruritus (itching), and temperature up to
102°F for 2 to 3 days. Adults may have more severe disease
and have a higher incidence of complications. Respiratory
and gastrointestinal symptoms are absent. Children with
lymphoma and leukemia may develop a severe progressive
form of varicella characterized by high fever, extensive
vesicular eruption, and high complication rates. Children
infected with human immunodeficiency virus also may have
severe, prolonged illness.
21
Recovery from primary varicella infection usually results in
lifetime immunity. In otherwise healthy persons, a second
occurrence of chickenpox is not common, but it can happen,
particularly in immunocompromised persons. As with other
viral diseases, reexposure to natural (wild) varicella may lead
to reinfection that boosts antibody titers without causing
clinical illness or detectable viremia.

Recurrent Disease CHerpes Zoster)
Herpes zoster, or shingles, occurs when latent VZV reac-
tivates and causes recurrent disease. The immunologic
mechanism that controls latency of VZV is not well under-
stood. However, factors associated with recurrent disease
include aging, immunosuppression, intrauterine exposure to
VZV, and having had varicella at a young age (younger than
18 months). In immunocompromised persons, zoster may
disseminate, causing generalized skin lesions and central
nervous system, pulmonary, and hepatic involvement.
The vesicular eruption of zoster generally occurs unilater-
ally in the distribution of a sensory nerve. Most often,

Varicella
Acute varicella is generally mild and self-limited, but it may
be associated with complications. Secondary bacterial infec-
tions of skin lesions with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus are
the most common cause of hospitalization and outpatient
medical visits. Secondary infection with invasive group A
streptococci may cause serious illness and lead to hospital-
ization or death. Pneumonia following varicella is usually
viral but may be bacterial. Secondary bacterial pneumonia
is more common in children younger than 1 year of age.
Central nervous system manifestations of varicella range
from aseptic meningitis to encephalitis. Involvement of the
cerebellum, with resulting cerebellar ataxia, is the most
common and generally has a good outcome. Encephalitis is
an infrequent complication of varicella (estimated 1.8 per
10,000 cases) and may lead to seizures and coma. Diffuse
cerebral involvement is more common in adults than in
children. Reye syndrome is an unusual complication of vari-
cella and influenza and occurs almost exclusively in children
who take aspirin during the acute illness. The etiology
of
Reye syndrome is unknown. There has been a dramatic
decrease in the incidence of Reye syndrome during the past
decade, presumably related to decreased use of aspirin by
children.

rates were approximately 2-3 per 1,000 cases among
healthy children and 8 per 1,000 cases among adults. Death
occurred in approximately 1 in 60,000 cases. From 1990
through 1996, an average of 103 deaths from varicella were
reported each year. Most deaths occur in immunocompetent
children and adults. Since 1996, the number of hospitaliza-
tions and deaths from varicella has declined more than 90%.

cella is approximately 1 per 100,000 cases, among persons
15–19 years, it is 2.7 per 100,000 cases, and among adults
30–49 years of age, 25.2 per 100,000 cases. Adults account
for only 5% of reported cases of varicella but approximately
35% of mortality.
Immunocompromised persons have a high risk of dissemi-
nated disease (up to 36% in one report). These persons may
have multiple organ system involvement, and the disease
may become fulminant and hemorrhagic. The most frequent
complications in immunocompromised persons are pneu-
monia and encephalitis. Children with HIV infection are at
increased risk for morbidity from varicella and herpes zoster.
The onset of maternal varicella from 5 days before to 2
days after delivery may result in overwhelming infection of
the neonate and a fatality rate as high as 30%. This severe
disease is believed to result from fetal exposure to varicella
virus without the benefit of passive maternal antibody.
Infants born to mothers with onset of maternal varicella 5
days or more prior to delivery usually have a benign course,
presumably due to passive transfer of maternal antibody
across the placenta.
Herpes Zoster
Postherpetic neuralgia, or pain in the area of the ocurrence
that persists after the lesions have resolved, is a distressing
complication of zoster. There is currently no adequate
therapy available. Postherpetic neuralgia may last a year or
longer after the episode of zoster. Ocular nerve and other
organ involvement with zoster can occur, often with severe
sequelae.

Congenital Varicella Syndrome
• Results from maternal infection
during pregnancy
• Low birth weight, atrophy of extremity
with skin scarring, eye and neurologic
abnormalities
• Risk appears to be low (less than 2%)
• Period of risk may extend through
first 20 weeks of pregnancy
Congenital VZV Infection
Primary maternal varicella infection in the first 20 weeks
of gestation is occasionally associated with a variety of
abnormalities in the newborn, including low birth weight,
hypoplasia of an extremity, skin scarring, localized muscular
atrophy, encephalitis, cortical atrophy, chorioretinitis,
and microcephaly. This constellation of abnormalities,
collectively known as congenital varicella syndrome, was
first recognized in 1947. The risk of congenital abnormalities
from primary maternal varicella infection appears to be very
low (less than 2%). Rare reports of congenital birth defects
following maternal zoster exist, but virologic confirmation of
maternal lesions is lacking.

Specimens are best collected by unroofing a vesicle, prefer-
ably a fresh fluid-filled vesicle, and then rubbing the base of
a skin lesion with a polyester swab. Crusts from lesions are
also excellent specimens for PCR. Other specimen sources
such as nasopharyngeal secretions, saliva, blood, urine,
bronchial washings, and cerebrospinal fluid are considered
less desirable sources than skin lesions because positive test
results from such specimens are much less likely. Because
viral proteins persist after cessation of viral replication, PCR
and DFA may be positive when viral cultures are negative.

A reliable history of chickenpox has been found to be a valid
measure of immunity to varicella because the rash is distinc-
tive and subclinical cases are unusual. As a result, serologic
testing of children is generally not necessary. However, se
logic testing may be useful in adult vaccination programs. A
variety of serologic tests for varicella antibody are available
commercially including a latex agglutination assay (LA) and
a number of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

sensitive to reliably detect seroconversion to vaccine, but
are robust enough to screen persons for VZV susceptibility.

is sensitive, simple, and rapid to perform. LA is somewhat
more sensitive than commercial ELISAs, although it can
result in false-positive results, leading to failure to identify
persons without evidence of varicella immunity. This latter
concern can be minimized by performing LA as a dilution
series. Either of these tests would be useful for screening for
varicella immunity.
Antibody resulting from vaccination is generally of lower
titer than antibody resulting from varicella disease.
Commercial antibody assays, particularly the LA test, may
not be sensitive enough to detect vaccine-induced antibody
in some recipients. Because of the potential for false-
negative serologic tests, routine postvaccination serologic
testing is not recommended. For diagnosis of acute varicella
infection, serologic confirmation would include a significant
rise in varicella IgG by any standard serologic assay. Testing
using commercial kits for IgM antibody is not recommended
since available methods lack sensitivity and specificity; false-
positive IgM results are common in the presence of high IgG
levels. The National VZV Laboratory at CDC has developed a
reliable IgM capture assay. Call 404-639-0066, 404-639-3667,

Varicella
In the prevaccine era, varicella was endemic in the United
States, and virtually all persons acquired varicella by
adulthood. As a result, the number of cases occurring
annually was estimated to approximate the birth cohort,
or approximately 4 million per year. Varicella was removed
from the list of nationally notifiable conditions in 1981, but
some states continued to report cases to CDC. The majority
of cases (approximately 85%) occurred among children
younger than 15 years of age. The highest age-specific
incidence of varicella was among children 1-4 years of age,
who accounted for 39% of all cases. This age distribution
was probably a result of earlier exposure to VZV in preschool
and child care settings. Children 5–9 years of age accounted
for 38% of cases. Adults 20 years of age and older accounted
for only 7% of cases (National Health Interview Survey data,
1990–1994).

Varicella
these groups. The reduction of varicella cases is the result
of the increasing use of varicella vaccine. Varicella vaccine
coverage among 19–35-month-old children was estimated
by the National Immunization Survey to be 90% in 2007.
Despite high one-dose vaccination coverage and success of
the vaccination program in reducing varicella morbidity and
mortality, varicella surveillance indicates that the number
of reported varicella cases appears to have plateaued. An
increasing proportion of cases represent breakthrough
infection (chickenpox occurring in a previously vaccinated
person). In 2001–2005, outbreaks were reported in schools
with high varicella vaccination coverage (96%-100%). These
outbreaks had many similarities: all occurred in elementary
schools; vaccine effectiveness was within the expected range
(72%-85%); the highest attack rates occurred among the
younger students; each outbreak lasted about 2 months; and
persons with breakthrough infection transmitted the virus
although the breakthrough disease was mild. Overall attack
rates among vaccinated children were 11%-17%, with attack
rates in some classrooms as high as 40%. These data indicate
that even in settings where almost everyone was vaccinated
and vaccine performed as expected, varicella outbreaks
could not be prevented with the current one-dose vaccina-
tion policy. These observations led to the recommendation in
2006 for a second routine dose of varicella vaccine.
Herpes Zoster
Herpes Zoster
Herpes zoster is not a notifiable condition. An estimated
500,000 to 1 million episodes of zoster occur annually in the
United States. The lifetime risk of zoster is estimated to be
at least 32%. Increasing age and cellular immunosuppression
are the most important risk factors; 50% of persons living
until age 85 years will develop zoster.

Vaccines Containing Varicella Virus
Three varicella-containing vaccines are now approved for
use in the United States: varicella vaccine (Varivax), combi-
nation measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine
(ProQuad), and herpes zoster vaccine (Zostavax).

Varicella Vaccine
Varicella vaccine (Varivax, Merck) is a live attenuated viral
vaccine, derived from the Oka strain of VZV. The vaccine
virus was isolated by Takahashi in the early 1970s from
vesicular fluid from an otherwise healthy child with varicella
disease. Varicella vaccine was licensed for general use in
Japan and Korea in 1988. It was licensed in the United States
in 1995 for persons 12 months of age and older. The virus

was attenuated by sequential passage in human embryonic
lung cell culture, embryonic guinea pig fibroblasts, and
in WI-38 human diploid cells. The Oka/Merck vaccine has
undergone further passage through MRC-5 human diploid
cell cultures for a total of 31 passages. The reconstituted
vaccine contains small amounts of sucrose, processed
porcine gelatin, sodium chloride, monosodium L-glutamate,
sodium diphosphate, potassium phosphate, and potassium
chloride, and trace quantities of residual components of
MRC-5 cells (DNA and protein), EDTA, neomycin, and fetal
bovine serum. The vaccine is reconstituted with sterile water
and contains no preservative.
Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella Vaccine
In September 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
licensed a combined live attenuated measles-mumps-rubella
and varicella vaccine (ProQuad, Merck) for use in persons 12
months through 12 years of age. The attenuated measles,
mumps, and rubella vaccine viruses in MMRV are identical
and of equal titer to those in the measles-mumps-rubella
(MMR) vaccine. The titer of Oka/Merck varicella zoster virus
is higher in MMRV vaccine than in single-antigen varicella
vaccine, a minimum of 9,772 (3.99 log10) plaque-forming units
(PFU) versus 1,350 PFU (~3.13 logro), respectively. Each 0.5-ml
dose contains a small quantity of sucrose, hydrolyzed gelatin,
sodium chloride, sorbitol, monosodium L-glutamate, sodium
phosphate dibasic, human albumin, sodium bicarbonate,
potassium phosphate monobasic, potassium chloride; potas-
sium phosphate dibasic; residual components of MRC-5 cells
(DNA and protein) neomycin, bovine calf serum, and other
buffer and media ingredients. The vaccine is reconstituted
with sterile water and contains no preservative.
21
Herpes Zoster Vaccine
In May 2006, the FDA approved herpes zoster vaccine
(Zostavax, Merck) for use in persons 60 years of age and
older. The vaccine contains the same Oka/Merck varicella
zoster virus used in varicella and MMRV vaccines but at a
much higher titer (a minimum of 19,400 PFU versus 1,350
PFU in varicella vaccine). Each 0.65-ml dose contains a small
amount of sucrose, hydrolyzed porcine gelatin, sodium
chloride, monosodium L-glutamate, sodium phosphate
dibasic, potassium phosphate monobasic, potassium
chloride; residual components of MRC-5 cells including (DNA
and protein); neomycin and bovine calf serum. The vaccine is
reconstituted with sterile water and contains no preservative.

children 12 months to 12 years of age develop detectable
antibody titers. More than 90% of vaccine responders
maintain antibody for at least 6 years. In Japanese studies,
97% of children had antibody 7 to 10 years after vaccination.
Vaccine efficacy is estimated to be 70% to 90% against infec-
tion, and 90% to 100% against moderate or severe disease.
Among healthy adolescents and adults 13 years of age and
older, an average of 78% develop antibody after one dose,
and 99% develop antibody after a second dose given 4 to 8
weeks later. Antibody persisted for at least 1 year in 97% of
vaccinees after the second dose given 4 to 8 weeks after the
first dose.
Immunity appears to be long-lasting, and is probably perma-
nent in the majority of vaccinees. Breakthrough infection is
significantly milder, with fewer lesions (generally fewer than
50), many of which are maculopapular rather than vesicular.
Most persons with breakthrough infection do not have fever.
Varicella Breakthrough Infection
Immunity appears to be long-lasting
for most recipients
• Breakthrough disease much milder
than in unvaccinated persons
• No consistent evidence that risk of
breakthrough infection increases with
time since vaccination
Although findings of some studies have suggested otherwise,
most investigations have not identified time since vaccina-
tion as a risk factor for breakthrough varicella. Some, but
not all, recent investigations have identified the presence
of asthma, use of steroids, and vaccination at younger than
15 months of age as risk factors for breakthrough varicella.
Breakthrough varicella infection could be a result of several
factors, including interference of vaccine virus replication by
circulating antibody, impotent vaccine resulting from storage
or handling errors, or inaccurate recordkeeping.
21
Varicella Breakthrough Infection
• Retrospective cohort study of 115,000
children vaccinated in 2 HMOs (January
1995 through December 1999)
• Risk of breakthrough varicella 2.5 times
higher if varicella vaccine administered less
than 30 days following MMR
• No increased risk if varicella vaccine given
simultaneously or more than
30 days after NMR
Interference from live viral vaccine administered before vari-
cella vaccine could also reduce vaccine effectiveness. A study
of 115,000 children in two health maintenance organizations
during 1995–1999 found that children who received varicella
vaccine less than 30 days after MMR vaccination had a
2.5-fold increased risk of breakthrough varicella compared
with those who received varicella vaccine before, simultane-
ously with, or more than 30 days after MMR.
Studies have shown that a second dose of varicella vaccine
boosts immunity and reduces breakthrough disease in
children.
MMWR 2001;50(47): 1058-61
MMRV Vaccine
MMRV vaccine was licensed on the basis of equivalence
of immunogenicity of the antigenic components rather
than the clinical efficacy. Clinical studies involving healthy
children age 12–23 months indicated that those who
received a single dose of MMRV vaccine developed similar
levels of antibody to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella

A second dose of varicella vaccine should be administered
at 4 through 6 years of age, at the same visit as the second
dose of MMR vaccine. The second dose may be administered
earlier than 4 through 6 years of age if at least 3 months
have elapsed following the first dose (i.e., the minimum
interval between doses of varicella vaccine for children
younger than 13 years is 3 months). However, if the second
dose is administered at least 28 days following the first dose,
the second dose does not need to be repeated. A second
dose of varicella vaccine is also recommended for persons
older than 4 through 6 years of age who have received only
one dose. Varicella vaccine doses administered to persons 13
years or older should be separated by 4 to 8 weeks.

separate syringes. If varicella and MMR vaccines are not
administered at the same visit, they should be separated by
at least 28 days. Varicella vaccine may also be administered
simultaneously (but at separate sites with separate syringes)

Varicella
Children with a clinician-diagnosed or verified history of
typical chickenpox can be assumed to be immune to vari-
cella. Serologic testing of such children prior to vaccination
is not warranted because the majority of children between
12 months and 12 years of age without a clinical history of
chickenpox are not immune. Prior history of chickenpox is
not a contraindication to varicella vaccination.
10
Varicella vaccine should be administered to all adolescents
and adults 13 years of age and older who do not have
evidence of varicella immunity (see Varicella Immunity
section). Persons 13 years of age and older should receive
two doses of varicella vaccine separated by at least 4 weeks.
If there is a lapse of more than 4 weeks after the first dose,
the second dose may be administered at any time without
repeating the first dose.

Varicella Vaccine Recommendations
Adolescents and Adults
• All persons 13 years of age and
older without evidence of varicella
immunity
• Two doses separated by at least 4
weeks
. Do not repeat first dose because of
extended interval between doses
Assessment of varicella immunity status of all adolescents
and adults and vaccination of those who lack evidence of
varicella immunity are desirable to protect these individuals
from the higher risk of complications from acquired varicella.
Vaccination may be offered at the time of routine healthcare
visits. However, specific assessment efforts should be focused
on adolescents and adults who are at highest risk of exposure
and those most likely to transmit varicella to others.

Varicella Vaccine Recommendations
Healthcare Personnel
• Recommended for all susceptible
healthcare personnel
• Prevaccination serologic screening
probably cost-effective
• Postvaccination testing not
necessary or recommended
The ACIP recommends that all healthcare personnel be
immune to varicella. In healthcare settings, serologic
screening of personnel who are uncertain of their varicella
history, or who claim not to have had the disease is likely
to be cost-effective. Testing for varicella immunity following
two doses of vaccine is not necessary because 99% of
persons are seropositive after the second dose. Moreover,
available commercial assays are not sensitive enough to
detect antibody following vaccination in all instances.
121
Seroconversion does not always result in full protection
against disease, although no data regarding correlates
of protection are available for adults. If a vaccinated
healthcare provider is exposed to VZV, the employee should
be monitored daily from day 10 to day 21 after exposure
through the employee health or infection control program to
determine clinical status (screen for fever, skin lesions, and
systemic symptoms). Persons with varicella may be infectious
starting 2 days before rash onset. In addition, the healthcare
providershould be instructed to immediately report fever,
headache, or other constitutional symptoms and any skin
lesions (which may be atypical). The person should be placed
on sick leave immediately if symptoms occur.

clearly outweigh this potential risk. Transmission of vaccine
virus appears to occur primarily if and when the vaccinee
develops a vaccine-associated rash. As a safeguard, medical
facilities may wish to consider protocols for personnel who
develop a rash following vaccination (e.g., avoidance of

such as immunosuppressed persons who do not have

not receive MMRV. When used, MMRV vaccine should be
administered on or after the first birthday, preferably as
soon as the child becomes eligible for vaccination. MMRV
may be used for both the first and second doses of MMR
and varicella in children younger than 13 years. The
minimum interval between doses of MMRV is 3 months.

For the first dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella

should discuss the benefits and risks of both vaccination
options with the parents or caregivers. Unless the parent
or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV vaccine, CDC
recommends that MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine should
be administered for the first dose in this age group. For
the second dose of measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella
vaccines at any age (15 months through 12 years) and for

based on a Merck study that showed the average titer against
varicella zoster virus (VZV) was lower in persons who received
zoster and PPSV at the same visit compared to persons who
received these vaccines 4 weeks apart. However, the clinical
relevance of this observation is unknown because there is no
evidence to indicate that antibody titers against VZV are a
measure of protection against zoster. Antibody levels to PPSV
serotypes 3, 14, 19A, 22F were assessed during this study and
were unaffected by simultaneous administration, though
significance of this observation is also unknown. Finally, the
safety profile of zoster is unaffected by simultaneous admin-
istration of PPSV. Consequently, to avoid introducing barriers
to patients and providers who are interested in these two
important vaccines, CDC has not changed its recommenda-
tion for either vaccine, and continues to recommend that
zoster vaccine and PPSV be administered at the same visit if
the person is eligible for both vaccines.

Varicella Vaccine
Data from the United States and Japan in a variety of settings
indicate that varicella vaccine is 70% to 100% effective in
preventing illness or modifying the severity of illness if used
within 3 days, and possibly up to 5 days, after exposure.
ACIP recommends the vaccine for use in persons who do not
have evidence of varicella immunity following exposure to
varicella. If exposure to varicella does not cause infection,
postexposure vaccination should induce protection against
subsequent exposure. If the exposure results in infection,
there is no evidence that administration of varicella vaccine
during the incubation period or prodromal stage of illness
increases the risk for vaccine-associated adverse reactions.
Although postexposure use of varicella vaccine has potential
applications in hospital settings, preexposure vaccination
of all healthcare workers without evidence of varicella
immunity is the recommended and preferred method for
preventing varicella in healthcare settings.

Varicella outbreaks in some settings (e.g., child care facilities

has been used successfully to control these outbreaks. The
ACIP recommends a second dose of varicella vaccine for
outbreak control. During a varicella outbreak, persons who
have received one dose of varicella vaccine should receive a
second dose, provided the appropriate vaccination interval
has elapsed since the first dose (3 months for persons aged
12 months to 12 years and at least 4 weeks for persons aged
13 years of age and older).

Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Varicella-Containing Vaccines
Contraindications and Precautions
Varicella and MMRV Vaccines
Contraindications and precautions are similar for all
varicella-containing vaccines. Persons with a severe allergic
reaction (anaphylaxis) to a vaccine component or following
a prior dose of vaccine should not receive varicella vaccine.
Varicella, MMRV, and zoster vaccines all contain minute
amounts of neomycin and hydrolyzed gelatin but do not
contain egg protein or preservative.
• Severe allergic reaction to vaccine
component or following a prior dose
• Immunosuppression
Pregnancy
• Moderate or severe acute illness
• Recent blood product (except herpes
zoster vaccine)
• Personal or family (i.e., sibling or parent)
history of seizures of any etiology (MMRV
only)
.
Persons with immunosuppression due to leukemia,
lymphoma, generalized malignancy, immune deficiency
disease, or immunosuppressive therapy should not be vacci-
nated with a varicella-containing vaccine. However, treatment
with low-dose (less than 2 mg/kg/day), alternate-day, topical,
replacement, or aerosolized steroid preparations is not a
contraindication to vaccination. Persons whose immunosup-
pressive therapy with steroids has been discontinued for 1
month (3 months for chemotherapy) may be vaccinated.
Single-antigen varicella vaccine may be administered to
persons with impaired humoral immunity (e.g., hypogam-
maglobulinemia). However, the blood products used to
treat humoral immunodeficiency may interfere with the
response to vaccination. Recommended spacing between
administration of the blood product and receipt of vari-
cella vaccine should be observed (see Chapter 2, General
Recommendations on Immunization, for details).
21
Varicella Vaccine Use in
Immunocompromised Persons
• MMRV not approved for use in
persons with HIV infection
• Do not administer zoster vaccine to
immunosuppressed persons
Persons with moderate or severe cellular immunodefi-
ciency resulting from infection with human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV), including persons diagnosed with
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) should not
receive varicella vaccine. HIV-infected children with CD4
T-lymphocyte percentage of 15% or higher, and older
children and adults with a CD4 count of 200 per microliter
or higher may be considered for vaccination. These persons
may receive MMR and single-antigen varicella vaccines, but
should not receive MMRV.
Women known to be pregnant or attempting to become
pregnant should not receive a varicella-containing vaccine.
To date, no adverse outcomes of pregnancy or in a fetus
have been reported among women who inadvertently
received varicella vaccine shortly before or during preg-
nancy. Although the manufacturer's package insert states
otherwise, ACIP recommends that pregnancy be avoided for
1 month following receipt of varicella vaccine.
The ACIP recommends prenatal assessment and postpartum
vaccination for varicella. Women should be assessed during a
prenatal healthcare visit for evidence of varicella immunity.

cating the management of an ill patient with a potential
vaccine adverse event, such as fever. Minor illness, such as
otitis media and upper respiratory infections, concurrent
antibiotic therapy, and exposure or recovery from other
illnesses are not contraindications to varicella vaccine.
Although there is no evidence that either varicella or
varicella vaccine exacerbates tuberculosis, vaccination is not
recommended for persons known to have untreated active
tuberculosis. Tuberculosis skin testing is not a prerequisite
for varicella vaccination.

The effect of the administration of antibody-containing blood
products (e.g., immune globulin, whole blood or packed red
blood cells, or intravenous immune globulin) on the response
to varicella vaccine virus is unknown. Because of the potential
inhibition of the response to varicella vaccination by passively
transferred antibodies, varicella or MMRV vaccine should not
be administered for 3–11 months after receipt of antibody-
containing blood products. ACIP recommends applying
the same intervals used to separate antibody-containing
products and MMR to varicella vaccine (see chapter 2, General
Recommendations on Immunization, and Appendix A for
additional details). Immune globulin should not be given for 3
weeks following vaccination unless the benefits exceed those
of the vaccine. In such cases, the vaccinees should either be
revaccinated or tested for immunity at least 3 months later
(depending on the antibody-containing product administered)
and revaccinated if seronegative.

are at increased risk for febrile seizures compared with
children without such histories. Children with a personal or

the risks for using MMRV vaccine in this group of children
generally outweigh the benefits.

No adverse events following varicella vaccination related to
the use of salicylates (e.g., aspirin) have been reported to date.
However, the manufacturer recommends that vaccine recipi-
ents avoid the use of salicylates for 6 weeks after receiving
varicella or MMRV vaccine because of the association between
aspirin use and Reye syndrome following chickenpox.

Zoster Vaccine
Contraindications and Precautions
Zoster Vaccine
As with all vaccines, a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine
component or following a prior dose is a contraindication
to zoster vaccination. As with other live virus vaccines,
pregnancy or planned pregnancy within 4 weeks and immu-
nosuppression are contraindications to zoster vaccination.
• Severe allergic reaction to a vaccine
component or following a prior dose
• Pregnancy or planned pregnancy
within 4 weeks
• Immunosuppression from any cause
kin
DIE
Zoster vaccine should not be administered to persons
with primary or acquired immunodeficiency. This includes
persons with leukemia, lymphomas, or other malignant
neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system.
The package insert implies that zoster vaccine should not
be administered to anyone who has ever had leukemia
or lymphoma. However, ACIP recommends that persons
whose leukemia or lymphoma is in remission and who
have not received chemotherapy or radiation for at least
3 months can be vaccinated. Other immunosuppressive
conditions that contraindicate zoster vaccine include AIDS
or other clinical manifestation of HIV. This includes CD4
T-lymphocyte values less than 200 per mm or less than 15%
of total lymphocytes.

Zoster Vaccine
Precautions
Persons receiving high-dose corticosteroid therapy should
not be vaccinated. High dose is defined as 20 milligrams
or more per day of prednisone or equivalent lasting two
or more weeks. Zoster vaccination should be deferred for
at least 1 month after discontinuation of therapy. As with
other live viral vaccines, persons receiving lower doses of
corticosteroids may be vaccinated. Topical, inhaled or intra-
articular steroids, or long-term alternate-day treatment with
low to moderate doses of short-acting systemic corticoste-
roids are not considered to be sufficiently immunosuppres-
sive to contraindicate zoster vaccine.
• Moderate or severe acute illness
tai
• Current treatment with an antiviral
drug active against herpesviruses
• Recent receipt of a blood product is
NOT a precaution
lad
Low doses of drugs used for the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other conditions,
such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or 6-mercaptopurine,
are also not considered sufficiently immunosuppressive to
create safety concerns for zoster vaccine. Low-dose therapy
with these drugs is NOT a contraindication for administration
of zoster vaccine.

The experience of hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipi-
ents with varicella-containing vaccines, including zoster
vaccine is limited. Physicians should assess the immune
status of the recipient on a case-by-case basis to determine
the relevant risks. If a decision is made to vaccinate with
zoster vaccine, the vaccine should be administered at least
24 months after transplantation.

The safety and efficacy of zoster vaccine administered
concurrently with recombinant human immune mediators
and immune modulators (such as the anti-tumor necrosis
factor agents adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept) is not
known. It is preferable to administer zoster vaccine before
treatment with these drugs. If it is not possible to administer
zoster vaccine to patients before initiation of treatment,
physicians should assess the immune status of the recipient
on a case-by-case basis to determine the relevant risks and
benefits. Otherwise, vaccination with zoster vaccine should
be deferred for at least 1 month after discontinuation of

As with all vaccines, moderate or severe acute illness is
a precaution to vaccination. Current treatment with an
antiviral drug active against herpesviruses, such as acyclovir,
famciclovir, or valacyclovir, is a precaution to vaccination.
These drugs can interfere with replication of the vaccine
virus. Persons taking these drugs should discontinue them
at least 24 hours before administration of zoster vaccine,
and the drugs should not be taken for at least 14 days after
vaccination.

Persons with a history of varicella are immune and gener-

amount of antibody in the person's blood. As a result, unlike
most other live virus vaccines, recent receipt of a blood
product is not a precaution for zoster vaccine. Zoster vaccine
can be administered at any time before, concurrent with,
or after receiving blood or other antibody-containing blood
products.

reactions are generally mild and self-limited. A varicella-like
rash at injection site is reported by 3% of children and by 1%
of adolescents and adults following the second dose. In both
circumstances, a median of two lesions have been present.
These lesions generally occur within 2 weeks, and are most
commonly maculopapular rather than vesicular. A general-
ized varicella-like rash is reported by 4%-6% of recipients of
varicella vaccine (1% after the second dose in adolescents
and adults), with an average of five lesions. Most of these
generalized rashes occur within 3 weeks and most are
maculopapular.
Systemic reactions are not common. Fever within 42 days
of vaccination is reported by 15% of children and 10% of
adolescents and adults. The majority of these episodes of
fever have been attributed to concurrent illness rather than
to the vaccine.
Zoster Following Vaccination
• Most cases in children
• Not all cases caused by vaccine
virus
• Risk from vaccine virus less than
from wild-type virus
• Usually a mild illness without
complications such as postherpetic
neuralgia
Varicella vaccine is a live virus vaccine and may result in
a latent infection, similar to that caused by wild varicella
virus. Consequently, zoster caused by the vaccine virus has
been reported, mostly among vaccinated children. Not all
these cases have been confirmed as having been caused
by vaccine virus. The risk of zoster following vaccination
appears to be less than that following infection with wild-
type virus. The majority of cases of zoster following vaccine
have been mild and have not been associated with compli-
cations such as postherpetic neuralgia.
21
MMRV Vaccine
In MMRV vaccine prelicensure studies conducted among
children 12–23 months of age, fever (reported as abnormal
or elevated 102°F or higher oral equivalent) was observed
5-12 days after vaccination in 21.5% of MMRV vaccine recipi-
ents compared with 14.9% of MMR vaccine and varicella
vaccine recipients. Measles-like rash was observed in 3.0%
of MMRV vaccine recipients compared with 2.1% of those
receiving MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine.
Two postlicensure studies indicated that among children 12
-23 months of age, one additional febrile seizure occurred
5–12 days after vaccination per 2,300—2,600 children who
had received the first dose of MMRV vaccine compared with
children who had received the first dose of MMR vaccine
and varicella vaccine administered as separate injections
at the same visit. Data from postlicensure studies do not
suggest that children 4-6 years of age who received the
second dose of MMRV vaccine had an increased risk for
febrile seizures after vaccination compared with children the
same age who received MMR vaccine and varicella vaccine
administered as separate injections at the same visit.

Transmission of Varicella Vaccine Virus
Available data suggest that transmission of varicella vaccine
virus is a rare event. Instances of suspected secondary
transmission of vaccine virus have been reported, but in
few instances has the secondary clinical illness been shown
to be caused by vaccine virus. Several cases of suspected
secondary transmission have been determined to have
been caused by wild varicella virus. In studies of household
contacts, several instances of asymptomatic seroconversion
have been observed. It appears that transmission occurs
mainly, and perhaps only, when the vaccinee develops
a rash. If a vaccinated child develops a rash, it is recom-
mended that close contact with persons who do not have
evidence of varicella immunity and who are at high risk of
complications of varicella, such as immunocompromised
persons, be avoided until the rash has resolved.

Vaccine Storage and Handling
All varicella-containing vaccines should be stored in a
continuously frozen state at the manufacturer recommended
freezer temperature until administration. Varicella and zoster
vaccines should be stored at +5°F (-15°C) or colder. The
combination vaccine measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella
(MMRV) should also be stored frozen between -58°F and +5°F
(-50°C to -15°C). If varicella and zoster vaccines are stored in
the freezer with MMRV, keep the temperature between -58°F
and +5°F (-50°C to -15°C).

ported and stored at refrigerator temperatures, between 35°F
and 46°F (2°C to 8°C), for no more than 72 continuous hours
prior to reconstitution. Vaccine stored between 35°F and 46°F
(2°C to 8°C) that is not used within 72 hours of removal from
the freezer should be discarded. Varicella-containing vaccines
cannot be refrozen. Providers should contact their immuniza-
tion program for advice and details.
Having a patient pick up a dose of vaccine (e.g., zoster
vaccine) at a pharmacy and transporting it in a bag to a clinic
for administration is not an acceptable transport method for
zoster vaccine or any other vaccine.
The vaccine diluent should be stored separately at room
temperature or in the refrigerator. The vaccine should be
reconstituted according to the directions in the package
insert and only with the diluent supplied (or with the
diluent supplied for MMR vaccine), which does not contain
preservative or other antiviral substances that might
inactivate the vaccine virus. Once reconstituted, all varicella-
containing vaccines must be used immediately to minimize
loss of potency. The vaccine must be discarded if not used
within 30 minutes of reconstitution.

Varicella Zoster immune Globulin
In 2004, the only U.S.-licensed manufacturer of varicella
zoster immune globulin (VZIG) (Massachusetts Public Health
Biologic Laboratories, Boston, Massachusetts) discontinued
production of VZIG. The supply of the licensed VZIG
product was depleted in early 2006. In February 2006, an
investigational (not licensed) VZIG product, VariZiG (Cangene
Corporation, Winnipeg, Canada) became available under an
investigational new drug application (IND) submitted to the
FDA. This product can be requested from the sole authorized
U.S. distributor, FFF Enterprises (Temecula, California), for
patients who have been exposed to varicella and who are at
increased risk for severe disease and complications.
The investigational VariZiG, similar to licensed VZIG, is a
purified human immune globulin preparation made from
plasma containing high levels of anti-varicella antibodies
(immunoglobulin class G [1gG]). Unlike the previous product,
the investigational product is lyophilized. When properly
reconstituted, VariZiG is approximately a 5% solution of
IgG that can be administered intramuscularly. As with any
product used under IND, patients must be informed of

This schedule includes recommendations in effect as of December 21, 2010. Any dose not administered at the recommended age should be administered at a
subsequent visit, when indicated and feasible. The use of a combination vaccine generally is preferred over separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines.
Considerations should include provider assessment, patient preference, and the potential for adverse events. Providers should consult the relevant Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices statement for detailed recommendations: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm. Clinically significant adverse events that follow
immunization should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at http://www.vaers.hhs.gov or by telephone, 800-822-7967.

Footnotes
Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule UNITED STATES - 2011
For complete statements by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), visit www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/ACIP-list.htm.
1. Influenza vaccination
Annual vaccination against influenza is recommended for all persons aged 6 months and older, including all adults. Healthy, nonpregnant adults aged less than 50 years without
high-risk medical conditions can receive either intranasally administered live, attenuated influenza vaccine (Flumíst), or inactivated vaccine. Other persons should receive the inactivated
vaccine. Adults aged 65 years and older can receive the standard influenza vaccine or the high-dose (Fluzone) influenza vaccine. Additional information about influenza vaccination is
available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/tlu/default.htm.
2. Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Td/Tdap) vaccination
Administer a one-time dose of Tdap to adults aged less than 65 years who have not received Tdap previously or for whom vaccine status is unknown to replace one of the 10-year Td
boosters, and as soon as feasible to all 1) postpartum women, 2) close contacts of infants younger than age 12 months (e.g. grandparents and child-care providers), and 3) healthcare
personnel with direct patient contact. Adults aged 65 years and older who have not previously received Tdap and who have close contact with an infant aged less than 12 months also
should be vaccinated. Other adults aged 65 years and older may receive Tdap. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since the most recent tetanus or diphtheria-containing
vaccine
Adults with uncertain or incomplete history of completing a 3-dose primary vaccination series with Td-containing vaccines should begin or complete a primary vaccination series. For
unvaccinated adults, administer the first 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart and the third dose 6-12 months after the second. If incompletely vaccinated (i.e., less than 3 doses), administer
remaining doses. Substitute a one-time dose of Tdap for one of the doses of Td, either in the primary series or for the routine booster, whichever comes first.
If a woman is pregnant and received the most recent Td vaccination 10 or more years previously, administer Td during the second or third trimester. If the woman received the most
recent Td vaccination less than 10 years previously, administer Tdap during the immediate postpartum period. At the clinician's discretion, Td may be deferred during pregnancy and Tdap
substituted in the immediate postpartum period, or Tdap may be administered instead of Td to a pregnant woman after an informed discussion with the woman.
The ACIP statement for recommendations for administering Td as prophylaxis in wound management is available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm.
3. Varicella vaccination
All adults without evidence of immunity to varicella should receive 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine if not previously vaccinated or a second dose if they have received only
1 dose, unless they have a medical contraindication. Special consideration should be given to those who 1) have close contact with persons at high risk for severe disease (e.g., healthcare
personnel and family contacts of persons with immunocompromising conditions) or 2) are at high risk for exposure or transmission (e.g., teachers, child-care employees; residents and
staff members of institutional settings, including correctional institutions, college students, military personnel, adolescents and adults living in households with children, nonpregnant
women of childbearing age, and international travelers).
Evidence of immunity to varicella in adults includes any of the following: 1) documentation of 2 doses of varicella vaccine at least 4 weeks apart: 2) U.S.-born before 1980 (although
for healthcare personnel and pregnant women, birth before 1980 should not be considered evidence of immunity); 3) history of varicella based on diagnosis or verification of varicella
by a healthcare provider (for a patient reporting a history of or having an atypical case, a mild case, or both, healthcare providers should seek either an epidemiologic link with a typical
varicella case or to a laboratory-confirmed case or evidence of laboratory confirmation, it it was performed at the time of acute disease): 4) history of herpes zoster based on diagnosis or
verification of herpes zoster by a healthcare provider; or 5) laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease.
Pregnant women should be assessed for evidence of varicella immunity. Women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive the first dose of varicella vaccine upon
completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge from the healthcare facility. The second dose should be administered 4-8 weeks after the first dose.
4. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination
HPV vaccination with either quadrivalent (HPV4) vaccine or bivalent vaccine (HPV2) is recommended for females at age 11 or 12 years and catch-up vaccination for females aged 13
through 26 years.
Ideally, vaccine should be administered before potential exposure to HPV through sexual activity; however, females who are sexually active should still be vaccinated consistent with
age-based recommendations. Sexually active females who have not been infected with any of the tour HPV vaccine types (types 6, 11, 16, and 18, all of which HPV4 prevents) or any
of the two HPV vaccine types (types 16 and 18, both of which HPV2 prevents) receive the full benefit of the vaccination. Vaccination is less beneficial for females who have already been
infected with one or more of the HPV vaccine types. HPV4 or HPV2 can be administered to persons with a history of genital warts, abnormal Papanicolaou test, or positive HPV DNA test,
because these conditions are not evidence of previous infection with all vaccine HPV types.
HPV4 may be administered to males aged 9 through 26 years to reduce their likelihood of genital warts. HPV4 would be most effective when administered before exposure to HPV
through sexual contact.
A complete series for either HPV4 or HPV2 consists of 3 doses. The second dose should be administered 1-2 months after the first dose; the third dose should be administered 6
months after the first dose.
Although HPV vaccination is not specifically recommended for persons with the medical indications described in Figure 2, "Vaccines that might be indicated for adults based on
medical and other indications," it may be administered to these persons because the HPV vaccine is not a live-virus vaccine. However, the immune response and vaccine efficacy might be
less for persons with the medical indications described in Figure 2 than in persons who do not have the medical indications described or who are immunocompetent.
5. Herpes zoster vaccination
A single dose of zoster vaccine is recommended for adults aged 60 years and older regardless of whether they report a previous episode of herpes zoster. Persons with chronic
medical conditions may be vaccinated unless their condition constitutes a contraindication.
6. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination
Adults born before 1957 generally are considered immune to measles and mumps. All adults born in 1957 or later should have documentation of 1 or more doses of MMR vaccine
unless they have a medical contraindication to the vaccine, laboratory evidence of immunity to each of the three diseases, or documentation of provider-diagnosed measles or mumps
disease. For rubella, documentation of provider-diagnosed disease is not considered acceptable evidence of immunity.
Measles component: A second dose of MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first dose, is recommended for adults who 1) have been recently exposed to
measles or are in an outbreak setting; 2) are students in postsecondary educational institutions; 3) work in a healthcare facility; or 4) plan to travel internationally. Persons who received
inactivated (killed) measles vaccine or measles vaccine of unknown type during 1963–1967 should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine.
Mumps component: A second dose of MMR vaccine, administered a minimum of 28 days after the first dose, is recommended for adults who 1) live in a community experiencing
a mumps outbreak and are in an affected age group; 2) are students in postsecondary educational institutions; 3) work in a healthcare facility; or 4) plan to travel internationally. Persons
vaccinated before 1979 with either killed mumps vaccine or mumps vaccine of unknown type who are at high risk for mumps infection (e.g. persons who are working in a healthcare
facility) should be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine.
Kubella component: For women of childbearing age, regardless of birth year, rubella immunity should be determined. If there is no evidence of immunity, women who are not
pregnant should be vaccinated. Pregnant women who do not have evidence of immunity should receive MMR vaccine upon completion or termination of pregnancy and before discharge
from the healthcare facility.
Healthcare personnel born before 1957: For unvaccinated healthcare personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps, and/or rubella immunity or
laboratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should 1) consider routinely vaccinating personnel with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for measies and
mumps) and 1 dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), and 2) recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval during an outbreak of measles or mumps, and 1 dose during an
outbreak of rubella. Complete information about evidence of immunity is available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/provisional/default.htm.
7. Pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPSV) vaccination
Vaccinate all persons with the following indications:
Medicat
. Chronic lung disease (including asthma); chronic cardiovascular diseases; diabetes mellitus; chronic liver diseases; cirrhosis; chronic alcoholism; functional or anatomic
asplenia (e g., sickle cell disease or splenectomy (it elective splenectomy is planned, vaccinate at least 2 weeks before surgery]); immunocompromising conditions (including chronic renal
failure or nephrotic syndrome); and cochlear implants and cerebrospinal fluid leaks. Vaccinate as close to HIV diagnosis as possible.
Other. Residents of nursing homes or long-term care facilities and persons who smoke cigarettes. Routine use of PPSV is not recommended for American Indians/Alaska Natives
or persons aged less than 65 years unless they have underlying medical conditions that are PPSV indications. However, public health authorities may consider recommending PPSV for
American Indians/Alaska Natives and persons aged 50 through 64 years who are living in areas where the risk for invasive pneumococcal disease is increased
8. Revaccination with PPSV
One-time revaccination after 5 years is recommended for persons aged 19 through 64 years with chronic renal failure or nephrotic syndrome; functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g.,
sickle cell disease or splenectomy); and for persons with immunocompromising conditions. For persons aged 65 years and older, one-time revaccination is recommended if they were
vaccinated 5 or more years previously and were aged less than 65 years at the time of primary vaccination.
9. Meningococcal vaccination
Meningococcal vaccine should be administered to persons with the following indications:
Medicat
. A 2-dose series of meningococcal vaccine is recommended for adults with anatomic or functional asplenia, or persistent complement component deficiencies. Adults with
HIV infection who are vaccinated should also receive a routine 2-dose series. The 2 doses should be administered at 0 and 2 months.
Other. A single dose of meningococcal vaccine is recommended for unvaccinated first-year college students living in dormitories; microbiologists routinely exposed to isolates
of Neisseria meningitidis, military recruits; and persons who travel to or live in countries in which meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic (e.g., the "meningitis belt" of
sub-Saharan Africa during the dry season (December through June]), particularly if their contact with local populations will be prolonged. Vaccination is required by the government of
Saudi Arabia for all travelers to Mecca during the annual Hajj.
Meningococcal conjugate vaccine, quadrivalent (MCV4) is preferred for adults with any of the preceding indications who are aged 55 years and younger, meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) is preferred for adults aged 56 years and older. Revaccination with MCV4 every 5 years is recommended for adults previously vaccinated with MCV4 or
MPSV4 who remain at increased risk for infection (e.g., adults with anatomic or functional asplenia, or persistent complement component deficiencies).

10. Hepatitis A vaccination
Vaccinate persons with any of the following indications and any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection:
Behavioral. Men who have sex with men and persons who use injection drugs.
Occupational
. Persons working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting.
Medicat. Persons with chronic liver disease and persons who receive clotting factor concentrates.
Other. Persons traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A (a list of countries is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/
contentdiseases.aspx).
Unvaccinated persons who anticipate close personal contact (e.g., household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the first 60 days after arrival in the United
States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity should be vaccinated. The first dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is
planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.
Single-antigen vaccine formulations should be administered in a 2-dose schedule at either 0 and 6-12 months (Havrix), or 0 and 6-18 months (Vaqta). If the combined hepatitis A
and hepatitis B vaccine (Twinrix) is used, administer 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; alternatively, a 4-dose schedule may be used, administered on days 0, 7, and 21-30, followed by a
booster dose at month 12.
11. Hepatitis B vaccination
Vaccinate persons with any of the following indications and any person seeking protection from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection:
Behavioral. Sexually active persons who are not in a long-term, mutually monogamous relationship (e.g., persons with more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months);
persons seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually transmitted disease (STD); current or recent injection-drug users, and men who have sex with men.
Occupational Healthcare personnel and public-safety workers who are exposed to blood or other potentially infectious body fluids.
Medicat. Persons with end-stage renal disease, including patients receiving hemodialysis; persons with HIV infection; and persons with chronic liver disease.
Other. Household contacts and sex partners of persons with chronic HBV infection; clients and staff members of institutions for persons with developmental disabilities; and
international travelers to countries with high or intermediate prevalence of chronic HBV infection (a list of countries is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentdiseases.aspx).
Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all adults in the following settings: STD treatment facilities; HIV testing and treatment facilities; facilities providing drug-abuse treatment
and prevention services; healthcare settings targeting services to injection-drug users or men who have sex with men; correctional facilities; end-stage renal disease programs and
facilities for chronic hemodialysis patients; and institutions and nonresidential day-care facilities for persons with developmental disabilities.
Administer missing doses to complete a 3-dose series of hepatitis B vaccine to those persons not vaccinated or not completely vaccinated. The second dose should be administered
1 month after the first dose; the third dose should be given at least 2 months after the second dose (and at least 4 months after the first dose). If the combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B
vaccine (Twinrix) is used, administer 3 doses at 0, 1, and 6 months; alternatively, a 4-dose Twinrix schedule, administered on days 0,7, and 21 to 30, followed by a booster dose at month
12 may be used.
Adult patients receiving hemodialysis or with other immunocompromising conditions should receive 1 dose of 40 pg/mL (Recombivax HB) administered on a 3-dose schedule or 2
doses of 20 pg/mL (Engerix-B) administered simultaneously on a 4-dose schedule at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months.
12. Selected conditions for which Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine may be used
1 dose of Hib vaccine should be considered for persons who have sickle cell disease, leukemia, or HIV infection, or who have had a splenectomy, if they have not previously received
Hib vaccine.
13. Immunocompromising conditions
Inactivated vaccines generally are acceptable (e.g., pneumococcal, meningococcal, influenza (inactivated influenza vaccine]) and live vaccines generally are avoided in persons with
immune deficiencies or immunocompromising conditions. Information on specific conditions is available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm.

1 Combination vaccines are available. Use of licensed combination vaccines is generally preferred to separate injections of their
equivalent component vaccines. When administering combination vaccines, the minimum age for administration is the oldest age for
any of the individual components; the minimum interval between doses is equal to the greatest interval of any of the individual
components.
1 of 4)
2 Information on travel vaccines including typhoid, Japanese encephalitis, and yellow fever, is available at www.cdc.gov/travel.
Information on other vaccines that are licensed in the US but not distributed, including anthrax and smallpox, is available at
www.bt.cdc.gov.
3 Combination vaccines containing a hepatitis B component (Comvax, Pediarix, and Twinrix) are available. These vaccines should
not be administered to infants younger than 6 weeks because of the other components (i.e., Hib, DTP, HepA, and IPV).
4 HepB-3 should be administered at least 8 weeks after HepB-2 and at least 16 weeks after HepB-1, and should not be
administered before age 24 weeks.
5 Calendar months.
5 The minimum recommended interval between DTP-3 and DTP-4 is 6 months. However, DTP-4 need not be repeated if
administered at least 4 months after DTaP-3.
7 Children receiving the first dose of Hib or PCV vaccine at age 7 months or older require fewer doses to complete the series.
8 If PRP-OMP (Pedvax-Hib) was administered at ages 2 and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not required.
9 A fourth dose is not needed if the third dose was administered on or after the 4th birthday and at least 6 months after the previous
dose.
10 Combination measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine can be used for children aged 12 months through 12 years. (See
CDC. General recommendations on Immunization: recommendations of the ACIP, MMWR 2011;60(No. RR-2],7.)
11 For persons beginning the series on or after the 13th birthday, the minimum interval from varicella-1 to varicella-2 is 4 weeks.
12 One dose of influenza vaccine per season is recommended for most people. Children younger than 9 years of age who are receiving
influenza vaccine for the first time, or received only 1 dose the previous season (if it was their first vaccination season) should receive
2 doses this season.
13 The minimum age for inactivated influenza vaccine varies by vaccine manufacturer and formulation. See package inserts for vaccine-
specific minimum ages.
14 Revaccination with meningococcal vaccine is recommended for previously vaccinated persons who remain at high risk for
meningococcal disease. (See CDC. Updated recommendations from the ACIP for vaccination of persons at prolonged increased risk
for meningococcal disease. MMWR 2009;58:[1042-31)

15 Only one dose of Tdap is recommended. Subsequent doses should be given as Td. For one brand of Tdap (Adacel), the minimum
age is 11 years. For management of a tetanus-prone wound in a person who has received a primary series of a tetanus-toxoid
containing vaccine, there is no minimum interval between a previous dose of any tetanus-containing vaccine and Tdap.
16 A second dose of PPSV 5 years after the first dose is recommended for persons <65 years of age at highest risk for serious
pneumococcal infection, and for those who are likely to have a rapid decline in pneumococcal antibody concentration. (See CDC.
Prevention of pneumococcal disease: recommendations of the ACIP. MMWR 1997;46[No. RR-8].)
17 Bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix) is approved for females 10 through 25 years of age. Quadravalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil) is
approved for males and females 9 through 26 years of age.
18 The minimum age for HPV-3 is based on the baseline minimum age for the first dose (108 months) and the minimum interval of 24
weeks between the first and third doses. Dose 3 need not be repeated if it is given at least 16 weeks after the first dose.
19 The first dose of rotavirus must be administered between 6 weeks 0 days and 14 weeks 6 days. The vaccine series should not be
started after age 15 weeks 0 days. Rotavirus should not be administered to children older than 8 months 0 days, less of the
number of doses received before that age.
FA
20 If two doses of Rotarix are administered as age appropriate, a third dose is not necessary.
21 Herpes zoster vaccine is recommended as a single dose for persons 60 years of age and older.

Previous anaphylactic reaction to this vaccine or to any of its
components, including diphtheria toxoid (for MCV4).
Precautions
• Moderate or severe acute illness.
• In pregnancy, studies of vaccination with MPSV4 have not docu-
mented adverse effects so may use MPSV4, if indicated. No data
are available on the safety of MCV4 during pregnancy.
•Give 2 initial doses separated by 2m to adults
with anatomic or functional asplenia, persistent
complement component deficiencies, or HIV
infection.
• Give 1 initial dose to all other adults with risk
factors (see 2nd 4th bullets in column to left).
Give booster doses every 5yrs to adults with
continuing risk (see the 1st-3rd bullets in col-
umn to left for listings of people with possible
continuing risk).

and older.
Note: Adults living in the U.S. who never received or com-
pleted a primary series of polio vaccine need not be vacci-
nated unless they intend to travel to areas where exposure
to wild-type virus is likely. Previously vaccinated adults
can receive 1 booster dose if traveling to polio endemic
areas or to areas where the risk of exposure is high.

This table is not intended for determining the correct indications and dosages for using antibody-containing products. Unvaccinated persons might not be fully protected against measles
during the entire recommended interval, and additional doses of IG or measles vaccine might be indicated after measles exposure. Concentrations of measles antibody in an IG
preparation can vary by manufacturer's lot. Rates of antibody clearance after receipt of an IG preparation also might vary. Recommended intervals are extrapolated from an estimated
half-life of 30 days for passively acquired antibody and an observed interference with the immune response to measles vaccine for 5 months after a dose of 80 mg IgG/kg.
1 Does not include zoster vaccine. Zoster vaccine may be given with antibody-containing blood products.
2 Assumes a serum IgG concentration of 16 mg/mL.
3 Measles and varicella vaccinations are recommended for children with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but are contraindicated for
persons with severe immunosuppression from HIV or any other immunosuppressive disorder.
4 The investigational product VariZIG, similar to licensed VZIG, is a purified human IG preparation made from plasma containing high levels of anti-varicella antibodies (IgG). The
interval between VariZiG and varicella vaccine (Var or MMRV) is 5 months.

1. Events or conditions listed as precautions should be reviewed carefully. Benefits of and
risks for administering a specific vaccine to a person under these circumstances should
be considered. If the risk from the vaccine is believed to outweigh the benefit, the vac-
cine should not be administered. If the benefit of vaccination is believed to outweigh the
risk, the vaccine should be administered. Whether and when to administer DTP to chil-
dren with proven or suspected underlying neurologic disorders should be decided on a
case-by-case basis.
2. Hepatitis B vaccination should be deferred for preterm infants and infants weigh-
ing less than 2000 g if the mother is documented to be hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg)-negative at the time of the infant's birth. Vaccination can commence at
chronological age 1 month or at hospital discharge. For infants born to women who
are HBsAg-positive, hepatitis B immunoglobulin and hepatitis B vaccine should be
administered within 12 hours of birth, regardless of weight.
3. For details, see CDC. "Prevention of Rotavirus Gastroenteritis among Infants and
Children: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
(ACIP)" MMWR 2009;58(NO. RR-2) at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm.
4. LAIV, MMR, and varicella vaccines can be administered on the same day. If not admin-
istered on the same day, these vaccines should be separated by at least 28 days.
5. Substantially immunosuppressive steroid dose is considered to be 2 weeks or more of
daily receipt of 20 mg (or 2 mg/kg body weight) of prednisone or equivalent.
6. HIV-infected children may receive varicella and measles vaccine if CD4+ T-lympho-
cyte count is >15%. (Source: Adapted from American Academy of Pediatrics. Passive
Immunization. In: Pickering LK, ed. Red Book: 2009 Report of the Committee on Infec-
tious Diseases. 28th ed. Elk Grove Village, IL: American Academy of Pediatrics: 2009.)
7. Vaccine should be deferred for the appropriate interval if replacement immune globulin
products are being administered (see Table 5 in CDC. “General Recommendations on
Immunization: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-
tices (ACIP) at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/acip-list.htm.)
8. Measles vaccination might suppress tuberculin reactivity temporarily. Measles-con-
taining vaccine can be administered on the same day as tuberculin skin testing. If
testing cannot be performed until after the day of MMR vaccination, the test should be
postponed for at least 4 weeks after the vaccination. If an urgent need exists to skin
test, do so with the understanding that reactivity might be reduced by the vaccine.

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), 2010” at www.cdc.gov/vac-
cines/pubs/acip-list.htm.

Appendix B
Vaccine Excipient & Media Summary
This section begins with a summary of the excipients included in licensed vaccines in the
United States, as of the revision date at the bottom of the page.
Excipients are inactive ingredients of a drug product necessary for production of a finished
pharmaceutical formulation.
After the list of excipients is a list of culture media used in the manufacturing process of vac-
cines licensed in the United States.
Growth media are culture materials used to produce mass quantities of a microorganism anti-
body, or other immunologic agent, suitable for further processing into a finished pharma-
ceutical product.
All reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of this information, but manu-
facturers may change product contents before that information is reflected here.

Latex in Vaccine Packaging
“If a person reports a severe (anaphylactic) allergy to latex, vaccines supplied in vials or
syringes that contain natural rubber should not be administered unless the benefit of
vaccination outweighs the risk for a potential allergic reaction. In these cases, providers
should be prepared to treat patients who are having an allergic reaction. For latex
allergies other than anaphylactic allergies (e.g., a history of contact allergy to latex
gloves), vaccines supplied in vials or syringes that contain dry natural rubber or rubber
latex may be administered.” (ACIP General Recommendations on Immunization. 2011)

1. A concentration of 1:10,000 is equivalent to a 0.01% concentration. Thimerosal is approximately 50% Hg by weight. A 1:10,000
concentration contains 25 mcg of Hg per 0.5 mL.
(2). A previously marketed lyophilized preparation contained 0.005% thimerosal.
(3). COMVAX is not approved for use under 6 weeks of age because of decreased response to the Hib component
* This product should be considered equivalent to thimerosal-free products. This vaccine may contain trace amounts (<0.3 mcg) of
mercury left after post-production thimerosal removal; these amounts have no biological effect. JAMA 1999;282(18) and JAMA
2000;283(16).

Foreign Language Terms
Aids to translating foreign immunization records.
Table 1:
Disease, Vaccine, and Related Terms. This table lists terms for vaccine-
preventable diseases and vaccines, and other terms that might be found on an
immunization record, by language.
Table 2:
Trade Names. This table lists the names of specific vaccines that are used, or
have been used, internationally, along with the manufacturer and country or
region where the vaccine is produced or used, when known.
These tables have been adapted from (among other sources)
lists developed by
the Minnesota Department of Health Immunization Program
(now maintained by the Immunization Action Coalition)
and

Appendix C
Checklist for Safe Vaccine Handling and Storage
Here are the 20 most important things you can do to safeguard your vaccine supply. Are you doing them all?
Reviewing this list can help you improve your clinic's vaccine management practices.
Yes No
1. We have a designated person in charge of the handling and storage of our vaccines.
2. We have a back-up person in charge of the handling and storage of our vaccines.
3. A vaccine inventory log is maintained that documents:
Vaccine name and number of doses received
Date the vaccine was received
Arrival condition of vaccine
Vaccine manufacturer and lot number
Vaccine expiration date
4.

Our refrigerator for vaccines is either household-style or commercial-style, NOT
dormitory-style. The freezer compartment has a separate exterior door. Alternatively, we
use two storage units: a free-standing refrigerator and a separate, free-standing freezer.
We do NOT store any food or drink in the refrigerator or freezer.
We store vaccines in the middle of the refrigerator or freezer, and JOT in the door.
We stock and rotate our vaccine supply so that the newest vaccine of each type (with the
longest expiration date) is placed behind the vaccine with the shortest expiration date.
We check vaccine expiration dates and we first use those that will expire soonest.
We post a sign on the refrigerator door showing which vaccines should be stored in the
refrigerator and which should be stored in the freezer.
We always keep a thermometer in the refrigerator.
The temperature in the refrigerator is maintained at 35–46°F (2–8°C).
We keep extra containers of water in the refrigerator to help maintain cold temperatures.
We always keep a thermometer in the freezer.
The temperature in the freezer is maintained at +5°F (-15°C) or colder.
We keep ice packs and other ice-filled containers in the freezer to help maintain cold
temperatures.
We post a temperature log on the refrigerator door on which we record the refrigerator
and freezer temperatures twice a day—first thing in the morning and at clinic closing time-
and we know whom to call if the temperature goes out of range.
We have a "Do Not Unplug" sign next to the refrigerator's electrical outlet.
In the event of a refrigerator failure, we take the following steps:
We assure that the vaccines are placed in a location with adequate refrigeration.
We mark exposed vaccines and separate them from undamaged vaccines.
We note the refrigerator or freezer temperature and contact the vaccine manufac-

We follow the vaccine manufacturer's or health department's instructions as to
whether the affected vaccines can be used, and, if so, we mark the vials with the
revised expiration date provided by the manufacturer or health department.
We have obtained a detailed written policy for general and emergency vaccine management
from our local or state health department.

Order vaccine carefully.
Inventory your vaccine at least monthly and before placing
an order. Expired vaccine must never be used and is money
wasted!
Stabilize temperatures.
Store ice packs in the freezer and large jugs of water in the
refrigerator along with the vaccine. This will help maintain
a stable, cold temperature in case of a power failure or if
the refrigerator or freezer doors are opened frequently or
left open. Frequent opening of the refrigerator unit's doors
can lead to temperature variations inside, which could affect
vaccine efficacy. For this reason you should not store food
or beverages in the refrigerator or freezer.
Store vaccine correctly.
Refrigerate or freeze immediately upon receiving shipment.
Do not store vaccine in the door of the refrigerator or freezer.
Inactivated vaccines should always be placed in the middle
of the refrigerator far enough away from the freezer compart-
ment to protect them from freezing.
Always use the vaccine with the earliest
expiration date first.
Move vaccine with the earliest expiration date to the front
and mark it to be used first. Keep vials in their boxes. Never
use outdated vaccine.
Safeguard the electrical supply to the refrigerator.
Make sure the refrigerator is plugged into an outlet in a
protected area where it cannot be disconnected accidentally.
Label the refrigerator, electrical outlets, fuses, and circuit
breakers on the power circuit with information that clearly
identifies the perishable nature of vaccines and the immedi-
ate steps to be taken in case of interruption of power (use
DO NOT UNPLUG stickers). If your building has auxiliary
power, use the outlet supplied by that system.
*MMR may be stored in either the freezer or the refrigerator.
*Refer to package insert for specific instructions on the storage of each vaccine. If you have questions about the condition of the vaccine, you should
immediately place the vaccine in recommended storage and call the vaccine manufacturer(s) to determine whether the potency of the vaccine(s) has
been affected. For other questions, call the immunization program at your state or local health department.

Appendix D
Vaccine Administration
Appropriate vaccine administration is a critical component of a successful immunization
program. The following information provides general guidance for those who administer
vaccines and should be used in conjunction with professional standards of medication
administration and vaccine manufacturers' guidelines.
The “Rights of Medication Administration” should be applied to each encounter when vaccines
are administered. These rights include:
the right patient;
the right vaccine or diluent;
the right time*;
the right dosage;
the right route, needle length, and technique;
the right site; and,
the right documentation.
*(includes administering at the correct age, the appropriate interval, and before vaccine or diluent expires)
Staff Training and Education
All personnel who will administer vaccines should receive competency-based training and
education on vaccine administration before providing vaccines to patients. Providers need to
orient new staff to vaccines used in their office and validate staff's knowledge and skills about
vaccine administration with a skills checklist (refer to “Skills Checklist for Immunization” at
http://www.eziz.org/PDF/IMM-694.pdf). Providers should remember to include temporary
personnel who may be filling in on days when the clinic is short staffed or helping during peak
times such as flu season. Continuing education should be provided for all staff on the use and
administration of new vaccines, new schedules, and new or revised recommendations.
Patient Preparation and Care
Patients should be prepared for vaccination with consideration for their age and stage of
development. Parents/guardians and patients should be encouraged to take an active role before,
during and after the administration of vaccines (see “Be There for Your Child During Shots”
poster at http://www.eziz.org/PDF/IMM-686ES.pdf).
Screening - All patients should be screened for contraindications and precautions every time
a vaccine is administered, even if the patient has previously received a dose of that vaccine.
The patient's status can change from one visit to the next or a new contraindication or
precaution may have been added. Screening questions that should be asked of every patient
are included in Chapter 2. Many state immunization programs and other organizations have
developed standardized screening tools (see screening tools at
http://www.immunize.org/handouts/screening-vaccines.asp).

## p. 2 (#420) ##############################################

Appendix D
• Vaccine Safety & Risk Communication - There have been safety concerns about vaccines
since the 18th century when the first smallpox vaccination campaigns began. Specific vaccine
concerns have changed through time. An increasing number of parents, even those who
support vaccination, are beginning to raise vaccine safety concerns. Parents/guardians and
patients are exposed to information about vaccines through the media, internet, family
members, and friends. Some of this information is inaccurate and misleading.
A provider's recommendation for vaccination is a powerful motivator. Healthcare providers
are consistently identified as the most trusted source of vaccine information by parents and
patients. Immunization providers should be prepared to discuss the benefits and risks of
vaccines, as well as the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD), using Vaccine
Information Statements (VIS) and other reliable resources. Establishing an open dialogue
promotes a safe, trust-building environment in which individuals can freely evaluate
information, discuss vaccine concerns and make informed decisions regarding immunizations.
Providers are also encouraged to discuss after care instructions with patients or
parents/guardians (see additional information in Chapter 4 and Appendices E and F).
• Atraumatic Care - Vaccine safety issues and the need for multiple injections have increased
the concerns and anxiety associated with immunizations. Healthcare providers need to display
confidence and establish an environment that promotes a sense of security and trust for the
patient and family, utilizing a variety of techniques to minimize the stress and discomfort
associated with receiving injections. This is particularly important when administering
vaccines to children. Although pain from immunizations is, to some extent, unavoidable, there
are some things that parents and healthcare providers can do to help when children need
vaccines. Everyone involved should work to provide immunizations in the safest and least
stressful way possible. Simple strategies that can be used by both parents and providers to
make the process of receiving vaccines easier include:
displaying a positive attitude through facial expressions, body language, and comments;
• using a soft and calm tone of voice;
• making eye contact, even with small children;
• explaining why vaccines are needed (e.g., "this medicine will protect you from getting
sick” or “this shot is a shield to protect your body against infection"); and,
• being honest and explaining what to expect (e.g., do not say that the injection will not hurt).
• Positioning & Comforting Restraint - The healthcare provider should accommodate for the
patient's comfort, safety, age, activity level, and the site of administration when considering
patient positioning and restraint. A parent/guardian should be encouraged to hold the child
during administration. Parent participation has been shown to increase the child's comfort.
The parent/guardian should be instructed on how to help the child stay still so the vaccine can
be administered safely. If the parent is uncomfortable, another person may assist or the patient
may be positioned safely on an examination table (refer to "Comforting Restraint for
Immunizations" at http://www.eziz.org/PDF/IMM-720ES.pdf).

Research supports the belief that children are less fearful and experience less pain when
receiving an injection if they are sitting up rather than lying down. The mechanism behind this
D-2


## p. 3 (#421) ##############################################

Appendix D
phenomenon may be that the child's anxiety level is reduced, which in turn reduces the child's
perception of pain.
All providers who administer vaccines to older children, adolescents, and adults should be
aware of the potential for syncope (fainting) after vaccination and take measures to prevent it.
Clinicians should (1) make sure the person who is being vaccinated is always seated or lying
down; (2) be aware of symptoms that precede fainting (weakness, dizziness, pallor, etc.); and
(3) provide supportive care and take appropriate measures to prevent injuries if such symptoms
occur. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) also recommends that
providers consider observing the patient (with patient seated or lying down) for 15 minutes
after vaccination,
• Comfort Measures - Concern and anxiety about injections are common for all ages. Fear of
injections and needlestick pain are often cited as reasons why children and adults, including
healthcare personnel, refuse vaccines. Pain is a subjective phenomenon influenced by multiple
factors, including an individual's age, anxiety level, previous healthcare experiences, and
culture. Managing the pain associated with immunizations has the potential to improve
satisfaction with the immunization experience for children, adolescents, and adults.
Consideration for these factors is important as the provider develops a planned approach to
management of injection pain. Immunization providers are encouraged to determine the
patient's previous experiences with needlesticks. Evidence-based strategies to ease the
injection process include:
Antipyretics - An age-appropriate dose of a non-aspirin-containing pain reliever may be
considered to decrease discomfort and fever if it should occur after vaccination. ACIP
does not recommend the prophylactic use of analgesics before or at the time of
vaccination.
Distraction techniques – Age-appropriate, non-pharmacologic techniques may provide
distraction from pain associated with injections. Psychological interventions such as
distraction in children have been demonstrated to be effective at reducing stress and the
perception of pain during the injection process. Parents should be encouraged to use
distraction methods. Distraction can be accomplished through a variety of techniques
(e.g., playing music, books, pretending to blow away the pain, deep breathing
techniques).
Ingestion of sweet-tasting liquids or breastfeeding - Several studies have demonstrated
a reduction in crying after injections when young children (1 year or younger) ingest a
small amount (a few drops to half a teaspoon) of a sugary solution prior to administration
of the vaccine. This is a short-acting, inexpensive, easy-to-administer analgesic.
Breastfeeding has also been demonstrated as a soothing measure for young children
receiving injections and there is some evidence that breastfeeding can decrease the
incidence of fever after immunizations.
Order of injections – Injecting the most painful vaccine (e.g., MMR, PCV, or HPV) last
when multiple injections are being administered may also decrease the pain of injections.
Tactile stimulation - Rubbing or stroking the skin near the injection site with moderate
intensity may decrease pain in older children (4 years and older) and adults.
Administration technique - Performing intramuscular injections rapidly without
aspiration has also demonstrated a reduction in pain.
D
D-3


## p. 4 (#422) ##############################################

Appendix D
Topical analgesia may be applied to decrease pain at the injection site. These products
(e.g., 5% lidocaine-prilocaine emulsion or refrigerant spray) should be used only for the
ages recommended and as directed by the product manufacturer.
Also see:
“After the Shots” at http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4014.pdf , and
“After Receiving Vaccines” at
http://www.aimtoolkit.org/adult/After_Receiving Vaccine_D_112309%20AIM.pdf.
Following are other techniques used by some providers. There is insufficient evidence to
recommend these techniques as evidence-based strategies to relieve the pain associated with
vaccine administration.
Dual administrators – Some providers favor the technique of two individuals
simultaneously administering vaccines at separate sites. The premise is that this
procedure may decrease anxiety from anticipation of the next injection(s). There are
other healthcare personnel, some who specialize in pain management, who feel that this
technique actually increases pain since the child feels overpowered and vulnerable, with
no control. The evidence for or against this technique is insufficient to make a
recommendation for or against at this time.
Routes of administration - As of January, 2011, there are two FDA licensed vaccines
that are approved for administration by either the subcutaneous or intramuscular route
(IPV and PPSV). There is insufficient evidence to support one route more than the other
in reducing the pain associated with injection. The manufacturer's instructions should be
followed for the route of administration of any vaccine. When there is more than one
option, the number of vaccines to be administered and available injection sites may
influence the vaccinator's choice.
Infection Control
Healthcare providers should follow Standard Precautions to minimize the risks of spreading
disease during the administration of vaccines.
• Handwashing - Handwashing is critical to prevent the spread of illness and disease. Hands
should be washed thoroughly with soap and water or cleansed with an alcohol-based waterless
antiseptic before vaccine preparation, between patients, and any time hands become soiled, e.g.
diapering or cleansing excreta.
D
· Gloves - Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations do not require
gloves to be worn when administering vaccines unless the person administering the vaccine is
likely to come into contact with potentially infectious body fluids or has open lesions on the
hands. If gloves are worn, they should be changed between patients. Gloves will not prevent
needlestick injuries. Any needlestick injury should be reported immediately to the site
supervisor, with appropriate care and follow-up given as directed by local/state guidelines.
D-4


## p. 5 (#423) ##############################################

Appendix D
• Equipment Disposal - Used needles should not be recapped, cut, or detached from the
syringes before disposal. All used syringe/needle devices should be placed in puncture proof
containers to prevent accidental needlesticks and reuse. Empty or expired vaccine vials are
considered medical waste and should be disposed of according to state regulations.
Vaccine Preparation
Proper vaccine handling and preparation is critical in maintaining the integrity of the vaccine
during transfer from the manufacturer's vial to the syringe and ultimately to the patient.
• Equipment Selection
Syringe Selection - A separate needle and syringe should be used for each injection. A
parenteral vaccine may be delivered in either a 1-mL or 3-mL syringe as long as the
prescribed dosage is delivered. OSHA requires that safety-engineered injection devices (e.g.,
needle-shielding syringes or needle-free injectors) be used for injectable vaccination in all
clinical settings to reduce risk for injury and disease transmission. Personnel who will be
using these products should be involved in evaluation and selection of these products and
should receive training with these devices before using them in the clinical area.
- Needle Selection - Vaccine must reach the desired tissue site for optimal immune response
to occur. Therefore, needle selection should be based on the prescribed route, size of the
individual, volume and viscosity of the vaccine, and injection technique. A supply of needles
in varying lengths appropriate for the clinic's patient population should be available to staff.
Typically, vaccines are not highly viscous so a fine gauge needle (22-25 gauge) can be used.
- Needle-Free Injection - A new generation of needle-free vaccine delivery devices (jet
injectors) has been developed in an effort to decrease the risks of needlestick injuries to
healthcare personnel and to prevent improper reuse of syringes and needles. For more
information on needle-free injection technology, see the CDC website,
p://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaxtech/nfit/.
Inspecting Vaccine - Each vaccine and diluent vial should be carefully inspected for damage
or contamination prior to use. The expiration date printed on the vial or box should be
checked. Vaccine can be used through the last day of the month indicated by the expiration
date unless otherwise stated on the package labeling. The expiration date or time for some
vaccines changes once the vaccine vial is opened or the vaccine is reconstituted. This
information is available in the manufacturer's product information. Regardless of expiration
date, vaccine and diluent should only be used as long as they are normal in appearance and
have been stored and handled properly. Expired vaccine or diluent should never be used.
D
• Reconstitution - Several vaccines are prepared in a lyophilized (freeze-dried) form that
requires reconstitution with a liquid diluent. Vaccines should be reconstituted according to
manufacturer guidelines using only the specific diluent supplied by the manufacturer for that

chemical balance. If the wrong diluent is used, the vaccine dose is not valid and will need to
be repeated using the correct diluent.
Reconstitute vaccine just before using. Use all of the diluent supplied for a single dose and
then draw
up all of the vaccine after it is thoroughly reconstituted. Once reconstituted, the
vaccine must be either administered within the time guidelines specified in the manufacturer's
product information or discarded. Changing the needle between drawing vaccine from the vial
and administering the vaccine is not necessary unless the needle is contaminated or damaged
(see “Preparing Reconstituted Vaccine” at http://www.eziz.org/PDF/IMM-897.pdf) and
“Vaccine with Diluents: How to use them” at http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3040.pdf.
Filling Syringes - Agitate (shake) the vial to mix the vaccine thoroughly and obtain a
uniform suspension prior to withdrawing each dose. Whenever solution and container permit,
inspect vaccine visually for particulate matter and/or discoloration prior to administration. If
problems are noted (e.g., vaccine cannot be resuspended), the vaccine should not be
administered.
Standard medication preparation guidelines should be followed for drawing a dose of vaccine
into a syringe. A vaccine dose should not be drawn into the syringe until it is to be
administered. When syringes are filled, the type of vaccine, lot number, and date of filling
should be labeled on each syringe and the doses should be administered as soon as possible
after filling. Sometimes providers prefill many syringes themselves. This practice is strongly
discouraged by CDC (see Vaccine Preparation in the Storage and Handling chapter).
Single-dose vials and manufacturer-filled syringes are designed for single-dose administration
and should be discarded if vaccine has been withdrawn or reconstituted and subsequently not
used within the time frame specified by the manufacturer. Typically, the maximum time for
inactivated vaccines is no longer than the same clinic day. CDC also recommends that when
the rubber diaphragm on a single-dose vial is exposed, the vaccine in the vial should be used
that clinic day or discarded. It is difficult to tell if a needle has punctured the rubber diaphragm
and single-dose vials do not contain a preservative. The same guideline applies to
manufacturer-filled syringes that have been activated (i.e., syringe cap removed or needle
attached) because the sterile seal has been broken.
Vaccines should never be combined in a single syringe except when specifically approved by
the FDA and packaged for that specific purpose. Most combination vaccines will be combined
by the manufacturer. As of March, 2011 there are only two combination vaccines that must be
combined by the provider at the time of administration, i.e., DTaP-IPV/Hib (Pentacel) and
MCV4 (Menveo).
ID
Vaccine should never be transferred from one syringe to another. Partial doses from separate
vials should not be combined into a single dose. Both of these practices increase the risk of
contamination. Instilling air into a multidose vial prior to withdrawing a vaccine dose may not
be necessary. It could cause a “spritz" of vaccine to be lost each time the air is injected, which
through time can decrease the amount of vaccine in the vial and lead to the loss of a dose (e.g.,
obtaining only 9 full doses from a 10-dose vial).

Route and Site
The recommended route and site for each vaccine are based on clinical trials, practical
experience and theoretical considerations. This information is included in the manufacturer's
product information for each vaccine. There are four routes used in the administration of
vaccines. Deviation from the recommended route may reduce vaccine efficacy or increase local
adverse reactions.
• Oral (PO) Route - Rotavirus vaccines (RV1/Rotarix, RV5/RotaTeq) and oral typhoid
(TY21a/Vivotif) are the only U.S.-licensed vaccines that are administered by the oral route.
RV1/Rotarix requires reconstitution prior to oral administration. Oral vaccines should
generally be administered prior to administering injections or performing other procedures that
might cause discomfort. Administer the liquid slowly down one side of the inside of the cheek
(between the cheek and gum) toward the back of the infant's mouth. Care should be taken not
go far enough back to initiate the gag reflex. Never administer or spray (squirt) the vaccine
directly into the throat. Detailed information on oral delivery of these vaccines is included in
each manufacturer's product information.
to
ACIP does not recommend readministering a dose of rotavirus vaccine to an infant who
regurgitates, spits out, or vomits during or after administration. No data exist on the benefits or
risks associated with readministering a dose. The infant should receive the remaining
recommended doses of rotavirus vaccine following the routine schedule (with a 4-week
minimum interval between doses). There are no restrictions on the infant's consumption of
breast milk or any other liquid before or after administration of either of these vaccines.

Intranasal (NAS) Route - The live attenuated
influenza vaccine (LAIV, FluMist) is currently the
only vaccine administered by the nasal route. The
vaccine dose (0.2 mL) is inside a special sprayer
device. A plastic clip on the plunger divides the
dose into two equal parts. The patient should be
seated in an upright position with head tilted back.
Instruct the patient to breathe normally. The
provider should gently place a hand behind the
patient's head. The tip of the nasal sprayer should
be inserted slightly into the naris. Half of the
contents of the sprayer (0.1 mL) are sprayed into the nostril. The dose-divider clip is then
removed and the procedure is repeated in the other naris. Detailed information on the nasal
administration of LAIV is included in the manufacturer's product information. The dose does
not need to be repeated if the patient coughs, sneezes, or expels the dose in any
other
way.
D
It is possible for the LAIV spray to cause low-level contamination of the environment with
vaccine virus, but there have been no reports of vaccine virus transmission by this route. No
instances have been reported of illness or attenuated vaccine virus infections among

inadvertently exposed healthcare personnel or immunocompromised patients. Only healthcare
personnel with severe immunosuppression (i.e., who require a protective environment, such as
for hematopoietic cell transplant) should not administer LAIV. Healthcare personnel with this
level of immunosuppression would not be administering vaccines. Other healthcare personnel
at higher risk for influenza complications can administer LAIV. These include persons with
underlying medical conditions placing them at higher risk or who are likely to be at risk,
including pregnant women, persons with asthma, and persons aged 50 years and older.

polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4), are
administered by the intramuscular route.
Many inactivated vaccines contain an adjuvant,
which is a vaccine component that enhances
the immune response to the antigen.
Adjuvants can cause an exaggerated local
reaction (e.g., pain, swelling, redness) if not
injected into the muscle, so proper technique is critical.
Lynne Larson, www.biovisuals.com
There are only two routinely recommended IM sites for administration of vaccines, the
vastus lateralis muscle (anterolateral thigh) and the deltoid muscle (upper arm). Injection at
these sites reduces the chance of involving neural or vascular structures. The site depends on
the age of the individual and the degree of muscle development.

Because there are no large blood vessels in the recommended sites, aspiration before
injection of vaccines (i.e., pulling back on the syringe plunger after needle insertion but
before injection) is not necessary. A study published in Archives of Disease in Childhood in
2007 found that when a vaccine was administered and withdrawn rapidly without aspiration
there was less evidence of pain than when the vaccine was injected and withdrawn slowly
with aspiration. Also, some safety-engineered syringes do not allow for aspiration.

## p. 11 (#429) #############################################

Appendix D
Decisions on needle size and site of injection must be made for each person on the basis of
the size of the muscle, the thickness of adipose tissue at the injection site, the volume of the
material to be administered, and injection technique.
- Infants (Younger Than 12 Months)
For the majority of infants, the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is the recommended site for
injection because it provides a large muscle mass. The muscles of the buttock are not used
for administration of vaccines in infants and children because of concern about potential
injury to the sciatic nerve, which is well documented after injection of antimicrobial agents
into the buttock. If the gluteal muscle must be used, care should be taken to define the
anatomic landmarks.*
Injection technique is the most important parameter to ensure efficient intramuscular
vaccine delivery. If the subcutaneous and muscle tissue are bunched to minimize the
chance of striking bone, a 1-inch needle is required to ensure intramuscular administration
in infants aged 1 month and older. For the majority of infants, a 1-inch, 22-25-gauge needle
is sufficient to penetrate muscle in an infant's thigh. For neonates (first 28 days of life) and
preterm infants, a 5/8 inch needle usually is adequate if the skin is stretched flat between
thumb and forefinger and the needle inserted at a 90-degree angle to the skin.
*If the gluteal muscle is chosen, injection should be administered lateral and superior to a line between the
posterior superior iliac spine and the greater trochanter or in the ventrogluteal site, the center of a triangle
bounded by the anterior superior iliac spine, the tubercle of the iliac crest, and the upper border of the greater
trochanter.
- Toddlers (12 Months through 2 Years)
For toddlers, the vastus lateralis muscle in the anterolateral thigh is preferred. The needle
should be at least 1-inch long. The deltoid muscle can be used if the muscle mass is
adequate. A 5/8-inch needle is adequate only for the deltoid muscle and only if the skin is
stretched flat between thumb and forefinger and the needle inserted at a 90° angle to the
skin.
O
- Children/Adolescents (3 through 18 Years)
The deltoid muscle is preferred for children aged 3 through 18 years of age. The needle
size for deltoid injections can range from 22-25 gauge and from 5/8- to 1-inch, depending
on technique. Most young children in this age range require a 5/8- or 1-inch needle. In
general, older children and adolescents require a 1-inch needle. One study found that obese
adolescents may need a 1/2-inch needle in order to reach muscle tissue. If there is any
doubt, knowledge of body mass may be helpful in estimating the appropriate needle length.
The vastus lateralis muscle in the anterolateral thigh is an alternative site if the deltoid sites
cannot be used. A 1- or 14/4-inch needle will be sufficient to reach muscle tissue in most
older children and adolescents.
D.
- Adults (19 Years and Older)
For adults, the deltoid muscle is recommended for routine intramuscular vaccinations. The
anterolateral thigh also can be used. For men and women weighing less than 130 lbs (60
kg) a 5/8- to 1-inch needle is sufficient to ensure intramuscular injection into the deltoid

Appendix D
muscle if a 90-degree angle is used and the tissue is not bunched. For men and women
who weigh 130-152 lbs (60-70 kg), a 1-inch needle is sufficient. For women who weigh
152-200 lbs (70-90 kg) and men who weigh 152-260 lbs (70-118 kg), a 1- to 1/2-inch
needle is recommended. For women who weigh more than 200 lbs (more than 90 kg) or
men who weigh more than 260 lbs (more than 118 kg), a 1/2-inch needle is recommended.
- Technique
Follow standard medication administration guidelines for site assessment/selection and
site preparation.
To avoid injection into subcutaneous tissue, spread the skin of the selected vaccine
administration site taut between the thumb and forefinger, isolating the muscle. Another
technique, acceptable mostly for pediatric and geriatric patients, is to grasp the tissue and
"bunch up" the muscle.
- Insert the needle fully into the muscle at a 90° angle and inject the vaccine into the tissue.
Withdraw the needle and apply light pressure to the injection site for several seconds with
a dry cotton ball or gauze.

## p. 13 (#431) #############################################

Appendix D
Special Situations
Multiple Vaccinations - If multiple vaccines are administered at a single visit, administration
of each preparation at a different anatomic site is desirable. For infants and younger children,
if more than two vaccines are injected in a single limb, the thigh is the preferred site because of
the greater muscle mass. For older children and adults, the deltoid muscle can be used for
more than one intramuscular injection. The injections should be separated by 1 inch or more,
if possible, so that any local reactions can be differentiated. Vaccines that are the most reactive
(e.g., tetanus-containing and PCV) should be administered in different limbs if possible. Use
of combination vaccines can reduce the number of injections.
(See “Giving All Doses to Children Under 12 Months of Age” at
http://www.aimtoolkit.org/children/immun/9_Giving_all_doses_under_12_mths.pdf;
“Giving All Doses 12 Months of Age and Older” at
http://www.aimtoolkit.org/children/immun/10 Giving all the doses_12_mths.pdf; and
“Giving All Doses 11-12 Years of Age” at
http://www.aimtoolkit.org/adolescents/immun/GivingAllTheDoses Adolescent_RF.pdf
If a vaccine and an immune globulin preparation are administered simultaneously (e.g.,
Td/Tdap and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) or hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune
globulin (HBIG]), separate anatomic sites should be used.
The location of all injection sites should be documented in the patient's medical record.
Healthcare practices should consider using a vaccination site map so that all persons
administering vaccines routinely use the same anatomic site for each different vaccine.
· Vaccinating Persons with Bleeding Disorders - Individuals with a bleeding disorder or who
are receiving anticoagulant therapy may develop hematomas in IM injection sites. When any
intramuscularly administered vaccine is indicated for a patient with a bleeding disorder, the
vaccine should be administered intramuscularly if a physician familiar with the patient's
bleeding risk determines that the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable
safety. Prior to administration of IM vaccines the patient or family should be instructed about
the risk of hematoma formation from the injection. If the patient periodically receives
antihemophilia or similar therapy, IM vaccine administration should be scheduled shortly after
such therapy is administered. A 23-gauge or finer needle should be used and firm pressure
applied to the site for at least 2 minutes after injection. The site should not be rubbed or
massaged. Patients receiving anticoagulation therapy presumably have the same bleeding risk
as patients with clotting factor disorders and providers should follow the same guidelines for
intramuscular administration.
• Nonstandard Administration - CDC discourages deviating from the recommended route,
site, dosage, or number of doses for any vaccine. Deviation can result in reduced protection
and increase the risk of an exaggerated local reaction. For certain vaccines, the ACIP
recommends revaccination if a nonstandard route or site is used.
DE
Larger than recommended dosages can be hazardous because of excessive local or systemic
concentrations of antigens or other vaccine constituents deposited into the tissue.
D-13


## p. 14 (#432) #############################################

Appendix D
Administering volumes smaller than recommended (e.g., inappropriately divided doses) might
result in inadequate protection. Using reduced doses administered at multiple vaccination visits
that equal a full dose or using smaller divided doses is not recommended. Any vaccination
using less than the standard dose should not be counted, and the person should be revaccinated
according to age unless serologic testing indicates that an adequate response has developed.
If a partial dose of a parenteral vaccine is administered because the syringe or needle leaks or
the patient jerks away, the dose should be repeated.
Hepatitis B vaccine administered by any route other than the intramuscular route, or in adults
at any site other than the deltoid or anterolateral thigh, should not be counted as valid and
should be repeated. Doses of rabies vaccine administered in the gluteal site should not be
counted as valid doses and should be repeated. All vaccines should be administered by the
manufacturer's recommended route, but there are no ACIP recommendations to repeat doses of
other vaccines administered by another route. (See ACIP General Recommendations for more
detail).
• Managing Acute Vaccine Reactions - Severe, life-threatening anaphylactic reactions
following vaccination are rare. Thorough screening for contraindications and precautions prior
to vaccination can often prevent reactions. Staff must have in place and be familiar with
procedures for managing a reaction. Staff should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of
anaphylaxis because they usually begin within minutes of vaccination. These signs and
symptoms can include, but are not limited to: flushing, facial edema, urticaria, itching, swelling
of the mouth or throat, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Each staff member should know
their role in the event of an emergency and all vaccination providers should be certified in
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Epinephrine and equipment for maintaining an airway
should be available for immediate use. Additional drugs may also be used (see ACIP General
Recommendations, Table 8 for more detailed information). After the patient is stabilized,
arrangements should be made for immediate transfer to an emergency facility for additional
evaluation and treatment. (See “Medical Management of Vaccine Reactions in Children and
Teens” at http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3082a.pdf and “Medical Management of Vaccine
Reactions in Adult Patients” at http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3082.pdf.
Documentation
All vaccines administered should be fully documented in the patient's permanent medical record.
Healthcare providers who administer vaccines covered by the National Childhood Vaccine
Injury Act are required to ensure that the permanent medical record of the recipient indicates:
1) date of administration
2) vaccine manufacturer
3) vaccine lot number
4) name and title of the person who administered the vaccine and the address of the clinic or
facility where the permanent record will reside
5) vaccine information statement (VIS)

Best practice documentation guidelines for medications also include the vaccine type (ACIP list
of U.S. vaccine abbreviations, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/vac-abbrev.htm), route,
dosage, and site. Accurate documentation can help prevent administration errors and curtail the
number and costs of excess vaccine doses administered. Providers also should update patients'
permanent medical records to reflect any documented episodes of adverse events after
vaccination and any serologic test results related to vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., those for
rubella screening and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen). Participation in immunization
information systems is encouraged. (See additional documentation resources at
http://www.immunize.org/handouts/document-vaccines.asp ) The patient or parent/guardian
should be provided with an immunization record that includes the vaccines administered,
including the dates of administration. It is also important to document when parents refuse
vaccines. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other organizations have developed forms
to document when vaccines are refused. (See “Documenting Parental Refusal to Have Their
Children Vaccinated” at
http://www.aap.org/immunization/pediatricians/pdf/RefusaltoVaccinate.pdf)
Strategies to Prevent Administration Errors
Vaccine administration errors can result in a patient receiving an ineffective immunization. This
can leave the person vulnerable to infection. In addition to strict adherence to the “Rights of
Medication Administration” and ongoing training and education of staff, listed below are other
strategies that can be implemented to help prevent administration errors.
When possible, involve staff in the selection of vaccine products to be used in your facility.
Different brands of the same vaccine can have different schedules, age indications, or other
indications. Stocking multiple brands might lead to staff confusion and vaccine administration
errors.
Keep current reference materials available for staff on each vaccine used in your facility. Keep
reference sheets for timing and spacing, recommended sites, routes, and needle lengths posted
for easy reference in your medication preparation area.
Rotate vaccines so that those with the shortest expiration dates are in the front of the storage
unit. Use these first and frequently check the storage unit to remove any expired vaccine.
Consider the potential for product mix-ups when storing vaccines. Do not store sound-alike
and look-alike vaccines next to each other (e.g., DTaP and Tdap). Consider color coding labels
on vaccine storage containers and/or including the vaccine type and age indications.
Administer only vaccines that you have prepared for administration. Triple check your work
before you administer a vaccine and ask other staff to do the same.
D
Counsel parents and patients about vaccines to be administered and on how important it is for
them to maintain immunization records on all family members. Educated clients may notice a
potential error and help prevent it.

Medical Management of Vaccine Reactions in Children and Teens
All vaccines have the potential to cause an adverse reaction. To minimize adverse reactions, patients should be carefully
screened for precautions and contraindications before vaccine is administered. Even with careful screening, reactions
can occur. These reactions can vary from trivial and inconvenient (e.g., soreness, itching) to severe and life threatening
(e.g., (naphylaxis). If reactions occur, staff should be prepared with procedures for their management. The table below
describes procedures to follow if various reactions occur.
Reaction
Symptoms
Management
Localized
Soreness, redness, itching, or swelling at the
injection site
Apply a cold compress to the injection site. Consider
giving an analgesic (pain reliever) or antipruritic
(anti-itch) medication.
Slight bleeding
Continuous bleeding
Apply an adhesive compress over the injection site.
Place thick layer of gauze pads over site and maintain
direct and firm pressure; raise the bleeding injection
site (e.g., arm) above the level of the patient's heart.
Have patient sit or lie down for the vaccination.
Psychological Fright before injection is given

Have patient lie flat or sit with head between knees
for several minutes. Loosen any tight clothing and
maintain an open airway. Apply cool, damp cloths to
patient's face and neck.
Fall, without loss of consciousness
Examine the patient to determine if injury is present
before attempting to move the patient. Place patient
flat on back with feet elevated.
Loss of consciousness
Check the patient to determine if injury is present

Sudden or gradual onset of generalized itching, erythema (redness), or urticaria (hives); angioedema (swelling of the lips, face,
or throat); bronchospasm (wheezing); shortness of breath; shock; abdominal cramping; or cardiovascular collapse.
Treatment in Children and Teens
a. If itching and swelling are confined to the injection site where the vaccination was given, observe patient closely for the
development of generalized symptoms.
b. If symptoms are generalized, activate the emergency medical system (EMS; e.g., call 911) and notify the on-call physician.
This should be done by a second person, while the primary nurse assesses the airway, breathing, circulation, and level of
consciousness of the patient.
c. Administer aqueous epinephrine 1:1000 dilution (i.e., 1 mg/mL) intramuscularly; the standard dose is 0.01 mg/kg body
weight, up to 0.3 mg maximum single dose in children and 0.5 mg maximum in adolescents (see chart below).
d. In addition, for anaphylaxis, administer diphenhydramine either orally or by intramuscular injection; the standard dose
is 1 mg/kg body weight, up to 30 mg maximum dose in children and 100 mg maximum dose in adolescents (see
chart below).
e. Monitor the patient closely until EMS arrives. Perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), if necessary, and maintain
airway. Keep patient in supine position (flat on back) unless he or she is having breathing difficulty. If breathing is
difficult, patient's head may be elevated, provided blood pressure is adequate to prevent loss of consciousness. If blood
pressure is low, elevate legs. Monitor blood pressure and pulse every 5 minutes.
f. If EMS has not arrived and symptoms are still present, repeat dose of epinephrine every 10–20 minutes for up to 3 doses,
depending on patient's response.
g. Record all vital signs, medications administered to the patient, including the time, dosage, response, and the name of the
medical personnel who administered the medication, and other relevant clinical information.
h. Notify the patient's primary care physician.

tive formats (e.g., audio, web-video), go to: www.
immunize.org/vis/vis_sources.asp.
As healthcare professionals understand, the risks
of serious consequences following vaccination are
many hundreds or thousands of times less likely
than the risks associated with the diseases that the
vaccines protect against. Most adverse reactions
from vaccines are mild and self-limited. Serious
complications are rare, but they can have a devas-
tating effect on the recipient, family members, and
the providers involved with the care of the patient.
We must continue the efforts to make vaccines as
safe as possible.
Equally important is the need to furnish vaccine
recipients (or the parents/legal representatives of
minors) with objective information on vaccine
safety and the diseases that the vaccines protect
against, so that they are actively involved in mak-
ing decisions affecting their health or the health
of their children. When people are not informed
about vaccine adverse events, even common,
mild events, they can lose their trust in health-
care providers and vaccines. Vaccine Information
Statements (VISs) provide a standardized way to
present objective information about vaccine ben-
efits and adverse events.
Most current versions of VISS
VISs are also available for pneumococcal poly-
saccharide vaccine and shingles vaccine, as well
as various vaccines used primarily for interna-
tional travelers. The use of these VISs is recom-
mended but not currently required by federal law.
An alternative VIS—the multi-vaccine VIS-is
an option to providing single-vaccine VISs when
administering one or more of these routine birth-
through-6-month vaccines: DTP, hepatitis B,
Hib, pneumococcal (PCV), polio (IPV), or ro-
tavirus (RV). The multi-vaccine VIS can also be
used when giving combination vaccines (e.g.,
Pediarix, Pentacel, Comvax) or when giving two
or more routine vaccines at other pediatric visits
(e.g., 12–15 months, 4–6 years).
It is also acceptable to have the patient read the
VISs on an office computer or in a more perma-
nent (e.g., laminated) format during the office
visit. If this option is chosen, the patient must be
given the option to take a paper copy with them.
State or local health departments or individual pro-
viders may place the clinic name on the VISs, but
any other changes must be approved by the direc-
tor of CDC's National Center for Immunization
and Respiratory Diseases.
As of December 2010, the most recent versions of
the VISs are as follows:

What are VISs?
What to do with VISS
VISs are developed by the staff of the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
undergo intense scrutiny by panels of experts for
accuracy. Each VIS provides information to prop-
erly inform the adult vaccine recipient or the mi-
nor child's parent or legal representative about
the risks and benefits of each vaccine. VISs are
not meant to replace interactions with health-
care providers, who should answer questions and
address concerns that the recipient or the parent/le-
gal representative may have.
Some of the legal requirements concerning the
use of VISs are as follows:
1. Before an NCVIA-covered vaccine is adminis-
tered to anyone (this includes adults!), you must
give the patient or the parent/legal representa-
tive a copy of the most current VIS available for
that vaccine. Make sure you give your patient
time to read the VIS prior to the administration
of the vaccine.
2. You must record in your patient's chart the date
the VIS was given.
3. You must also record on the patient's chart the
publication date of the VIS, which appears on
the bottom of the VIS.
Use of the VIS is mandatory!
Before a healthcare provider vaccinates a child or
an adult with a dose of any vaccine containing
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, ru-
bella, polio, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Haemophilus
influenzae type b (Hib), influenza, pneumococ-
cal conjugate, meningococcal, rotavirus, human
papillomavirus (HPV), or varicella (chickenpox)
vaccine, the provider is required by the National
Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) to provide
a copy of the VIS to either the adult recipient or to
the child's parent/legal representative.
How to get VISS
“We have an obligation to provide
patients and/or parents with informa-
tion that includes both the benefits and
the risks of vaccines. This can be done
with the Vaccine Information State-
ments that healthcare providers are
required by law to provide prior to the
administration of vaccines.”
Walter A. Orenstein, MD, past director
National Immunization Program, CDC
All available VISs can be downloaded from the
website of the Immunization Action Coalition at
www.immunize.org/vis or from CDC's website
at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/default.htm.
Ready-to-copy versions may also be available
from your state or local health department.

Instructions for the Use of
Vaccine Information Statements
Required Use
1. Provide a Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) when a vaccination is given.
As required under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (42 U.S.C. $300aa-26), all health care
providers in the United States who administer, to any child or adult, any of the following vaccines -
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Haemophilus
influenzae type b (Hib), trivalent influenza, pneumococcal conjugate, meningococcal, rotavirus, human
papillomavirus (HPV), or varicella (chickenpox) - shall, prior to administration of each dose of the
vaccine, provide a copy to keep of the relevant current edition vaccine information materials that have
been produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):
to the parent or legal representative* of any child to
*”Legal representative” is defined as a parent or
whom the provider intends to administer such vaccine, other individual who is qualified under State

or oral explanations as appropriate.
rather than prior to each vaccination.
2. Record information for each VIS provided.
Health care providers shall make a notation in each patient's permanent medical record at the time
vaccine information materials are provided, indicating:
(1) the edition date of the Vaccine Information Statement distributed, and
(2) the date the VIS was provided.
This recordkeeping requirement supplements the requirement of 42 U.S.C. $300aa-25 that all health care
providers administering these vaccines must record in the patient's permanent medical record (or in a
permanent office log):
(3) the name, address and title of the individual who administers the vaccine,
(4) the date of administration, and
(5) the vaccine manufacturer and lot number of the vaccine used.
Applicability of State Law
Health care providers should consult their legal counsel
to determine additional State requirements pertaining to
immunization. The Federal requirement to provide the
vaccine information materials supplements any
applicable State laws.

Where to Get Vaccine Information Statements
1.
The Internet. All current VISs are available on the internet from two websites:
- CDC (www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/default.htm)
- The Immunization Action Coalition (www.immunize.org/vis/)
VISs from these sites can be downloaded as pdf files and printed.
2.
CDC's Immunization Works CD. This CD contains pdf files for all VIS (current as of the
date the CD was issued). Immunization Works is usually available at CDC's
immunization booth at conferences or can be ordered through CDC's online publications
order form at https://www2a.cdc.gov/nchstp_od/PlWeb/niporderform.asp.
3.
State Health Departments. CDC sends each state health department's immunization

Appendix E
Vaccine Information Statements: Frequently Asked Questions
Are VISS "informed consent" forms?
No. People sometimes use the term "informed consent" loosely when referring to
VISs.
There is no Federal requirement for informed consent. VISs are written to fulfill the
information requirements of the NCVIA. But because they cover both benefits and
risks associated with vaccinations, they provide enough information that anyone
reading them should be adequately informed. Some states have informed consent
laws. Check your state medical consent law to determine if there are any specific
informed consent requirements relating to immunization. VISs can be used for
informed consent as long as they conform to the appropriate state laws.
Should the VISs be used for adults getting vaccines as well as for children?
Yes. Under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, anyone receiving a covered
vaccine should be given the appropriate VIS. VISs are worded so they may be used
by adults as well as children. An exception is the DTP VIS, since DTaP is not
licensed for adults. There are separate VISs for adult Td and Tdap vaccines. Apart
from legal requirements, it is good practice to give the appropriate VIS every time a
vaccine is administered, to anyone of any age.
The law states that vaccine information materials be given to a child's legal
representatives. How is "legal representative" defined?
A "legal representative" is a parent or other individual who is qualified under state
law to consent to the immunization of a minor. There is not an overriding Federal
definition.
Must the patient, parent, or legal representative physically take away a
copy of each VIS, or can we simply let them read a copy and make sure
they understand it?
Ideally each VIS should be taken home. They contain information that may be
needed later (e.g., the recommended vaccine schedule, information about what to
do in the case of an adverse reaction). Patients may choose not to take the VIS,
but the provider should offer them the opportunity to do so.
When do providers have to start using a new VIS?
E
The date for a new VISs required use is announced when the final draft is published
in the Federal Register. Ideally, providers will begin using a new VIS immediately,
E-4


## p. (#447) ################################################

Appendix E
particularly if the vaccine's contraindications or adverse event profile have changed
since the previous version.
How should we comply with the law for patients who cannot read the VISS
(e.g., those who are illiterate or blind)?
The NCVIA requires providers to supplement the VISS with "visual presentations" or
oral "explanations" as needed. VISs can be read to illiterate or blind patients, or
videotapes can be used as supplements. At least one CD-ROM is being produced on
which users can hear the VIS's read. The VISs available on CDC's website are
compatible with screen reader devices.
Why are the dates on some of the VISS so old? Are they obsolete? Why
can't they be updated every year?
VISs are updated only when they need to be. For instance, a VIS would be updated
if there were a change in ACIP recommendations that affects the vaccine's adverse
event profile, indications, or contraindications. VISS posted on the NIP website are
always be the current versions. Annually changing the dates on VISs that haven't
changed otherwise could be confusing, because there would be multiple VISs in
circulation that were identical but would have different dates.
Sometimes a VIS will contain a recommendation that is at odds with the
manufacturer's package insert. Why?
VISs are based on the ACIP's recommendations, which occasionally differ from
those made by the manufacturer. These differences may involve adverse events.
Package inserts generally tend to include all adverse events that were temporally
associated with a vaccine during clinical trials, whereas ACIP tends to recognize
only those shown to be causally linked to the vaccine.
What is the reading level of VISs?
We discourage defining a VIS's readability by using traditional "grade level"
measures, which can be misleading.
Applying a Fletch-Kincaid test to a VIS usually reveals about a 10th grade reading
level. In what may be a more useful measure of readability, several VISs were the
subject of a series of focus groups among low-literacy parents in a variety of racial
and ethnic groups (some not native English speakers) in 1998, and the participants
overwhelmingly rated them easy to read and understand. Additional testing was
done in 2010, also with positive results.

Appendix E
How should we distribute VISS when the parent or legal representative of
a minor is not present at the time the vaccination is given, for example
during a school-based adolescent vaccination program?
CDC's legal advisors have proposed two alternatives for this situation:
Consent Prior to Administration of Each Dose of a Series. With this
alternative the VIS must be mailed or sent home with the student around the
time of administration of each dose. Only those children for whom a signed
consent is returned may be vaccinated. The program must place the signed
consent in the patient's medical record.
Single Signature for Series. This alternative is permissible only in those
States where a single consent to an entire vaccination series is allowed under
State law and in those schools where such a policy would be acceptable. The
first dose of vaccine may be administered only after the parent or legal
representative receives a copy of the VIS and signs and returns a statement
that a) acknowledges receipt of the VIS and provides permission for their
child to be vaccinated with the complete series of the vaccine (if possible, list
the approximate dates of future doses); and b) acknowledges their
acceptance of the following process regarding administration of additional
doses:
Prior to administration of each dose following the initial dose, a copy of the
VIS will be mailed to the parent (or legal representative) who signs the
original consent at the address they provide on this statement, or the VIS
will be sent home with the student; and
The vaccine information statements for the additional doses will be
accompanied by a statement notifying the parent that, based on their earlier
permission, the next dose will be administered to their child (state the date),
unless the parent returns a portion of this statement by mail to an address
provided, to arrive prior to the intended vaccination date, in which the parent
withdraws permission for the child to receive the remaining dose.
The program must maintain the original consent signature and any additional dose
veto statements in the patient's medical record. A record must be kept of the dates
prior to additional doses that the VIS was mailed, or sent home with the
adolescent.
Prior to administration of each additional dose, the provider should ask the
adolescent whether he/she experienced any significant adverse events following
receipt of earlier doses. If yes, the provider should consider consulting the parent
or delaying the vaccination. The adolescent's response to questions about adverse
reactions to previous doses should be kept in the medical record.

Appendix E
Questions concerning the Pediatric Multi-Vaccine VIS:
May the existing, single-vaccine VISs still be used?
Yes. The Multi-Vaccine VIS is an optional alternative to existing VISs. Providers
wishing to continue using the individual VISs may do so. These will continue to be
updated when recommendations change.
May the Multi-Vaccine VIS be used with combination vaccines, such as
Pediarix or Comvax?
Yes. Just check the appropriate boxes on the first page as you would if you were
administering the individual vaccines.
When we record the edition date of the VISs on the patient's medical
record, do we record the date on the Multi-Vaccine VIS or the dates on the
individual VISS?
Record the date of the Multi-Vaccine VIS for each vaccine given. If there is ever a
question, this will make it clear that this VIS was used, and not the individual VISS.
Can the Multi-Vaccine VIS be used for children older than 6 months, or for
adolescents or adults getting any of these vaccines?
It may be used for older children getting two or more of these vaccines during the
same visit (e.g., a 12-month old getting Hib and PCV or a 4-year old getting DTP
and IPV). It should not be used for adolescents or adults.
Can the Multi-Vaccine VIS be used for catch-up doses?
Yes, as long as the doses are given to children as part of the primary series or
routine pediatric boosters.
If a single-vaccine VIS is updated before the Multi-Vaccine VIS, may the
multi continue to be used for that vaccine?
Sometimes there can be delays in updating a VIS. If an individual VIS for a vaccine
covered on the multi gets updated before the multi does, the multi may still be
used. You may give the patient the new single VIS at the same time, or explain
verbally or with other written materials any changes. This is most important if the
changes involve contraindications or adverse events; in these cases be certain the
patient gets up-to-date information. It is less important if the update reflects other
changes, such as changes in the routine schedule.

Appendix F
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
VAERS is a national vaccine safety surveillance program co-sponsored by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VERS
collects and analyzes information from reports of adverse events following immunization. Since
1990, VAERS has received over 371,000 reports, most of which describe mild side effects such
as fever. Very rarely, people experience serious adverse events following immunization. By
monitoring such events, VAERS can help to identify important new safety concerns.
WHO? Anyone can submit a VAERS report. Most reports are sent in by vaccine manufacturers
and health care providers, but state immunization programs, vaccine recipients or their
parent/guardian, and others may also submit reports.
WHAT? VAERS encourages reporting of any clinically significant adverse event that occurs
after the administration of any vaccine licensed in the United States.
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires health care providers to report:
Any event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to subsequent doses of
the vaccine,
Any event listed in the Reportable Events Table that occurs within the specified time
period after the vaccination.
(A copy of the Reportable Events Table can be found on the following page, or obtained by
calling VAERS at 1-800-822-7967 or by downloading it from
http://vaers.hhs.gov/resources/vaersmaterialspublications.)
HOW? There are three ways to report to VAERS:
Online. Complete a VAERS online form at https://vaers.hhs.gov/esub/stepl.
Before you begin, review the Instructions for Completing the VAERS On-Line Form at
http://vaers.hhs.gov/esub/help. The VAERS On-Line form has a 20 minute limit to
complete each step, and your information will be erased if you time out. You will receive
a warning after 15 minutes. Information supplied on this form is transmitted securely to
VAERS.
- Fax. Download a VAERS form at http://vaers.hhs.gov/resources/vaers_form.pdf, or
request a form by sending an e-mail to info@vaers.org, by calling 800-822-7967, or by

Appendix F
The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)
The VICP is a no-fault alternative to the traditional tort system for resolving vaccine injury
claims. It was established as part of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, after a
rash of lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and healthcare providers threatened to cause
vaccine shortages and reduce vaccination rates.
The VICP is administered jointly by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (the Court), and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The
VICP is located in the HHS, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Healthcare
Systems Bureau, Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation.
Briefly, an individual claiming a vaccine-related injury or death files a petition for compensation
with the Court, and may be represented by an attorney. A HHS physician reviews the petition to
determine whether it meets the medical criteria for compensation. A recommendation is
provided to the Court. The HHS position is presented before a “special master," who makes the
decision for compensation under the VICP. A decision may be appealed to a judge of the Court,
then to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, and eventually to the U.S. Supreme Court.
A petitioner may file a claim in civil court against the vaccine company and/or the vaccine
administrator only after first filing a claim under the VICP and then rejecting the decision of the
Court.
Who Can File a Claim?
.
You may file a claim if you received a vaccine covered by the VICP and believe that you
have been injured by this vaccine.
You may also file a claim if you are a parent or legal guardian of a child or disabled adult
who received a vaccine covered by the VICP and believe that the person was injured by
this vaccine.
You may file a claim if you are the legal representative of the estate of a deceased person
who received a vaccine covered by the VICP and believe that the person's death resulted
from the vaccine injury.
You may file a claim if you are not a United States citizen.
Some people who receive vaccines outside of the U.S. may be eligible for compensation.
See the VICP website for more details.
In addition, to be eligible to file a claim, the effects of the person's injury must have:
1. lasted for more than 6 months after the vaccine was given; or
2. resulted in a hospital stay and surgery; or
3. resulted in death.
There is no age restriction on who may file a claim. Anyone receiving a vaccine covered by
the VICP, no matter their age, can file a claim or have one filed on their behalf.
To learn how to file a claim, see the VICP website at
http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/filing claim.htm.
F
Vaccines covered by VICP are diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Hib, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, human
papillomavirus, trivalent influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, meningococcal, polio,
pneumococcal conjugate, rotavirus, and varicella, in any combination. (Additional vaccines
may be added in the future.)

## p. (#457) ################################################

Appendix F
The Vaccine Injury Table makes it easier for some people to get compensation. The Table lists
and explains injuries and conditions that are presumed to be caused by vaccines. It also lists time
periods in which the first symptom of these injuries and conditions must occur after receiving the
vaccine. If the first symptom of these injuries/conditions occurs within the listed time periods, it
is presumed that the vaccine was the cause of the injury or condition unless another cause is
found. For example, if a patient received the tetanus vaccine and had a severe allergic reaction
(anaphylaxis) within 4 hours after receiving the vaccine, then it is presumed that the tetanus
vaccine caused the injury, if no other cause is found.
If an injury or condition is not on the Table or if it did not occur within the time period on the
Table, the petitioner must prove that the vaccine caused the injury or condition. Such proof must
be based on medical records or opinion, which may include expert witness testimony.
A copy of the Vaccine Injury Table is on the following page, or can be found online at
http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/table.htm. A comprehensive explanation of terms
used in the table accompanies the online version.

*Previously reported as measles-containing vaccine (MCV)
†No national coverage data were collected from 1986 through 1990.
ŞIn 2008, data are for PCV4+.
Combined 4-3-1: Four or more doses of DTP/DTP/DT, three or more doses of poliovirus vaccine, and one or more doses of any
measles-containing vaccine.
Combined 4-3-1-3: Four or more doses of DTP/DTP/DT, three or more doses of poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any
measles-containing vaccine, and three or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine.
Data prior to 1993 were collected by the National Health Interview Survey and represent 2-year-old children. Data from 1993
forward are from the National Immunization Survey and represent 19-35 month-old children. Different methods were used for the
two surveys.
Data are available for combinations of vaccines not reflected on this table. For more information about annual coverage figures
from 1994 to the present, see http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/stats-surv/nis/default.htm.
