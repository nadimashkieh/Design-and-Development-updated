lrnmunology and Vaccine-Preventable
Disease
Immunology is a complicated subject, and a detailed discus-
sion of it is beyond the scope of this text. However, an under-
standing of the basic function of the immune system is useful
in order to understand both how vaccines Work, and the basis
of the recommendations for their use. The description that
follows is simpliﬁed. Many excellent immunology textbooks
are available to provide additional detail.
Protection from infectious disease is referred to as
There are two basic mechanisms for acquiring
this protection — passive and active.
Passive immunity is protection by products produced by an
animal or human, and transferred to another human, usu-
ally by injection. Passive immunity often provides effective
protection, but this protection wanes (disappears) over time,
usually a few Weeks or months.
Active immunity is protection which is produced by the
person’s own immune system. This type of immunity is
generally long-lasting.
The immune system is a complex system of interacting cells
whose primary purpose is to identify foreign (“non-self”)
substances (usually live microorganisms), and develop a
defense against them. This defense is known as the immune
response, and usually involves the production of protein
molecules, called antibodies (or immunoglobulins) and
specific cells, Whose purpose is to facilitate the destruction of
the foreign substance (also known as an antigen).


## p. (#15) #################################################

PRINCIPLES OF VACCINATION m
The most effective immune responses are generally produced
in response to a live antigen. However, an antigen does not
necessarily have to be alive, as in a natural infection with a
virus or bacteria, to produce an immune response. Some
proteins, such as hepatitis B surface antigen, are easily
recognized by the immune system. Other material, such as
polysaccharide (long chains of sugar molecules which make
up the cell wall of certain bacteria) are less effective anti-
gens, and the immune response may not provide as good
protection.
An immune response is generally specific to the organism or
antigen which produced it. For example, antibodies pro-
duced in response to measles virus have no effect on rubella
or inﬂuenza viruses.
Passive immunity
Passive immunity is the transfer of antibody produced by one
human or animal to another. Passive immunity provides
protection against some infections, but this protection is
temporary. The antibodies will degrade over a period of
weeks to months and the recipient will no longer be immune.
The most common form of passive immunity is that which an
infant receives from its mother. Antibodies are transported
across the placenta during the last 1-2 months of pregnancy.
As a result, a full-term infant will have the same antibody
“profile” as its mother. These antibodies will protect the
infant from certain diseases for up to a year. Protection is
better against some diseases (e.g., measles, rubella, tetanus)
than others (e.g., polio, pertussis).
Virtually all types of blood products contain antibody. Some
products (e.g., Washed or reconstituted red blood cells) con-
tain a relatively small amount of antibody, and some (e.g.,
intravenous immune globulin and plasma products) contain
very large amounts.
Besides blood products used for transfusion (e.g., whole
blood, red cell and platelet packs) there are three major
sources of antibody used in human medicine. These are
(1) heterologous hyperimmune serum, (2) homologous pooled
human antibody (immune globulin), and (3) homologous
human hyperimmune globulin.
Heterologous hyperimmune serum is also known as anti-
toxin. This product is produced in animals, usually horses
(equine), and contains antibodies against only one antigen.
In the US, antitoxin is available for treatment of botulism
and diphtheria. A problem with this product is serum sick-
ness, a reaction to the horse protein.

J
Homologous pooled human antibody is also known as
immune globulin. It is produced by combining (pooling) the
IgG antibody fraction from thousands of adult donors in the
US. Because it comes from many different donors, it con-
tains antibody to many different antigens. It is used prima-
rily for post-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis A and measles.
Homologous human hyperimmune globulins are antibody
products which contain high titers of speciﬁc antibody.
These products are made from the donated plasma of hu-
mans with high levels of the antibody of interest. However,
since hyperimmune globulins are from humans, they also
contain other antibodies in smaller quantities.
Hyperimmune globulins are used for post-exposure prophy-
laxis for several diseases, including hepatitis B, rabies,
tetanus, and varicella.
Active immunity
Active immunity is stimulation of the immune system to
produce antigen-speciﬁc humoral (antibody) and cellular
immunity. Unlike passive immunity which is temporary,
active immunity usually lasts for many years, often for a
lifetime.
One way to acquire active immunity is to have the natural
disease. In general, once persons recover from infectious
diseases, they will be immune to those diseases for the rest
of their lives. The persistence of protection for many years
after the infection is known as immunologic memory.
Following exposure of the immune system to an antigen,
certain cells (memory B-cells) continue to circulate in the
blood (and also reside in the bone marrow) for many years.
Upon reexposure to the antigen, these memory cells begin to
replicate and produce antibody very rapidly to reestablish
protection.
Another way to produce active immunity is by administra-
tion of a vaccine. Vaccines interact with the immune system
and often produce an immune response which is identical to
that produced by the natural infection, but do not subject the
recipient to the disease or its potential complications. Vac-
cines produce immunologic memory which is similar to that
acquired by having the natural disease.
Many factors may influence the immune response to vaccina-
tion. These include the presence of maternal antibody,
nature and dose of antigen, route of administration, and the
presence of adjuvants (e.g., aluminum-containing materials
added to improve the immunogenicity of the vaccine). Host
factors such as age, nutritional factors, genetics, and coexist-
ing disease, may also affect the response.


## p. (#17) #################################################

PRINCIPLES OF VACCINATION m
Classification of Vaccines
There are only two basic types of vaccines: live attenuated
and inactivated. The characteristics of live and inactivated
vaccines are different, and these characteristics determine
how the vaccine is used.
Live attenuated vaccines are produced by modifying a
disease-producing (“wild”) virus or bacteria in a laboratory.
The resulting vaccine organism retains the ability to repli-
cate (grow) and produce immunity, but usually does not
cause illness. Live attenuated vaccines available in the
United States include live viruses and live bacteria.
Inactivated vaccines can be composed of either whole or
partial (fraction or subunits) bacteria or viruses. Toxoids
and polysaccharide vaccines are types of inactivated vac-
cines and are composed of fractions of bacterial cell wall
(polysaccharide vaccines) or bacterial toxins (toxoids).
Conjugate vaccines are those in which a polysaccharide is
chemically linked to a protein. This linkage makes the
polysaccharide a more potent vaccine.
Recombinant vaccines are produced by genetic engineering
and can be either live (oral typhoid) or inactivated
(hepatitis B).

General Rule
The more similar a vaccine is to the natural disease, the
better the immune response to the vaccine.



Live attenuated vaccines
In order to produce an immune response, live attenuated
vaccines must replicate (grow) in the vaccinated person. A
relatively small dose of virus is given, which replicates in the
body and increases to a volume large enough to stimulate an
immune response. Anything that either damages the live
organism in the vial (e.g., heat, light), or interferes with
replication of the organism (circulating antibody) can cause
the vaccine to be ineffective.
Although live attenuated vaccines replicate, they usually do
not cause disease, such as may occur with the natural
(“wild”) organism. When a live attenuated vaccine does
cause “disease,” it is usually much milder than the natural
disease, and is referred to as an adverse event.

m PRINCIPLES OF VACCINATION

K
Inactivated Vaccines
' Cannot replicate
- Minimal interference from

circulating antibody

The immune response to a live attenuated vaccine is virtu-
ally identical to that produced by a natural infection. The
immune system does not differentiate between an infection
with a weakened vaccine virus and an infection with a wild
virus.
Live attenuated vaccines may cause severe or fatal reactions
as a result of uncontrolled replication (growth) of the vaccine
virus. This only occurs in persons with immunodeﬁciency
(e.g., from leukemia, treatment with certain drugs, or HIV
infection).
A live attenuated vaccine virus could theoretically revert
back to its original pathogenic (disease-causing) form of the
organism. This is known to happen only with live polio
vaccine.
Active immunity from a live attenuated vaccine may not
develop due to interference from circulating antibody to the
vaccine virus. Antibody fromANY source (e.g., transpla-
cental, transfusion) can interfere with growth of the vac-
cine organism and lead to nonresponse to the vaccine (also
known as vaccine failure). Measles vaccine virus seems to be
most sensitive to circulating antibody. Polio vaccine virus is
least affected.
Live attenuated vaccines are labile, and can be damaged or
destroyed by heat and light. They must be handled and
stored carefully.
Currently available live attenuated vaccines include live
viruses (measles, mumps, rubella, polio, yellow fever,
vaccinia, and varicella), one live bacterial vaccine (BCG), and
one live recombinant bacterial vaccine (oral typhoid).
Inactivated vaccines
These vaccines are produced by growing the bacteria or virus
in culture media, then inactivating it with heat and-or
chemicals (usually formalin). In the case of fractional vac-
cines, the organism is further treated to purify only those
components to be included in the vaccine (e.g., the polysac-
charide capsule of pneumococcus).
Inactivated vaccines do not replicate. The entire dose of
antigen is administered in the injection.
Inactivated vaccines always require multiple doses. In
general, the ﬁrst dose does not produce protective immunity,
but only “primes” the immune system. A protective immune
response develops after the second or third dose.


## p. (#19) #################################################

PRINCIPLES OF VACCINATION
The components of inactivated vaccines are not alive. As a
result, they are noninfectious and cannot replicate. They
cannot cause disease from infection (even in an immunodeﬁ-
cient person) and cannot mutate to a pathogenic form.
Unlike live antigens, inactivated antigens are not affected
by circulating antibody. Inactivated vaccines may be given
when antibody is present in the blood (e.g., in infancy, or
following receipt of antibody-containing blood products).
In contrast to live vaccines, in which the immune response
closely resembles natural infection, the immune response to
an inactivated vaccine is mostly humoral. Little or no cellu-
lar immunity results.
Antibody titer against inactivated antigens fall over time. As
a result, some inactivated vaccines may require periodic
supplemental doses to increase, or “boost,” antibody titers.
In some cases, the antigen critical to protection against the
disease may not be defined, thus requiring the use of “whole
cell” vaccines. Whole cell bacterial vaccines are typically the
most reactogenic (i.e., cause the most adverse events). This
is because of responses to cell components that may not be
needed for protection.
Currently available inactivated vaccines include inactivated
whole viruses (inﬂuenza, polio, rabies, hepatitis A), inacti-
vated whole bacterial (pertussis, typhoid, cholera, plague),
and a variety of “fractional” vaccines, such as subunits
(hepatitis B, inﬂuenza, acellular pertussis), toxoids (diphthe-
ria, tetanus, botulinum), pure polysaccharides (pneumococ-
cal, meningococcal, Haemophilus influenzae type b), and
polysaccharide conjugates (Haemophilus influenzae type b).
Polysaccharide vaccines
Polysaccharide vaccines are a unique type of inactivated
fractional vaccine composed of long chains of sugar molecules
that make up the surface capsule of certain bacteria.
Polysaccharide vaccines are available for three diseases:
pneumococcal disease, meningococcal disease, and Haemo-
philus inﬂuenzae type b.
The immune response to a polysaccharide vaccine is typically
T-cell independent, which means that these vaccines are able
to interact with the immune system without the assistance of
T-helper cells. T-cell independent antigens, including
polysaccharide vaccines, share the following qualities:
Inconsistent immunogenicity in children <2 years of age.
Young children do not respond to polysaccharide antigens for
reasons that are not clear. It probably has to do with imma-
turity of the immune system.

- Two types of vaccines -- live attenuated
/
Repeat doses do not cause a booster response. Repeated
doses of most inactivated protein vaccines cause the antibody
titer to go progressively higher, or “boost.” This is not seen
with polysaccharide antigens.
Induced antibody has less functional activity than that
induced by protein antigens. This is because the predomi-
nant antibody produced in response to polysaccharide vac-
cines is IgM, and little IgG is produced.
In the late 1980s, it was discovered that the problems noted
above could be overcome through a process called conjuga-
tion. Conjugation changes the immune response from T-cell
independent to T-cell dependent, leading to increased immu-
nogenicity in infants and antibody booster response to mul-
tiple doses of vaccine.
See Chapter 11 on Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b (Hib) for
further information.
Recombinant vaccines
These are antigens created by genetic engineering. There
are three basic approaches to creating recombinant antigens
for vaccines.
Antigen production
Part of the gene of an organism is inserted into the gene of a
host organism. The genetically engineered host cells produce
the antigen coded by the inserted gene segment. Recombi-
nant hepatitis B is the ﬁrst vaccine to be licensed using this
technology. Pure hepatitis B surface antigen is produced in
genetically modiﬁed yeast cells.
Molecular attenuation
In this process, certain parts of the organism’s genetic code
are deleted or modified to create an organism less likely to
cause disease. Live attenuated oral typhoid is the only
vaccine currently licensed which uses this approach.
Carrier virus
In this approach, it is possible to insert a section of genetic
code from one organism into the gene of another organism,
usually a virus. The virus which receives the fragment of
gene code is called a carrier or vector. When the carrier
virus replicates (grows), it produces the foreign gene as well
as its own. There are no vaccines yet licensed using this
technology, but many are being developed, e.g., hepatitis B,
herpes, measles, and HIV.

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS m
General Recommendations
Vaccination and Vaccine Usage
This section will discuss the use of vaccines, based on the
characteristics of different types of vaccine described in the
previous section. Many of the principles of vaccine use are
described in the ACIP's 1994 General Recommendations on
Immunization (included in Appendix A).
The timing and spacing of vaccine doses are some of the most
important issues in the appropriate use of vaccines. Speciﬁc
circumstances that are commonly encountered in immuniza-
tion practice are the timing of antibody-containing blood
products and live vaccines (particularly measles vaccine),
simultaneous and nonsimultaneous administration of differ-
ent vaccines, and the intervals between subsequent doses of
the same vaccine.
Antibody-vaccine interactions

General Rule
Live attenuated vaccines are usually affected by circulating
antibody to the antigen.
Inactivated vaccines are generally not affected by
circulating antibody to the antigen.


The next table shows the interval required between adminis-
tration of a vaccine and receipt of an antibody-containing
blood product, such as immune globulin. Although immune
globulin is used in as an example in the table, the timing
would apply to any antibody-containing product.

vaccines not administered simultaneously
- Interval between subsequent doses of the
same vaccine )


## p. (#22) #################################################

E GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Since inactivated antigens are not substantially affected by
circulating antibody, they can be administered before, after,
or at the same time as the antibody. Simultaneous adminis-
tration of antibody and vaccine is recommended for
postexposure prophylaxis of certain diseases, such as
hepatitis B, rabies, and tetanus.
Live vaccines must replicate in order to cause an immune
response. Therefore, if a live vaccine must be given around
the time that antibody is given, the two must be separated
by enough time so that the antibody does not interfere with
viral replication. If MMR is given first, it is necessary to
wait at least 14 days (i.e., an incubation period) before giving
the antibody. If the interval between the vaccine and anti-
body is less than 14 days, the recipient should be tested for
immunity or the vaccine dose should be repeated.
Oral polio vaccine and yellow fever vaccine are not affected
by the administration of immune globulin or blood products.
They may be given simultaneously with blood products, or
separated by any interval. Polio virus replicates in the GI
tract, and seems to be “protected” from the effects of circulat-
ing antibody. Yellow fever vaccine is not affected because
few Americans are immune to yellow fever. Consequently,
donated blood products in the United States do not contain a
significant amount of yellow fever antibody.
If the antibody is given before a dose of MMR, it is necessary
to wait until the antibody has waned (degraded) before
giving the vaccine. In past recommendations, the interval
between receipt of antibody (immune globulin or other blood
products) has been a minimum of 6 weeks and preferably
3 months. However, a recent study suggests that this inter-
val is not always long enough to eliminate interference
between the antibody and the vaccine.
The 1994 recommendations are that the interval between an
antibody-containing product and measles vaccine varies
depending on the concentration of antibody in the product.
The table on page 21 is a summary of the suggested intervals
between various products and measles vaccine. A more
complete table (Table 8) is shown in the ACIP's 1994
General Recommendations on Immunization (included in
Appendix A).

Simultaneous and non-simultaneous administration

General Rule
There are no contraindications to simultaneous administration
of any vaccines.'
except cholera and yellow fever



The simultaneous administration of the most Widely used
live and inactivated vaccines does not result in decreased
antibody responses or increased rates of adverse reaction.
Yellow fever and cholera vaccines should not be administered
simultaneously. It has been observed that simultaneous
administration of these vaccines decreases the antibody
response to both vaccines. These vaccines should be sepa-
rated by at least 3 weeks, if possible.


## p. (#24) #################################################

E GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
When vaccines commonly associated with local or systemic
side effects (e.g., cholera, parenteral typhoid, or plague) are
given simultaneously, the side effects might be accentuated.
When feasible, it is preferable to give these vaccines on
separate occasions. This does not apply to inﬂuenza and
pertussis vaccines, which are recommended to be given
simultaneously when indicated.
Simultaneous administration of all vaccines for which a child
is eligible can be very important in childhood vaccination
programs because it increases the probability that a child
will be fully immunized at the appropriate age. A study
during a recent measles outbreak showed that about one-
third of measles cases in unvaccinated but vaccine-eligible
preschool children could have been prevented if MMR had
been administered at the same visit when another vaccine
was given.
Individual vaccines should not be mixed in the same syringe
unless they are licensed for mixing by the FDA. Only the
Connaught Hib/DTP combination vaccine has been licensed
for mixing in the same syringe.
Non-simultaneous administration of different vaccines
In some situations, vaccines which could be given simulta-
neously are not given at the same time (e.g., if the child is
receiving vaccines from two different providers).
The table below gives the suggested intervals if vaccines are
not administered simultaneously.

Timing of Live and Inactivated Vaccines







Combination Simultaneous Minimum interval
Two inactivated Yes None
Inactivated and
live Yes' None'
Two live Yes 4 weeks (none for
MMR and OPV)


'Except yellow fever and cholera vaccines.
Two inactivated vaccines that are not administered simulta-
neously can be administered at any time without a waiting
period between the vaccines.



## p. (#25) #################################################

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
If an inactivated and a live vaccine are not administered
simultaneously, they can be administered at any time with-
out a waiting period between the vaccines. The exception is
yellow fever and cholera vaccines, which should not be
administered simultaneously, and should be separated by at
least 3 weeks.
Live vaccines which are not administered simultaneously
should be separated by at least 4 weeks. This would apply to
the combination of yellow fever and MMR vaccine, or a
situation when MMR is divided into its component vaccines
(e.g., single antigen measles and mumps-rubella vaccines
should be separated by 4 weeks if not given simultaneously
as MMR). This separation of live virus vaccines is due to
theoretical concern about immunologic interference as the
viruses replicate.
This rule does not apply to oral polio and MIVIR vaccines.
Either vaccine may be administered at any time before or
after the other. There are no data which suggest that OPV
and MMR interfere with each other, even if the interval
between them is only a few days. In addition, OPV and oral
typhoid may be administered at any time before or after the
other.
Interval between doses of the same vaccine

General Rule
Increasing the interval between doses of a multi-dose vaccine
does not diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine.
Decreasing the interval between doses of a multi-dose vaccine
may interfere with antibody response and protection.



All vaccines should be administered as close to the recom-
mended schedule as possible to maximize the protection from
the vaccine. Recommended spacing between doses should be
maintained.
If a child is not up-to-date on his or her vaccinations, it may
be necessary to “accelerate” the normal schedule in order to
catch up. In this situation it is important to know how
closely the doses can be spaced and still be effective.
Another situation in which minimum spacing is important is
vaccine given in other countries. The spacing of vaccines in
other countries is frequently different from what is accept-
able in the United States. Additional details on determining
the acceptability of vaccines given in other countries are
given in the ACIP's 1994 General Recommendations on
Immunization (included in Appendix A).

## p. (#26) #################################################

m GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Doses of vaccine too close together could reduce the effective-
ness of the vaccine. The next table shows the minimum
interval acceptable between doses of vaccine. If vaccine is
given at intervals earlier than those shown below-even
1 day earlier-the second dose should not be counted.

the ﬁrst birthday.
Table 10 in the General Recommendations on Immunization (1994) is a more
complete version of the minimum spacing table.
In some cases, the interval between two doses of vaccine may
be longer than recommended. If this occurs, the next dose in
the series should be given at the next visit. It is not neces-
sary to restart the series of any vaccine due to extended
intervals between doses.
Number of doses

General Rule
Live attenuated vaccines generally produce longlasting
immunity with a single dose.
Inactivated vaccines require multiple doses and often require
periodic boosting to maintain immunity.



In the United States, all vaccines, except single-antigen
rubella and mumps vaccines, are given as a multiple-dose
series. This is done to assure that all recipients are immune
to all components of the vaccine. For instance, 95% to 98% of
recipients will respond to a single dose of measles vaccine.


## p. (#27) #################################################

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS E
The second dose is given to assure that nearly 100% of
persons are immune (i.e., the second dose is “insurance”).
For inactivated vaccines, the first dose usually does not
provide protection. A protective immune response does not
develop until the second or third close.
For inactivated vaccines, antibody titers may decrease
(“wane”) below protective levels after a few years. This
phenomenon is most notable for tetanus and diphtheria. For
these vaccines, periodic “boosting” is required, in which an
additional dose is given to raise antibody back to protective
levels.
Not all inactivated vaccines require boosting throughout life.
For example, Hib vaccine does not require boosting because
Hib disease is very rare in children older than 5 years of age.
Hepatitis B vaccine may not require boosting because of
immunologic memory to the vaccine and the long incubation
period of hepatitis B (which could produce an “autoboost”).
Adverse Events Following Vaccination

General Rule
Adverse events following live attenuated vaccines are similar to
a mild form of the natural illness
Adverse events following inactivated vaccines are mostly local
with or without fever.



In order for live vaccines to be effective, they must replicate
(grow). Adverse events are a result of infection with the
vaccine virus. Since live vaccines are derived from the
natural (“wild”) viruses, the most common adverse events are
similar to a mild form of the natural disease. For example,
measles disease is characterized by rash and fever. The most
common adverse events following measles vaccine are rash
and fever.
Adverse events following live vaccines occur after one incu-
bation period of the vaccine virus (except allergic reactions,
which occur in minutes or hours). For example, the peak
occurrence of fever and rash after measles vaccine is
7-10 days after vaccination.
Inactivated vaccines do not replicate, so adverse events are
not similar to the natural disease. Since a large amount of
antigen is given in the injection, the most common adverse
events are local at the site of the injection, such as pain,
swelling, and redness. Fever may occur, usually as a mani-
festation of inflammation at the site of injection. Local
reactions to vaccines generally increase with increasing
numbers of doses of the vaccine.

Contraindications and Precautions
- A condition in a recipient which is
likely to result in a life-threatening
problem it vaccine is administered.
\ J
(Contraindications and Precautions
Precaution
- A condition in a recipient which may
result in a life-threatening problem if
vaccine is administered OR
- May compromise the ability of the
vaccine to produce immunity.
Adverse events from inactivated vaccines generally occur
within 1-3 days of the dose of vaccine (i.e., unrelated to the
incubation period of the disease).
Reporting of Adverse Events Following
Vaccination
From 1978 to 1990, the CDC conducted the Monitoring
System for Adverse Events Following Immunization
(MSAEFI) in the public sector. In 1990, MSAEFI was re-
placed by the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System
(VAERS), which includes reporting from both public and
private sectors. Adverse events requiring medical attention
occurring within 30 days after receipt of vaccine are reported
to this system. The telephone number to call for answers to
questions and to obtain VAERS forms is (800) 822-7967.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Contraindications and precautions to vaccination generally
dictate circumstances when vaccines will not be given. Most
contraindications and precautions are temporary and the
vaccine can be given at a later time.
In general, a contraindication is a condition in a recipient
which is likely to result in a life-threatening problem if the
vaccine were given. For example, administering measles
vaccine to a person with a true anaphylactic allergy to egg
could cause serious illness or death in the recipient.
A precaution is a condition in a recipient which may result in
a life-threatening problem if the vaccine is administered, or a
condition which could compromise the ability of the vaccine
to produce immunity. In general, when a precaution is
present, a vaccine dose will not be given. However, there are
circumstances when the beneﬁt of the vaccine may outweigh
the risk, and the practitioner may choose to administer the
vaccine. For example, a hypotonic episode following a dose of
pertussis vaccine is a precaution, and additional doses are
usually not given. However, the beneﬁt of pertussis immu-
nity may outweigh the risk of another hypotonic episode if
there is a high risk of pertussis infection (e.g., during an
outbreak).

General Rule
There are only two permanent contraindication to vaccination:
severe allergy to a vaccine component or following a prior dose
of a vaccine, and encephalopathy without a known cause

occurring within 7 days of a dose of pertussis vaccine.




## p. (#29) #################################################

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
A severe allergic reaction following a dose of vaccine will
virtually always contraindicate a subsequent dose of that
vaccine. Severe allergies are those which are mediated by
IgE, occur within minutes or hours of the vaccine, and re-
quire medical attention. Examples of severe allergic reac-
tions are generalized urticaria (hives), wheezing, swelling of
the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or
shock.
Persons may be allergic to the vaccine antigen, animal
protein, antibiotics, preservatives, or stabilizers. The most
common animal protein allergen is egg protein found in
vaccines prepared using embryonated chicken eggs or
chicken embryo cell cultures (e.g., yellow fever, mumps,
measles, and inﬂuenza vaccines.) Ordinarily, persons who
are able to eat eggs or egg products safely can receive these
vaccines; persons with histories of anaphylactic or
anaphylactic-like allergy to eggs or egg proteins should not.
Asking persons whether they can eat eggs Without adverse
effects is a reasonable way to screen for those who might be
at risk from receiving measles, mumps, yellow fever, and
inﬂuenza vaccines.
Protocols have been developed for testing and vaccinating
persons with anaphylactic reactions to egg ingestion with
measles, mumps, and inﬂuenza vaccines.
Some vaccines contain trace amounts of antibiotics
(e.g., neomycin) to which patients may be hypersensitive. No
currently recommended vaccine contains penicillin or penicil-
lin derivatives.
Encephalopathy without a known cause occurring within
7 days of a dose of pertussis vaccine is an absolute
contraindication to subsequent doses of pertussis vaccine.
Refer to the pertussis chapter (Chapter 4) for more informa-
tion about encephalopathy following pertussis vaccine.
There are four vaccine contraindications which are generally
temporary — pregnancy, immunosuppression, severe illness,
and recent receipt of blood products. Live vaccines should
not be given until these conditions are resolved.

Pregnancy
The concern is with infection of the fetus, and is theoretical.
There is no evidence that any live vaccine (including rubella)
causes birth defects. See the rubella chapter (Chapter 8) for
more information. However, since the theoretical possibility
exists, live vaccines should not be given to pregnant women
(except OPV, in some situations).
Since inactivated vaccines cannot replicate, they cannot
cause fetal infection. Inactivated vaccines should be admin-
istered to women for whom they are indicated.
lmmunosuppression
Live vaccines can cause severe or fatal reactions in immuno-
suppressed persons due to uncontrolled replication of the
vaccine virus, particularly oral polio vaccine virus (and
rarely measles vaccine virus). Immunosuppressed persons
should not be given live vaccines for this reason (except
measles vaccine in HIV-infected persons -- see next section).
Inactivated vaccines cannot replicate, so are safe to use in
immunosuppressed persons. However, response to the
vaccine may be decreased.
Low-dose, short-term (less than 2 weeks), and topical (includ-
ing aerosol) courses of corticosteroids generally do not pro-
duce signiﬁcant immunosuppression, and are not contraindi-
cations for vaccination. For more information, see the
ACIP's 1993 Use of Vaccines and Immune Globulins in
Persons With Altered Immunocompetence (included in Appen-

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS a
HIV infection
Infection with human immunodeﬁciency virus is a special
circumstance. In general, the same vaccination recommen-
dations apply as with other types of immunosuppression-
inactivated vaccines are not contraindicated and live vac-
cines ARE contraindicated.
The exception is MMR vaccine. It has been observed that
measles in persons with HIV infection is often associated
with complications, including death. However, serious
adverse events have not been reported in HIV-infected
children who have received MMR vaccine. As a result, MMR
is recommended for persons with HIV infection.

vaccination of HIV-infected persons.

Severe illness
The concern is that an adverse event (particularly fever)
following vaccination could complicate the management of a
severely ill person. If a person has a severe illness, vaccina-
tion with both live and inactivated vaccines should be de-
layed until the illness has resolved.
Mild, common illnesses (such as otitis media, upper respira-
tory infections, colds, and diarrhea) are NOT contraindica-
tions to vaccination.

. Findings not replicated by multiple prior and
subsequent studies.
K-No evidence of increased adverse events. j
Recent blood products
Blood products may interfere with the replication of live
viruses. Recent receipt of blood products is a precaution to
MMR vaccine. OPV and oral typhoid are not affected by
circulating antibody, and blood products in the United States
do not contain enough yellow fever antibody to interfere with
replication of that vaccine.
MMR vaccine should be given 14 days prior to the blood
product, or delayed until the antibody has degraded (see
Table 8 in the ACIP's 1994 General Recommendations on
Immunization, included in Appendix A). If MMR is given
sooner than the minimum interval shown, the recipient
should be tested for immunity or the dose repeated after the
appropriate interval.
Inactivated vaccines are not substantially affected by circu-
lating antibody from blood products and are not
contraindicated.
Invalid Contraindications to Vaccination
Some health care providers inappropriately consider certain
conditions or circumstances to be true contraindications or
precautions to vaccinations. Such conditions or circum-
stances are known as invalid contraindications, and result in
missed opportunities to administer needed vaccines. Some of
the most common invalid contraindications are minor ill-
nesses, conditions related to pregnancy and breast-feeding,
allergies which are not anaphylactic in nature, and certain
aspects of the patient's family history.
Minor illness
Children with mild acute illnesses, such as low-grade fever,
upper respiratory infection, colds, otitis media, and mild
diarrhea, can and should be vaccinated.
Several large studies have shown that young children with
URI, otitis media, diarrhea,W and-or fever respond to
measles vaccine as well as those without these conditions.
These large studies refute the results of an earlier small
study (Krober, JAMA 1991) which suggested that minor
infections such as URIs might impair the response to
measles vaccine. Further, there is no evidence that mild
diarrhea reduces the success of polio immunization of infants
in this country.


## p. (#33) #################################################

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Low-grade fever is not a contraindication to immunization.
Temperature measurement is not necessary before immuni-
zation if the infant or child does not appear ill, does not feel
hot to the touch, and the parent does not say he or she is
currently ill.
Antibiotic therapy
Antibiotics do not have an effect on the immune response to
a vaccine. No commonly used antibiotic or antiviral will
inactivate a live virus vaccine.
Disease exposure or con valescence
If a child is not severely ill, he or she should be vaccinated.
There is no evidence that either disease exposure or conva-
lescence will affect the response to a vaccine or increase the
likelihood of an adverse event.
Pregnancy in the househoId—breast-feeding
All vaccines, including live vaccines (MMR, OPV, and yellow
fever) can be given to infants or children with pregnant
household contacts, as well as to breast-feeding infants.
Measles and mumps vaccine viruses produce a noncommuni-
cable infection, and are not transmitted to household con-
tacts. Rubella vaccine virus has been shown to be shed in
breast milk, but transmission to an infant has rarely been
documented (rubella is not transmitted by mouth). Oral
polio vaccine virus is shed and can spread, but pregnant
contacts are at no greater risk than other household contacts
in this situation, and OPV has not been shown to cause fetal
defects.
Breast-feeding does not decrease the response to routine
childhood vaccines, including OPV. Breast-feeding also does
not extend or improve passive immunity to vaccine-prevent-
able disease provided by maternal antibody.
Premature birth
Vaccines should be started on schedule based on the child’s
chronological age. Premature infants have been shown to
respond adequately to vaccines used in infancy.
If a premature infant is still hospitalized, OPV should gener-
ally not be used. This could lead to contact transmission of
OPV to other high-risk infants.
Routine hepatitis B vaccination should not be given until an
infant weighs 2 kilograms or more. Infants born to women
who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive (from acute or
chronic infection) should be vaccinated and given hepatitis B


## p. (#34) #################################################

E GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
immune globulin regardless of body weight. See Chapter 10
for more information on the prevention of perinatal trans-
mission of hepatitis B virus.
Nonspecific allergies, allergies to antibiotics not in
vaccine, non-severe egg allergies, and allergies to
duck antigens
Infants and children with non-specific allergies, duck or
feather allergy, allergy to penicillin, relatives with allergies,
and children taking allergy shots can and should be immu-
nized. No vaccine available in the United States contains
duck antigen or penicillin.
Non-anaphylactic allergy to vaccine component
Anaphylactic allergy to a vaccine component (such as egg or
neomycin) is a true contraindication to vaccination. See
pages 26-27 for more details. Non-anaphylactic allergy to a
vaccine constituent is not a contraindication to that vaccine.
Family history of adverse events unrelated to immuno-
suppression, or family history of seizures or SIDS
The only family history that is relevant in the decision to
vaccinate a child is immunosuppression, and only for oral
polio virus vaccine. OPV should not be given to a child with
a personal or family history of immunosuppression, because
the vaccine virus could spread to the immunosuppressed
contact.
Need or requirement for tuberculosis skin test (PPD)
Infants and children who need TB skin tests can and should
be immunized. All vaccines, including MMR, can be given on
the same day as a TB skin test, or any time after a TB skin
test is applied. For most vaccines, there are no TB skin test
timing restrictions at all.
MMR vaccine may decrease the response to a TB skin test,
potentially causing a false negative response in someone who
actually has an infection with tuberculosis. MMR can be
given the same day as a TB skin test. If MMR has been
given and one or more days have elapsed, in most situations
it is recommended to wait 4-6 weeks before giving a routine
TB skin test.


## p. (#35) #################################################

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Missed Opportunities to Vaccinate
During 1989-1991, the United States experienced a major
resurgence of measles. This resurgence was characterized by
a shift in the age distribution of measles from predominantly
school-aged to predominantly preschool-aged children, and
the occurrence of very large (> 1000 cases) measles outbreaks
among unvaccinated preschool-aged children living in large
urban areas.
The primary cause of this resurgence of measles was inad-
equate measles vaccination levels among preschool-aged
children.
There are many causes of low vaccination levels among
preschool-aged children, including barriers to vaccination
(limited hours, vaccination fees, inconvenient clinic loca-
tions), and insufﬁcient personnel to deliver vaccination
services. However, one of the most important causes of low
vaccination levels is missed opportunities for vaccination.

Definition of a missed opportunity for vaccination:
A child in need of immunization seeks health care but receives either no
immunizations or does not receive all the needed immunizations.


There are three general types of missed opportunities.
Child seeks immunization, and simultaneous vaccination is
not offered, invalid contraindications are invoked, and/or
bureaucratic obstacles prevent access to immunization
services (e.g., fees, appointment requirements).
Child seeks other health care services (emergency depart-
ments, hospital outpatient departments) and immunization
status is not assessed or vaccination offered. Missed oppor-
tunities for vaccination can be reduced by assessing vaccina-
tion status at ALL health care visits, not just those for vacci-
nation services. Emergency departments and visits for
AFDC and WIC are settings where children could be
screened and vaccinated.
Child is enrolled in an assistance program and is not
vaccinated. Children enrolled in assistance programs may
be underimmunized as a result of ﬁnancial, access, or other
barriers. Visits to services such as WIC and AFDC are
excellent opportunities to review the immunization record
and either vaccinate or refer the child for needed vaccines.

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS



OPV Exception
Why oral polio vaccine is an exception to the rules
Multiple doses
0 Vaccine contains 3 viruses which may interfere
with each other
Primary series in infancy (antibody interference)
- Replicates In GI tract, minimum interference
with circulating antibody.
Use in pregnancy
0 No evidence of effect on fetus

/


The most important, immediately implemented actions for
reducing missed opportunities for vaccination are the use of
simultaneous administration and elimination of invalid
contraindications to vaccination.
Many studies have documented that the elimination of
invalid contraindications and simultaneous administration of
vaccines can raise vaccination levels of 2-year-old children by
10%-15%.
The Special Case of Oral Polio Vaccine
Live oral polio vaccine is an exception to several of the gen-
eral rules described in previous sections.
Multiple doses
Unlike other live attenuated vaccines, OPV requires a series
of three doses in the primary series, with a supplementary
(“insurance”) dose at school entry. This is because there are
three types of poliovirus in the vaccine that may interfere
with each other while replicating. Multiple doses are given
in order to assure that all recipients are immune to all three
viruses.
Primary series in infancy (antibody interference)
OPV is a live vaccine, yet the series is begun in infancy when
the child presumably has maternal antibody. However, this
maternal antibody does not appear to substantially interfere
with replication of the vaccine viruses. This is probably
because OPV replication occurs in the gastrointestinal tract
where it is relatively protected from the effects of circulating
antibody.
Use in pregnancy
OPV is recommended for use in pregnant women if there is
time for only one dose of vaccine before exposure to wild
virus. This is because OPV produces gastrointestinal immu-
nity (important for protection from wild virus), and there is
no evidence of any adverse effect of OPV on the developing
fetus.

Chapter
Diphtheria
IPHTHERIA IS AN ACUTE, TOXIN-MEDIATED DISEASE
D caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The name
of the disease is derived from the Greek diphtheria,
meaning leather hide. The disease was described in the 5th
Century BC. by Hippocrates, and epidemics were described
in the 6th Century BC. by Aetius. The bacterium was ﬁrst
observed in diphtheritic membranes by Klebs in 1883 and
cultivated by Lofﬂer in 1884. Antitoxin was invented in late
19th century, and toxoid was developed in the 1920s.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae
C. diphtheriae is an aerobic gram-positive bacillus. Toxin-
production (toxigenicity) occurs only when the bacillus is
itself infected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacterio-
phage) carrying the genetic information for the toxin (tox
gene), converting a non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae to toxigenic.
Only toxigenic strains can cause severe disease.
Culture of the organism requires selective media containing
tellurite. If isolated, the organism must be distinguished in
the laboratory from other Corynebacterium species that
normally inhabit the nasopharynx (e.g., diphtheroids).
There are three biotypes — gravis, intermedius, and mitis.
The most severe disease is associated with the gravis bio-
type, but any strain may produce toxin. All isolates of
C. diphtheriae should also be tested by the laboratory for
toxigenicity.
Pathogenesis
Susceptible persons may acquire toxigenic diphtheria bacilli
in the nasopharynx. The organism produces a toxin which
inhibits cellular protein synthesis and is responsible for local
tissue destruction and membrane formation. The toxin
produced at the site of the membrane is absorbed into the
bloodstream and then distributed to the tissues of the body.

m DIPHTHERIA




Diphtheria \
Clinical Features
' Incubation period 2-5 days (range, 1-10 days)
- May involve any mucous membrane
. Classified based on site of infection:
- Anterior nasal
- Tonsillar and pharyngeal
- Laryngeal
- Cutaneous
- Ocular
\ - Genital J
Diphtheria
Pharyngeal and Tonsillar Disease
- Insidious onset of exudative pharyngitis
o Exudate spreads over 2-3 days and may form
membrane
- Membrane adherent to pharynx and may cause
respiratory obstruction
o Fever usually not high but patient appears toxic


The toxin is responsible for the major complications of myo-
carditis and neuritis and can also cause low platelet counts
(thrombocytopenia) and protein in the urine (proteinuria).
Clinical disease associated with non-toxin-producing strains
is generally milder. While rare severe cases have been re-
ported, these may actually have been caused by toxigenic
strains which were not detected due to inadequate culture
sampling.
Clinical Features
The incubation period of diphtheria is 2-5 days (range, l-lO
days).
Disease can involve almost any mucous membrane. How-
ever, for clinical purposes, it is convenient to classify diph-
theria into a number of manifestations, depending on the site
of disease.
Anterior nasal diphtheria
The onset is indistinguishable from that of the common cold
and is usually characterized by a mucopurulent nasal dis-
charge (containing both mucus and pus) which may become
blood-tinged. A white membrane usually forms on the nasal
septum. The disease is usually fairly mild because of appar-
ent poor systemic absorption of toxin in this location, and can
be terminated rapidly by antitoxin and antibiotic therapy.
Pharyngeal and tonsillar diphtheria
The most common sites of infection are the tonsils and the
pharynx. Infection at these sites is usually associated with
substantial systemic absorption of toxin. The onset of
pharyngitis is insidious. Early symptoms include malaise,
sore throat, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Within 2-3 days,
a bluish-white membrane forms and extends, varying in size
from covering a small patch on the tonsils to covering most of
the soft palate. Often by the time a physician is contacted,
the membrane is greyish-green in color, or black if there has
been bleeding. There is a minimal amount of mucosal
erythema surrounding the membrane. The membrane is
adherent to the tissue, and forcible attempts to remove it
cause bleeding. Extensive membrane formation may result
in respiratory obstruction.


## p. (#39) #################################################

DIPHIHERIA
The patient may recover at this point; or if enough toxin is
absorbed, develop severe prostration, striking pallor, rapid
pulse, stupor, coma, and may even die within 6 to 10 days.
Fever is usually not high, even though the patient may
appear quite toxic. Patients with severe disease may develop
marked edema of the submandibular areas and the anterior
neck along with lymphadenopathy, giving a characteristic
“bullneck” appearance.
Laryngeal diphtheria
Laryngeal diphtheria can be either an extension of the
pharyngeal form or the only site involved. Symptoms in-
clude fever, hoarseness, and a barking cough. The mem-
brane can lead to airway obstruction, coma, and death.
Cutaneous (skin) diphtheria
In the United States, cutaneous diphtheria has been most
often associated with homeless (“skid row”) persons. Skin
infections are quite common in the tropics and are probably
responsible for the high levels of natural immunity found in
these populations. Skin infections may be manifested by a
scaling rash or by ulcers with clearly demarcated edges and
membrane, but any chronic skin lesion may harbor
C. diphtheriae, along with other organisms. Generally, the
organisms isolated from recent cases in the United States
were non-toxigenic. In general, the severity of the skin
disease with toxigenic strains appears to be less than in
other forms of infection with toxigenic strains. Skin diseases
associated with nontoxigenic strains are no longer reported
to the National Notiﬁable Diseases Surveillance System in
the United States.
Other sites of involvement include the mucous membranes
of the conjunctiva and vulvo-vaginal area, as well as the
external auditory canal.
Complications
Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are attrib-
utable to effects of the toxin. The severity of the disease and
complications are generally related to the extent of local
disease. The toxin, when absorbed, affects organs and tis-
sues distant from the site of invasion. The most frequent
complications of diphtheria are:
Myocarditis
Abnormal cardiac rhythms can occur early in the course of
the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. If
myocarditis occurs early, it is often fatal.

## p. (#40) #################################################

m
Neuritis
This complication most often affects motor nerves and usu-
ally clears completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is most
frequent during the third week of illness. Eye muscles,
limbs, and diaphragm paralysis can occur after the ﬁfth
week. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure may
result from diaphragmatic paralysis.
Other complications include otitis media and respiratory
insufﬁciency due to airway obstruction, especially in infants.
Death
The overall case-fatality rate for diphtheria is 5%-10%, with
higher death rates (up to 20%) in persons <5 and >40 years
of age. The case-fatality rate for diphtheria has changed
very little during the last 50 years.
Differential Diagnosis
Nasal diphtheria
A foreign body should be ruled out.
TonsiIIar/pharyngeal diphtheria
Differential diagnosis includes streptococcal membranous
infection, infectious mononucleosis and other viral infections,
thrush (yeast infection), and post-tonsillectomy membrane.
Laryngeal diphtheria
Consider croup and foreign body.
Clues to the diagnosis of diphtheria include extension of
membrane beyond the tonsils and bleeding when the mem-
brane attachment is removed.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Diagnosis is usually made based on the clinical presentation
since it is imperative to begin presumptive therapy quickly.
Culture of the lesion is done to confirm the diagnosis. It is
critical to take a swab of the pharyngeal area, especially any
discolored areas, ulcerations, and tonsillar crypts. Culture
medium containing tellurite is preferred because it provides
a selective advantage for the growth of this organism. A
blood agar plate is also inoculated for the detection of
hemolytic streptococcus. If diphtheria bacilli are isolated,
they must be tested for toxin production.


## p. (#41) #################################################

DIPHTHERIA a
Gram stain and Kenyon stain of material from the mem-
brane itself can be helpful when trying to conﬁrm the clinical
diagnosis. The Gram stain may show multiple club-shaped
forms which look like Chinese characters. Other Corynebac-
terium species (“diphtheroids”) that can normally inhabit the
throat may confuse the interpretation of direct stain. How-
ever, treatment should be started if clinical diphtheria is
suggested, even in the absence of a diagnostic Gram stain.
In the event that prior antibiotic therapy may have impeded
a positive culture in a suspect diphtheria case, two sources of
evidence may aid in presumptive diagnosis: (1) isolation of
the C. diphtheriae from culturing of close contacts, and-or
(2) a low non-protective diphtheria antibody titer in sera
obtained prior to antitoxin administration (<0.1 I.U). This is
done by commercial laboratories and requires several days.
To isolate C. diphtheriae from carriers, it is best to inoculate
a Lofﬂer’s or Pai’s slant with the throat swab. After an
incubation period of 18-24 hours, growth from the slant is
used to inoculate a medium containing tellurite.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Diphtheria occurs worldwide, but clinical cases are more
prevalent in temperate zones. In the United States during
the pretoxoid era, the highest incidence was in the Southeast
during the winter. More recently, highest incidence rates
have been in states with signiﬁcant populations of Native
Americans. No geographic concentration of cases is cur-
rently observed in the United States.
Reservoir
Human carriers are usually asymptomatic. In outbreaks,
high percentages of children are found to be transient
carriers.
Transmission
Transmission is most often person-to-person spread from the
respiratory tract. Rarely, transmission may occur from skin
lesions or articles soiled with discharges from lesions of
infected persons (fomites).

Temporal pattern
In temperate areas, diphtheria most frequently occurs dur-
ing colder months (winter and spring).
Communicability
Transmission may occur as long as virulent bacilli are
present in discharges and lesions. The time is variable, but
organisms usually persist 2 weeks or less, and seldom more
than 4 weeks, without antibiotics. Chronic carriers may
shed organisms for 6 months or more. Effective antibiotic
therapy promptly terminates shedding.
Secular Trends in the United States
Diphtheria was once a major cause of morbidity and mortal-
ity among children. In England and Wales during the 1930s,
diphtheria was among the top three causes of death for
children <15 years of age.
In the 1920s in the United States, 100,000-200,000 cases of
diphtheria (140-150 cases per 100,000 population) and
13,000-15,000 deaths were reported each year. In 1921, a
total of 206,000 cases and 15,520 deaths were reported. The
number of cases gradually fell to about 19,000 cases in 1945
(15 per 100,000 population). A more rapid decrease began
with the widespread use of toxoid in the late 1940s.
From 1970 to 1979, an average of 196 cases per year were
reported. This included a high proportion of cutaneous cases
from an outbreak in Washington state. Beginning in 1980,
all cases with non-toxigenic cutaneous isolates were excluded
from reporting. Diphtheria was seen most frequently in
Native Americans and persons in lower socioeconomic strata.
From 1980 through 1993, only 40 cases of diphtheria were
reported in the United States, an average of 3 per year
(range, 0-5 cases per year). No cases were reported in 1993.
All cases reported in 1980-1993 were respiratory disease.
Twenty-seven (67%) cases reported in 1980-1994 were in
persons >20 years of age; 45% of cases were among persons
>40 years of age. Most cases have occurred in unimmunized
or inadequately immunized persons. The current age distri-
bution of cases corroborates the ﬁnding of inadequate levels
of circulating antitoxin in many adults (up to 60% with less
than protective levels).
The current rarity of diphtheria in the United States is due
primarily to the high levels of adequate immunization of
children (95% of children entering school have received a
primary series) and to an apparent reduction in the circula-
tion of toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae.

DIPHTHERIA m
An outbreak began in the Russian Federation in the late
1980s which has continued into the early 1990s, with more
than 15,000 cases reported in 1993. The outbreak has spread
to several other countries of the former Soviet Union, espe-
cially the Ukraine. Low vaccination coverage is thought to
be an important factor in the resurgence of diphtheria in
Russia. Many cases have been reported in young adults.
Treatment of Diphtheria
Diphtheria antitoxin
Diphtheria antitoxin, produced in horses, was ﬁrst used in
the United States in 1891. It is no longer indicated for
prophylaxis of contacts of diphtheria cases, only for the
treatment of diphtheria.
Antitoxin will not neutralize toxin that is already ﬁxed to
tissues, but will neutralize circulating (unbound) toxin and
will prevent progression of disease. The patient must be
tested for sensitivity before antitoxin is given. Antitoxin
should be obtained from the nearest Quarantine Station or
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (404) 639-
8255 during ofﬁce hours. After hours, call the CDC operator
at (404) 639-3311.
Persons with suspected diphtheria should be given antibiot-
ics and antitoxin in adequate dosage and placed in isolation
after the provisional clinical diagnosis is made and appropri-
ate cultures are obtained. Respiratory support and airway
maintenance should also be administered as needed.

contagious 48 hours after antibiotics are instituted. Elimina-
tion of the organism should be documented by two consecu-
tive negative cultures after therapy is completed.
Preventive measures
For close contacts, especially household contacts, a
diphtheria toxoid booster, appropriate for age, should be
given. Contacts should additionally receive antibiotics —
benzathine penicillin G (600,000 units for persons less than
6 years old and 1,200,000 units for those 6 years old and I
older) or a 7- to 10-day course of oral erythromycin,
(40 mg-kg-day for children and 1 g-day for adults). For
compliance reasons, if surveillance of contacts cannot be
maintained, they should receive benzathine penicillin G.
Identified carriers in the community should also receive
antibiotics. Maintain close surveillance and begin antitoxin
at the ﬁrst signs of illness.
Contacts of cutaneous diphtheria should be handled as
above; however, if the strain is shown to be nontoxigenic,
investigation of contacts can be discontinued.
Diphtheria Toxoid
Beginning in the early 1900s, prophylaxis was attempted
with toxin-antitoxin mixtures. Toxoid was developed around
1921, but was not widely used until the early 1930s. It was
incorporated with tetanus toxoid and pertussis vaccine and
became routinely used in the 1940s.
Diphtheria toxoid is produced by growing C. diphtheriae in
liquid medium. The filtrate is incubated with formaldehyde
to convert toxin to toxoid. It is adsorbed onto an aluminum
salt and preserved with thimerosal.
The usual schedule is a primary series of three or four doses
with a booster dose. Because of waning antitoxin titers, most
individuals have antitoxin levels below optimal levels 10
years after the last dose. As a result, additional booster
doses are required every 10 years to maintain antitoxin
levels.
After a primary series of three properly spaced diphtheria
toxoid doses in adults or four doses in infants, a protective
level of antitoxin (deﬁned as >01 international units of
antitoxin-ml) is reached in over 95%. Diphtheria toxoid has
been estimated to have a clinical efficacy of 97%.

Routine vaccination
DTP is the vaccine of choice for children 6 weeks through
6 years of age (up to the 7th birthday. See table below).
DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis) can be used
for the fourth and ﬁfth doses, and is preferred, if available.
DTaP is licensed for use only in children 15 months to
6 years of age. If a child has a valid contraindication to
pertussis vaccine, DT should be used to complete the series.
The ﬁrst, second and third doses of DTP should be separated
by a minimum of 4 weeks.

iEither whole-cell DTP or DTaP can be used for the fourth and fifth doses; DTaP is generally
preferred, if available. If DTaP is used for the fourth dose, it should be administered at 15 months
of age.
Td is the vaccine of choice for children 7 years old and older
and adults (see next table). A primary series is three doses.
The ﬁrst two doses should be separated by at least 4 weeks,
and the third dose given 6 months after the second.
Interrupting the recommended schedule or delaying subse-
quent doses does not reduce the ultimate immunity. There is
no need to restart a series regardless of the time elapsed
between doses.
Tetanus toxoid should be given with diphtheria toxoid as Td
every 10 years. If a dose is given sooner as part of wound
management, the next booster is not needed for 10 years
thereafter. More frequent boosters are not indicated and
have been reported to result in an increased incidence and
severity of adverse reactions.

Individuals recovering from diphtheria
Infection may not confer immunity. As a result, active
immunization with diphtheria toxoid should be initiated or
completed during convalescence. This is less of a concern
than with tetanus.
Adverse Events Following Vaccination
Local reactions, generally erythema and induration with or
without tenderness, are common after the administration of
vaccines containing diphtheria antigen. They are usually
self-limited and require no therapy. A nodule may be pal-
pable at the injection site for several weeks. Abscess at the
site of injection has been reported. Fever and other systemic
symptoms are uncommon.
Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions, characterized by
severe local reactions, may occur, particularly in persons who
have had multiple prior boosters. These reactions are a
result of high circulating levels of diphtheria antitoxin.
Arthus reactions do not contraindicate subsequent doses of
diphtheria toxoid, but the recommended spacing between
booster doses should be maintained.
Rarely, severe systemic reactions such as generalized
urticaria, anaphylaxis, or neurologic complications have been
reported by those receiving diphtheria toxoid.
Contraindications to Vaccination
Persons with a history of neurologic or severe allergic reac-
tion to a vaccine or following a previous dose should not
receive additional doses of diphtheria toxoid. Diphtheria
toxoid should be deferred for those individuals who have
moderate to severe febrile illness, but persons with mild
illness may be vaccinated. Immunosuppression is not a
contraindication to diphtheria toxoid.

Vaccine Storage and Handling
The vaccine may be shipped without refrigeration if deliver-
able in 4 days. Refrigerant may be used. It should be refrig-
erated immediately upon arrival and stored at a temperature
of 2°-8°C (35°-46°F). It should not be frozen — this reduces
potency, and it should not be stored in direct contact with
refrigerant.
Suspect Case investigation and Control
Immediate action on all highly suspect cases (including
cutaneous) is warranted until shown not to be toxigenic
C. diphtheriae. The following action should also be taken for
any toxigenic C. diphtheriae carriers who are detected.
1. Contact state health department or CDC.
2. Obtain appropriate cultures and preliminary clinical and
epidemiological information (including vaccine history).
3. Begin early presumptive treatment with antibiotics and
antitoxin.
a. Start antibiotics and antitoxin.
b. Impose strict isolation until at least two cultures are
negative 24 hours after antibiotics were stopped.
4. Identify close contacts, especially household members
and other persons directly exposed to oral secretions of
the patient.
a. Culture all close contacts, regardless of their immuni-
zation status. Ideally, culture should be from both
throat and nasal swabs. After culture, all contacts
should receive antibiotic prophylaxis.
b. Inadequately immunized contacts should receive DTP
DTaP-DT-Td boosters. If less than three doses of diph-
theria toxoid have been given, or vaccination history is
unknown, an immediate dose of diphtheria toxoid
should be given and the primary series completed ac-
cording to the current schedule. If >5 years have
elapsed since administration of diphtheria toxoid-con-
taining vaccine, a booster dose should be given. If the
most recent dose was within 5 years, no booster is re-
quired (see the ACIP's 1991 Diphtheria, Tetanus, and
Pertussis: Recommendations for Vaccine Use and Other
Preventive Measures for schedule for children <7 years of
age.)

Tetanus
by an exotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. It is
characterized by generalized increased rigidity and
convulsive spasms of skeletal muscles. The muscle stiffness
usually involves the jaw (lockjaw) and neckﬁrst and later
becomes generalized.
TETANUS IS AN ACUTE, OFTEN FATAL, DISEASE CAUSED
Although records from antiquity (5th century BC.) contain
clinical descriptions of tetanus, it was Carle and Rattone who
ﬁrst produced tetanus in animals by injecting them with pus
from a fatal human tetanus case in 1884. During the same
year, Nicolaier produced tetanus in animals by injecting
them with samples of soil. In 1889, Kitasato isolated the
organism from a human victim, showed that it produced
disease when injected into animals, and reported that the
toxin could be neutralized by speciﬁc antibodies. In 1897,
Nocard demonstrated the protective effect of passively trans-
ferred antitoxin, and passive immunization in humans was
used during World War I. Tetanus toxoid was described by
Descombey in 1924, and the effectiveness of active immuni-
zation was demonstrated in World War II.
Clostridium tetani
C. tetani is a slender, gram-positive, anaerobic rod that may
develop a terminal spore, giving it a drumstick appearance.
The organism is sensitive to heat and cannot survive in the
presence of oxygen. The spores, in contrast, are very resis-
tant to heat and the usual antiseptics. They can survive
autoclaving at 121° C for 10-15 minutes. The spores are also
relatively resistant to phenol and other chemical agents.
The bacilli are widely distributed in soil and street dust, and
in the intestines and feces of horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats,
rats, guinea pigs, and chickens. Manure-treated soil may be
highly infections. In agricultural areas, a signiﬁcant number
of normal human adults may harbor the organism. The
spores can also be found on skin surfaces and in contami-
nated heroin.

Pathogenesis
The portal of entry of the bacilli is almost always the site of
minor or major puncture wounds or scratches (hand, foot, or
leg). In the presence of dead tissue and perhaps other organ-
isms, the spores germinate. Toxins, including tetanospasmin,
are produced, and disseminated via blood and lymphatics.
Toxins act at several sites within the central nervous system,
including peripheral motor end plates, spinal cord, brain,
and sympathetic nervous system. The typical clinical mani-
festations of tetanus are caused by the interference with
neurotransmitter release to block inhibitor impulses. This
leads to unopposed muscle contraction and spasm. Seizures
may occur, and the autonomic nervous system may also be
affected.
Clinical Features
Incubation period
The incubation period varies from 3 days to 3 weeks, usually
8 days. The further the injury site is from the central ner-
vous system, the longer the incubation period. The shorter
the incubation period, the higher the chance of death. In
neonatal tetanus, symptoms usually appear from 4 to 14
days after birth, averaging about 7 days.
On the basis of clinical ﬁndings, three different forms of
tetanus have been described.
Local tetanus
Local tetanus is an uncommon form of the disease, in which
patients have persistent contraction of muscles in the same
anatomic area as the injury preceding the tetanus. These
contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually
subsiding. Local tetanus may precede the onset of general-
ized tetanus, but is generally milder. Only about 1% of cases
are fatal.
Cephalic tetanus
Cephalic tetanus is a rare form of the disease, occasionally
occurring with otitis media (ear infections) in which C. tetani
is present in the ﬂora of the middle ear, or following injuries
to the head. There is involvement of the cranial nerves,
especially in the facial area.


## p. (#51) #################################################

Generalized tetanus
At least 80% of reported cases of tetanus are generalized; as
a rule, in a descending pattern. The ﬁrst sign is trismus or
lockjaw, followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swal-
lowing, and rigidity of abdominal muscles. Other symptoms
include a temperature rise of 2°-4°C above normal, sweating,
elevated blood pressure, and episodic rapid heart rate.
Spasms may occur frequently and last for several minutes.
Spasms continue for 3-4 weeks. Complete recovery may take
months.
Neonatal tetanus is a form of generalized tetanus which
occurs in newborn infants. It usually occurs through infec-
tion of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly when the
stump is cut with an unsterile instrument. Neonatal tetanus
is common in some developing countries (estimated >500,000
deaths worldwide per year), but very rare in the United
States.
Complications
Laryngospasm (spasm of the vocal cords) and-or spasm of
the muscles of respiration leads to interference with breath-
ing.
Fractures of the spine or long bones are a result of
sustained contractions and convulsions.
Hyperactivity of the autonomic nervous system may
lead to hypertension and-or an abnormal heart rhythm.
Coma
Secondary infections, which may include sepsis from
indwelling catheters, hospital-acquired pneumonias, and
decubitus ulcers.
Pulmonary embolism is particularly a problem in drug
addicts and elderly patients.
Aspiration pneumonia is a common late complication of
tetanus, found in 50%-70% of autopsied cases.
Death. Approximately 30% of reported cases are fatal. In
the United States, most deaths occur in persons >50 years of
age. In about 20% of tetanus deaths, no obvious pathology is
identiﬁed and death is attributed to the direct effects of
tetanus toxin. The course usually lasts several weeks, with
gradual decline over time.

not confer immunity. Patients who survive the disease
should be given a complete series of vaccine.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of tetanus includes a number of
medical conditions which can simulate one or more of the
clinical ﬁndings. Some of these conditions include bacterial
meningitis, identiﬁed by positive spinal ﬂuid examination
(because of stiffness of the neck); severe mouth tissue or
dental infection (because of trismus); poliomyelitis; encepha-
litis; rabies; strychnine poisoning; side effect of phenothiaz-
ines, such as chlorpromazine; and muscle spasms due to low
blood calcium or hyperventilation.
Laboratory Diagnosis
There are no laboratory ﬁndings characteristic of tetanus.
The diagnosis is entirely clinical and does not depend upon
bacteriologic conﬁrmation. C. tetani is recovered from the
wound in only 30% of cases, and not infrequently, it is iso-
lated from patients who do not have tetanus. Laboratory
identiﬁcation of the organism depends most importantly on
the demonstration of toxin production in mice.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Occurrence is worldwide, but is most frequently encountered
in densely populated regions in hot, damp climates with soil
rich in organic matter.
Reservoir
Organisms are found primarily in the soil and intestinal
tracts of animals and humans.
Mode of Transmission
Transmission is primarily by contaminated wounds (appar-
ent and inapparent). The wound may be major or minor.
Most cases in the past had a severe wound, as the organism
requires extensive tissue damage to grow. In recent years,
however, a higher proportion of cases had minor wounds,
probably because severe wounds are more likely to be prop-
erly managed. Tetanus may follow elective surgery, burn
wounds, deep puncture wounds, crush wounds, otitis media
(ear infections), dental infection, animal bites, abortion, and
pregnancy.

TETANUS m
Communicability
Tetanus is not contagious from human to human. It is the
only vaccine-preventable disease that is infectious, but not
contagious.
Secular Trends in the United States
A marked decrease in mortality occurred from the early
1900s to the late 1940s. In the late 1940s, tetanus toxoid
was introduced into routine childhood immunization and
tetanus became nationally notiﬁable. At that time, there
were 500-600 cases reported per year (approximately
0.4 cases per 100,000 population).
After the 1940s, reported tetanus incidence rates fell
steadily. Since the mid-1970s, 50-100 cases have been
reported annually (~ 0.05 cases per 100,000). The death-to-
case ratio has been relatively constant at approximately
30%. An all-time low of 45 cases (0.02 cases per 100,000)
was reported in 1992.
The distribution of cases is nationwide; however, the largest
proportion occurs in the Southeast. From 1982 through
1992, 67% of reported cases of tetanus occurred among
persons 50 years of age or older. Rates among non-Hispanic
blacks and Hispanics are higher than among whites. Almost
all reported cases are in individuals who have either never
been vaccinated, or who completed a primary series but have
not had a booster in the preceding 10 years.
Heroin addicts, particularly persons who inject themselves
subcutaneously with quinine, appear to be at high risk for
tetanus. Quinine is used to dilute heroin and may actually
be predisposed to growth of C. tetani.
Neonatal tetanus is rare in the United States. The last case
was reported in Florida in 1989, following a home delivery by
a Central American woman who had not been previously
vaccinated and had received no prenatal care. The delivery
was assisted by a relative who cut the umbilical cord with
unsterilized scissors. Tap water was used to clean the um-
bilical stump.
During 1989-1990, an acute injury was reported in 78%
(n=86) of reported tetanus cases, and non-acute conditions in
13%. One-third of injuries occurred at home or indoors and
the other two-thirds in outdoor settings.

Three cases occurred among persons with insulin-dependent
diabetes, and a history of parenteral drug abuse was the only
associated condition for ﬁve patients. In 9% of reported
cases in 1989-1990, no wound or other condition could be
implicated. Under these circumstances, it is conceivable that
the site of infection may have been the intestinal tract or an
unrecalled minor wound.
Tetanus Toxoid
Tetanus toxoid has proved to be safe and useful since
Descombey ﬁrst reported its production in 1924. Tetanus
toxoid immunizations were used extensively in the armed
services during World War II. The incidence of tetanus cases
among this population dropped from 70 in World War I
(13.4/100,000 wounds and injuries) to 12 in World War II
(0.44/100,000). Of the 12 cases, half had received no prior
toxoid.
Tetanus toxoid consists of a formaldehyde-treated toxin. The
toxoid is standardized for potency in animal tests according
to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. Occa-
sionally, potency is mistakenly equated with Lf units, which
are a measure of the quantity of toxoid, not its potency in
inducing protection. A serum level of >001 International
Units per ml (IU-ml) in a human is considered protective.
There are two types of toxoid available — adsorbed (alumi-
num salt precipitated) toxoid and ﬂuid toxoid. Although the
rates of seroconversions are about equal, the adsorbed toxoid
is preferred because the antitoxin response reaches higher
titers and is longer lasting than with the ﬂuid toxoid.
There is virtually no reason to use tetanus toxoid as a
single antigen for protection. Instead, tetanus toxoid
should be given in combination with diphtheria toxoid, since
periodic boosting is needed against both diseases. Persons
7 years of age or older should receive Td (adult type); chil-
dren younger than 7 years of age should receive DTP, or
DTaP for the fourth and ﬁfth doses of the series.
Efficacy
Seroconversion rates
After a primary series of three properly spaced doses of
tetanus toxoid in persons >7 years of age and four doses in
children <7 years of age, essentially all recipients achieve
antitoxin levels considerably greater than the minimal
protective level of 0.01 IU/ml.


## p. (#55) #################################################

Clinical efficacy
Efficacy of the toxoid has never been studied in a vaccine
trial. It can be inferred from protective antitoxin levels that
a complete tetanus toxoid series has a clinical efficacy of
virtually 100%; cases of tetanus occurring in fully immunized
persons whose last dose was within the last 10 years are
extremely rare.
Duration of immunity
Following a properly administered primary series, virtually
all persons develop a protective level of antitoxin. Antitoxin
levels fall over time. While some persons may be protected
for life, most persons have antitoxin levels that approach the
minimal protective level by 10 years after the last dose. As a
result, routine boosters are recommended every 10 years.
In a small percentage of individuals, antitoxin levels fall
below the minimal protective level before 10 years have
elapsed. To ensure adequate protective antitoxin levels in all
individuals who sustain a wound that is other than clean and
minor, a booster is recommended if more than 5 years have
elapsed after the last dose. (See Wound Management for
details on persons who previously received fewer than three
doses.)
Routine childhood schedule
Primary tetanus immunization, usually with combined DTP
vaccine, is recommended for all persons at least 6 weeks old,
but less than 7 years of age without contraindications to
vaccination. A minimum of 4 weeks (typically 6-8 weeks)
should separate the ﬁrst and second, and second and third
doses of tetanus toxoid. The fourth dose of the primary
series should be given no less than 6 months after the third
dose.
A booster dose should be given after the 4th birthday but
before the 7th birthday unless the child received the fourth
dose of the primary series after the 4th birthday. Routine
booster doses of Td should be administered every 10 years.
Routine schedule for persons >7 years of age
Routine tetanus immunization, usually combined with
diphtheria toxoid, is recommended for all persons 7 years old
and older, with boosters every 10 years. Td, which contains
only one-third as much diphtheria toxoid as DT, is the
vaccine of choice because local adverse events from higher
doses of diphtheria toxoid and pertussis vaccine are more
common in older children and adults.

doses are separated by a minimum of 4 weeks, with the third
dose given 6-12 months after the second. A booster dose of
Td should be given every 10 years. If a dose is given as part
of wound management (see next page), the next booster is
not needed for 10 years thereafter. More frequent boost-
ers are not needed and have been reported to result in
an increased incidence and severity of adverse reac-
tions.
Adverse Events Following Vaccination
Local reactions
Local adverse events (e.g., erythema, induration, pain at the
injection site) are common but are usually self-limited and
require no therapy. A nodule may be palpable at the injec-
tion site of adsorbed products for several weeks. Abscess at
the site of injection has been reported. Fever and other
systemic symptoms are uncommon.
Exaggerated local (Arthus-like) reactions
These unusual reactions present as extensive painful swell-
ing, often from shoulder to elbow. They generally begin from
2 to 8 hours after injections, and are reported most often in
adults, particularly those who have received frequent doses
of tetanus toxoid. Persons experiencing these severe reac-
tions usually have very high serum tetanus antitoxin levels;
they should not be given further routine or emergency
booster doses of Td more frequently than every 10 years.
Less severe hypersensitivity local reactions may occur in
persons who have multiple prior boosters.
Severe systemic reactions
Severe systemic reactions such as generalized urticaria
(hives), anaphylaxis, or neurologic complications have been
reported after receipt of tetanus toxoid. A few cases of pe-
ripheral neuropathy and Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)
have been reported following tetanus toxoid administration.
Following a recent review, the Institute of Medicine con-
cluded that the available evidence favors a causal relation-
ship between tetanus toxoid and both brachial neuritis and
CBS, although these reactions are very rare.


## p. (#57) #################################################

Contraindications
7 \
A history of neurologic or severe allergic reaction (acute
respiratory distress or collapse) following a previous dose of
tetanus toxoid is a contraindication to receipt of tetanus
toxoid. If a generalized reaction is suspected to represent
allergy, it may be useful to refer an individual for appropri-
ate skin testing before discontinuing tetanus toxoid immuni-
zation.
A severe febrile illness is reason to defer routine vaccination,
but a minor illness without fever is not.
If a contraindication to using tetanus toxoid-containing
preparations exists, passive immunization with tetanus
immune globulin (TIG) against tetanus should be considered
whenever an injury other than a clean minor wound is
sustained.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
DTP vaccine, DT (pediatric), Td, DTP/Hib, DTaP, and teta-
nus toxoid should be stored continuously at 2°-8°C (35°-
46°F). The vaccine may be out of refrigeration for up to
4 days, but should be refrigerated immediately when re-
ceived. Freezing reduces the potency of the tetanus compo-
nent.
Wound Management
Prophylaxis (antibiotics) against tetanus is neither practical
nor useful in managing wounds; proper immunization plays
the more important role. The need for active immunization,
with or Without passive immunization, depends on the
condition of the wound and the patient’s immunization
history (see table at right). Rarely have cases of tetanus
occurred in persons with a documented primary series of
tetanus toxoid injections.
Note that persons with wounds that are neither clean nor
minor, and who have had 0-2 prior doses or have an uncer-
tain history of prior doses, need tetanus immune globulin
(TIG) as well as Td toxoids. This is because early doses of
toxoid do not induce immunity, but simply sensitize the
body. The TIG provides temporary immunity by directly
providing antitoxin. This ensures that protective levels of
antitoxin are achieved even if the body’s immune response
has not yet taken effect.

Pertussis
tious disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella
pertussis. Outbreaks of pertussis were ﬁrst
described in the 16th century, and the organism was ﬁrst
isolated in 1906.
P ERTUSSIS, OR WHOOPING COUGH, IS AN ACUTE INFEC-
In the 20th century pertussis has been one of the most
common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood
mortality in the United States. Prior to the availability of
pertussis vaccine in the 1940s, over 200,000 cases of
pertussis were reported annually. Since widespread use of
the vaccine began, incidence has decreased 99%, to an aver-
age of about 3,000 cases per year since 1980.
In unimmunized populations in the world, however, pertus-
sis remains a major health problem among children, with an
estimated 300,000 deaths per year due to the disease.
Bordetella pertussis
B. pertussis is a‘small aerobic gram-negative rod. It is
fastidious, and requires special media for isolation (see
section on Laboratory Diagnosis).
B. pertussis produces multiple antigenic and biologically
active products, including pertussis toxin, ﬁlamentous he-
magglutinin, agglutinogens, adenylate cyclase, pertactin,
and tracheal cytotoxin. These products are responsible for
the clinical features of pertussis disease, and an immune
response to one or more produces immunity to subsequent
clinical illness.

Pathogenesis
Pertussis is primarily a toxin-mediated disease. The bacte-
ria attach to the respiratory cilia, produce toxins that para-
lyze the cilia, and cause inﬂammation of the respiratory
tract, thus interfering with the clearing of pulmonary secre-
tions, and potentially causing pneumonia. Pertussis anti-
gens appear to allow the organism to evade host defenses, in
that lymphocytosis is promoted but chemotaxis is impaired.
Until recently it was thought that B. pertussis did not invade
the tissues, however, recent work has shown the bacteria in
alveolar macrophages.
Clinical Features
The incubation period of pertussis is commonly 5 to 10 days,
with an upper limit of 21 days. The clinical course of the
illness is divided into three stages.
The first stage, the catarrhal stage, is characterized by the
insidious onset of coryza (runny nose), sneezing, low-grade
fever, and a mild, occasional cough, similar to the common
cold. The cough gradually becomes more severe, and after 1-
2 weeks, the second, or paroxysmal stage, begins.
It is during the paroxysmal stage that the diagnosis of
pertussis is usually suspected. Characteristically, the pa-
tient has bursts, or paroxysms of numerous, rapid coughs,
apparently due to difficulty expelling thick mucus from the
tracheobronchial tree. At the end of the paroxysm, a long
inspiratory effort is usually accompanied by a characteristic
high-pitched whoop. During such an attack, the patient may
become cyanotic (turn blue). Children and young infants,
especially, appear very ill and distressed. Vomiting and
exhaustion commonly follow the episode. The patient usu-
ally appears normal between attacks.
Paroxysmal attacks occur more frequently at night, with an
average of 15 attacks per 24 hours. During the first 1 or
2 weeks of this stage the attacks increase in frequency, then
remain at the same level for 2 to 3 weeks, and then gradually
decrease. The paroxysmal stage usually lasts 1 to 6 weeks,
but may persist for up to 10 weeks. Infants under 6 months
of age may not have the strength to have a whoop, but they
do have paroxysms of coughing.
In the last stage, the convalescent stage, recovery is
gradual. The cough becomes less paroxysmal and disappears
over 2 to 3 weeks. However, paroxysms often recur with
subsequent respiratory infections for many months after the
onset of pertussis. Fever is generally minimal throughout
the course of pertussis.


## p. (#61) #################################################

PERTUSSIS a
Older persons (i.e., adolescents and adults), and those partially
protected by the vaccine may become infected with
B. pertussis, but usually have milder disease. Pertussis in
these persons may present as a persistent (>7 days) cough,
and may be indistinguishable from other upper respiratory
infections. Inspiratory whoop is uncommon. In some stud-
ies, B. pertussis has been isolated from 25% or more of adults
with cough illness lasting >7 days.
Even though the disease may be milder in older persons,
these infected persons may transmit the disease to other
susceptible persons, including unimmunized or underimmu-
nized infants. Adults are often found to be the ﬁrst case in a
household with multiple pertussis cases.
Complications
Young infants are at highest risk for acquiring pertussis and
pertussis-associated complications. The most common
complication and the cause of most pertussis-related deaths
is secondary bacterial pneumonia. Data for 1989-1991
indicate that pneumonia occurred among 12% of all reported
pertussis cases and among 16% of infants <6 months of age.
Neurologic complications such as seizures and cephalopathy
(a diffuse disorder of the brain) may occur as a result of
hypoxia (reduction of oxygen supply) from coughing, or
possibly from toxin. Neurologic complications of pertussis
are more common among infants. From 1989 through 1991,
seizures and encephalopathy occurred among 1.6% and 0.1%,
respectively, of all reported cases and among 1.8% and 0.2%,
respectively, of infants younger than 6 months old.
Other less serious complications include otitis media,
anorexia, and dehydration. Complications resulting from
pressure effects of severe paroxysms include pneumothorax,
epistaxis, subdural hematomas, hernias, and rectal prolapse.
In the United States from 1989 through 1991, 41% of all
reported pertussis cases were hospitalized, including 69% of
infants. From 1989 through 1991, 20 deaths due to pertussis
(case-fatality rate=0.2%) were reported. The case-fatality
rate was highest in infants younger than 6 months of age
and generally decreased with increasing age.
Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of pertussis is usually based upon a character-
istic history and physical examination. However, laboratory
tests may be useful in young infants, atypical cases, and
cases modiﬁed by vaccine.

Fastidious growth requirements make B. pertussis difﬁcult
to isolate. Isolation of the organism using direct plating is
most successful during the catarrhal stage. Specimens from
the posterior nasopharynx, not the throat, should be ob-
tained using dacron or calcium alginate (not cotton) swabs
and should be plated directly onto selective media. Regan-
Lowe agar or freshly prepared Bordet-Gengou medium is
generally used. Success in isolating the organism declines
with prior antibiotic therapy effective against pertussis
(erythromycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) or delay in
specimen collection beyond the ﬁrst 3 weeks of illness.
A second method of B. pertussis identiﬁcation in nasopharyn-
geal specimens is the direct ﬂuorescent antibody (DFA)
technique. Because direct ﬂuorescent antibody testing of
nasopharyngeal secretions has been shown in some studies
to have low sensitivity and variable speciﬁcity, it should not
be relied on as a criterion for laboratory conﬁrmation.
An elevated white blood cell count with a lymphocytosis is
usually present in classical disease. The absolute lympho-
cyte count often reaches 20,000 or greater. However, there
may be no lymphocytosis in infants and children or in mild
or modiﬁed cases of pertussis.
Medical Management
The medical management of pertussis cases is primarily
supportive, although antibiotics are of some value. Erythro-
mycin is the drug of choice. This therapy eradicates the
organism from secretions, thereby decreasing communicabil-
ity and, if initiated early, may modify the course of the
illness.
Erythromycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis
should be administered for 14 days to all household and
other close contacts of persons with pertussis, regardless of
age and vaccination status. Although data from controlled
clinical trials are lacking, prophylaxis of all household mem-
bers and other close contacts may prevent or minimize
transmission. All close contacts <7 years of age who have
not completed the four-dose primary series should complete
the series with the minimal intervals. Those who have
completed a primary series but have not received a dose of
DTP or DTaP within 3 years of exposure should be given a
booster dose.

adopted by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiolo-
gists (CSTE) and the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) is as follows:

Case Definition
The current case deﬁnition for pertussis, developed and

Clinical case definition
A cough illness lasting at least 2 weeks with either parox-
ysms of coughing, inspiratory “whoop,” or post-tussive vomit-
ing without other apparent cause (as reported by a health
professional).
Case Classification
Probable - Meets the clinical case deﬁnition, is not labora-

laboratory-conﬁrmed case.
Confirmed - A clinically compatible case that is laboratory
conﬁrmed or epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-con-
ﬁrmed case.
The clinical case deﬁnition above is appropriate for endemic
or sporadic cases. In outbreak settings, a case may be de-
ﬁned as a cough illness lasting at least 2 weeks (as reported
by a health professional). Because direct ﬂuorescent antibody
testing of nasopharyngeal secretions has been shown in some
studies to have low sensitivity and variable speciﬁcity, it
should not be relied on as a criterion for laboratory conﬁrma-
tion.
Both probable and conﬁrmed cases should be reported to the

A silent carrier state is thought to exist, but is infrequent,
transient in duration, and probably of little importance in
maintaining pertussis organisms in the community.
Temporal pattern
Pertussis has no distinct seasonal pattern, but may increase
in the summer and fall.
Communicability
Pertussis is highly communicable, as evidenced by secondary
attack rates of 7 0%-100% among unimmunized household
contacts.
The contagious period is from 7 days following exposure to
3 weeks after onset of paroxysms, with maximum conta-
giousness during the catarrhal stage, usually before the
diagnosis of pertussis is suspected.
Secular Trends in the United States
Prior to the availability of vaccine, pertussis was a common
cause of morbidity and mortality among children. During
the six years of 1940-1945, over 1 million cases of pertussis
were reported, an average of 175,000 cases per year (inci-
dence of approximately 150 cases per 100,000 population).
Following introduction of vaccine in the 1940s, pertussis
incidence gradually fell, reaching 15,000 reported cases in
1960 (~8 per 100,000 population). By 1970, annual incidence
was <5000 cases per year, and from 1980-1990, an average of
2,900 cases per year were reported (~1 per 100,000 popula-
tion).
Pertussis incidence increased in 1992-1993. In 1993, a total
of 6,586 cases and 12 deaths were reported, the largest
number since 1967 (2.4 per 100,000 population). Large
outbreaks were reported in Chicago (166 cases) and Cincin-
nati (352 cases). The reasons for the increase are not clear,
but may be a reﬂection of the 3-5 year cyclicity observed with
the disease.
Children are the most commonly reported victims of pertus-
sis. From 1982-1992, 45% of all reported cases were among
children <1 year of age, and 69% were <5 years of age. In
contrast, only 6% of cases were reported in adults >30 years
of age. In 1993, infants <1 year of age were over 200 times
more likely to be reported with pertussis than adults
>20 years of age (incidence of 80 per 100,000 and 0.35 per
100,000, respectively).

Of the 9,811 children 3 months to 4 years of age with re-
ported pertussis during 1980-1989 and known vaccination
status, 64% were not age-appropriately vaccinated with DTP.
Pertussis Vaccine
Whole-cell pertussis vaccine
Whole-cell pertussis vaccine is composed of a suspension of
formalin-inactivated B. pertussis cells. It was developed in
the 1930s, and used widely in clinical practice by the mid-
1940s. The composition was standardized in 1949.
The current whole-cell vaccine is available in combination
with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids as DTP, and as single
antigen pertussis vaccine. It is routinely administered as a
ﬁve-dose series beginning at 2 months of age.

‘Either whole-cell DTP or DTaP can be used for the fourth and ﬁfth doses; DTaP is generally
preferred, if available. If DTaP is used for the fourth dose, it should be administered at 15 months
of age.
In recent studies, the efficacy of three or more doses of per-
tussis vaccine has been estimated to be 70%-90%. Protection
from pertussis vaccine is thought to decrease over time, but
the rate of decrease has not been well established. One
study showed an efficacy of 80% 3 years after the last dose,
50% if 4 to 7 years had elapsed since the last dose, and
virtually none after 12 years. While previous receipt of a
primary series of pertussis vaccine may not offer complete
immunity, breakthrough disease is usually milder than
disease that occurs in unvaccinated or incompletely vacci-
nated individuals.

Acellular pertussis vaccine
Acellular pertussis vaccine contains puriﬁed, inactivated
components of B. pertussis cells. Several acellular pertussis
vaccines have been developed which contain different compo-
nents in varying concentrations, but all of these vaccines
contain pertussis toxin (PT), and usually ﬁlamentous hemag-
glutinin (FHA).
There are currently two acellular pertussis vaccines licensed
for use in the United States. Both vaccines are combined
with diphtheria and tetanus toxoid as DTaP. The vaccine
manufactured by Lederle (Acel-ImmuneR) contains
four components, primarily FHA (86%) and PT (8%). The
vaccine manufactured by Connaught (TripediaR) contains
only PT and FHA in equal amounts.
DTaP is licensed for use as the fourth dose of the primary
series and the booster (ﬁfth) dose. In addition, the vaccine is
only licensed for use in children 15 months to 6 years of age
(before the 7th birthday).
DTaP vaccine is not licensed for the initial three-dose
diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccination series re-
gardless of the child’s age.
The vaccine is not licensed for the initial three doses because
questions remain about whether the vaccine confers clinical
protection when administered in early infancy, and whether
protection induced at any age is equivalent to that of whole-
cell pertussis vaccine. Several clinical trials to evaluate the
relative protective efficacy of primary vaccination of infants
with DTaP vaccines compared with whole-cell DTP vaccine
are nearing completion.
Either whole-cell DTP or DTaP can be used interchangeably
for the fourth and ﬁfth doses of the routine series of vaccina-
tion against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis in children
aged 15 months or older. The ACIP recommends the use of
DTaP, if readily available, because of its substantially re-
duced likelihood of causing local reactions, fever, and other
common systemic reactions which often follow receipt of
whole-cell DTP.
The primary series of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis
vaccination consists of four doses of vaccine, the ﬁrst three
doses (using whole-cell DTP vaccine) given at 4-to 8-week
intervals (minimum of 4 weeks), beginning at 6 weeks to
2 months of age. The fourth dose, of either whole-cell DTP or
DTaP, is given 6-12 months after the third to maintain
adequate immunity for the ensuing preschool years. The
fourth dose of whole cell DTP may be given as early as


## p. (#67) #################################################

PER TUSSIS E
12 months of age, but only if at least 6 months have elapsed
since the third dose. If DTaP is used for the fourth dose, it
should not be given until 15 months of age.
Children who received all four primary immunizing doses
before the 4th birthday should receive a single dose of whole-
cell DTP or DTaP before entering school. This booster dose
is not necessary if the fourth dose in the primary series was
given on or after the 4th birthday. The booster dose in-
creases protective antibody levels and may decrease the risk
of school-age children transmitting the disease to younger
siblings who may not be fully vaccinated.
Because vaccine reactions are thought to be more frequent in
older age groups, and because of decreasing pertussis-associ-
ated morbidity and mortality with increasing age, routine
vaccination with whole-cell DTP or DTaP against pertussis is
not recommended after the 7th birthday.
Interruption of the recommended schedule or delayed
doses probably do not lead to a reduction in the level of
immunity reached on completion of the primary series.
Therefore, there is no need to restart a series regardless of
the time that has elapsed between doses.
Seroconversion rates and rates of side effects with simulta-
neous administration of whole-cell DTP, oral poliovirus
vaccine (OPV), and-or measles-mumps-rubella vaccine
(MMR) are similar to those observed when the vaccines are
administered separately. Therefore, this practice is recom-
mended when age-appropriate, especially when there is
doubt that the vaccine recipient will return for further vac-
cine doses.
The simultaneous administration of DTaP, OPV and MMR
has not been evaluated. However, based on studies using
whole-cell DTP, the ACIP does not anticipate any differences
in Seroconversion rates and rates of side effects from those
observed when the vaccines are administered separately.
Adverse Events Following Vaccination
Local reactions, generally erythema and induration with or
without tenderness, are common after the administration of
DTP vaccine and are usually related to the pertussis compo-
nent. Sterile abscesses at the injection site have been re-
ported rarely (6-10/ 1,000,000 doses of DTP). Mild systemic
reactions such as fever, drowsiness, fretfulness, and anorexia
occur frequently. These reactions are substantially more
common following the administration of DTP than of DT, but
they are self-limited and can be safely managed with symp-
tomatic treatment.

Signiﬁcantly fewer local adverse events (redness, swelling,
pain) and fever are reported following the fourth and ﬁfth
dose of DTaP vaccine than following whole cell vaccine.
Following whole cell vaccine, moderate-to-severe systemic
events including high fever (i.e., temperature of 240.5°C
[105°F]); persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 23 hours;
collapse (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode); or short-lived
convulsions (usually febrile), occur infrequently and do not
appear to cause permanent sequelae. Other more severe
neurologic events, such as a prolonged convulsion or
encephalopathy, although rare, have been reported in
temporal association with DTP administration.
Two major studies address adverse events following whole-
cell pertussis vaccine. Cody et al., prospectively studied
reaction rates following the administration of 15,752 doses of
DTP vaccine and 784 doses of DT vaccine (without pertussis
component) in children 0-6 years of age. This study provides
the best available rates of occurrence for individual local and
systemic effects excluding encephalopathy (see table).

Study results suggested that as the number of previous doses
increased, the incidence of local reactions and fever
increased, but the incidence of other systemic reactions
decreased.
In this series, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes (collapse or
shock-like episodes) and convulsions each occurred at a rate
of 1 per 1,750 doses of DTP vaccine administered. In
comparison, seizures accompanying pertussis illness
occurred at a rate of 1 per 25 to 1 per 200 cases. The
frequency of more severe adverse events following DTaP
vaccine has not yet been established, but is likely to be lower
than with whole-cell vaccine.


## p. i (#69) ###############################################

Rarely, immediate anaphylactic reactions (i.e., swelling of
the mouth, breathing difﬁculty, hypotension, or shock) have
been reported after receipt of preparations containing diph-
theria, tetanus, and-or pertussis antigens. However, no
deaths caused by anaphylaxis following DTP vaccination
have been reported to CDC since the inception of vaccine-
adverse-events reporting began in 1978, a period during
which more than 80 million doses of publicly purchased DTP
vaccine were administered. Although no causal relationship
to any speciﬁc component of DTP has been established, the
occurrence of true anaphylaxis usually contraindicates
further doses of any one of these components.
Neurologic events
To determine whether DTP vaccine causes serious neurologic
illness (such as encephalitis) and brain damage, the National
Childhood Encephalopathy Study (NCES) was undertaken
during 1976-1979 in Great Britain. This large case-control
study attempted to identify every patient with serious, acute,
childhood neurologic illness admitted to a hospital in
England, Scotland, and Wales. A total of 1,182 children
2-36 months of age were identiﬁed. Thirty of these children
had received DTP vaccine within 7 days prior to the reported
onset of their neurologic illness. Analysis of the data from
these patients and from age-matched control children
showed a signiﬁcant association (odds ratio=3.3; 95% conﬁ-
dence interval 1.7-6.5) between the development of serious
acute neurologic illness and receipt of DTP vaccine. Most of
the serious acute neurologic illnesses were prolonged sei-
zures with fever. The 30 children were followed up for at
least 12 months to determine whether they had neurologic
sequelae. Seven of these children, presumed to have been
previously normal neurologically, had died or had subse-
quent neurologic impairment. A causal relationship between
receipt of DTP vaccine and permanent neurologic injury was
suggested. The estimated attributable risk for DTP vaccine
was 1:330,000 closes, with a wide conﬁdence interval.
The methods and results of the NCES have been thoroughly
scrutinized since publication of the study. This reassessment
by multiple groups has determined that the number of
patients was too small and their classiﬁcation was subject to
enough uncertainty to preclude drawing valid conclusions
about whether a causal relationship exists between pertussis
vaccine and permanent neurologic damage. In addition,
subsequent studies have failed to provide evidence to support
a causal relationship between DTP vaccination and either
serious acute neurologic illness or permanent neurologic
injury.

In 1991 and 1993, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) conducted
comprehensive reviews of all available data on the
relationship of encephalopathy and pertussis vaccine. The
1991 report concluded that the available evidence suggests a
causal relationship between the receipt of pertussis-
containing vaccine and acute encephalopathy, and estimated
the excess risk as 0-10.5 cases per million doses
administered. In 1993, the IOM concluded that the available
evidence suggests a causal relationship between receipt of
pertussis vaccine and chronic encephalopathy, based largely
on data from the NCES studies. However, the IOM
concluded that there was no evidence of chronic
encephalopathy except in children who developed acute
encephalopathy.
Contraindications and Precautions
Contraindications
Contraindications to further vaccination with DTP are severe
allergic reaction to a prior dose of vaccine or vaccine
component, and encephalopathy not due to another
identifiable cause within 7 days of vaccination. Moderate to
severe illness is a contraindication to vaccination, but mild
illness, such as otitis media or upper respiratory infection, is
not a contraindication. Children whose vaccination is
deferred due to moderate to severe illness should be
vaccinated when their conditions improve.
Precautions
Certain infrequent adverse events following pertussis
vaccination will generally contraindicate subsequent doses of
pertussis vaccine. These adverse events are:
Temperature of 240.5°C (105°F) within 48 hours not due to
another identiﬁable cause.
Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive
episode) within 48 hours.
Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting 23 hours, occurring
within 48 hours.
Convulsions with or without fever occurring within 3 days.
However, there may be circumstances in which the benefit of
the vaccine outweighs the risk of an adverse event (e.g.,
during a community-wide outbreak of pertussis). Under
these circumstances, one or more additional doses of


## p. iii (#71) #############################################

PER TLISSIS m
pertussis vaccine may be considered, even if one of the four
precautionary adverse events occurred following a previous
dose.
Acellular pertussis vaccine should not be substituted in
children who have a valid contraindication to whole cell
pertussis vaccine. If a valid contraindication or precaution
exists, DT should be used (except in the case of moderate to
severe illness, when DTP or DTaP should be given after
recovery).
Vaccination of infants and young children who have
underlying neurologic disorders
Infants and children with recognized, possible, or potential
underlying neurologic conditions present a unique problem.
They seem to be at increased risk for manifesting the
underlying neurologic disorder within 2-3 days after
vaccination. However, more prolonged manifestations or
increased progression of the disorder, or exacerbation of the
disorder have not been recognized.
Under certain circumstances, vaccination with DTP vaccine
should be delayed until the child has been evaluated,
treatment initiated, and the condition stabilized. These
conditions include the presence of an evolving neurologic
disorder (e.g., uncontrolled epilepsy, infantile spasms, and
progressive encephalopathy), a history of seizures which has
not been evaluated, or a neurologic event which occurs
between doses of pertussis vaccine.
A family history of seizures or other neurologic diseases, or
stable or resolved neurologic conditions (e.g., controlled
idiopathic epilepsy, cerebral palsy, developmental delay) are
not contraindications.
Reduced dosage schedules or multiple small doses
Reducing the dose of whole-cell DTP or DTaP vaccine, or
giving the full dose in multiple smaller doses may result in
an altered immune response and inadequate protection.
Furthermore, there is no evidence that the frequency of
signiﬁcant vaccine reactions is likely to be reduced by this
practice.
The use of multiple reduced doses that together equal a full
immunizing dose or the use of smaller divided doses is not
endorsed or recommended. Any vaccination using less than
the standard dose or a nonstandard route or site of
administration should not be counted, and the person
should be revaccinated according to age.

linked to a culture-proven case, as may occur during out-
breaks. When such conﬁrmation of diagnosis is lacking, DTP
vaccination should be completed, because presumed pertus-
sis syndrome may have been caused by other Bordetella
species, Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
or certain viruses.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
The DTP vaccine should be stored continuously at 2°-8°C
(35°-46°F). The pertussis antigen is most susceptible to
extremes of temperature, although normal ambient tempera-
ture up to 4 days will not destroy it. Freezing, on the other
hand, substantially reduces the potency of the pertussis
component.
Other Considerations About the Pertussis
Vaccine Controversy
In addition to the adverse events following DTP vaccination
already discussed, other issues about the safety, efficacy, and
beneﬁt of pertussis vaccine have been raised by its oppo-
nents. They argue that (1) a number of other events, includ-
ing SIDS and infantile spasms, may be related to DTP
vaccination; (2) the decline in pertussis incidence is due to
improvements in living conditions and not to pertussis
vaccine; (3) modern medical therapy makes pertussis disease
a relatively trivial illness. To summarize, they argue that
the risks of vaccine usage outweigh the beneﬁts. It is impor-
tant to examine each of these issues in greater depth.
There is no distinct syndrome resulting from vaccine admin-
istration, and therefore many temporally associated adverse
events probably represent background illness rather than
illness caused by vaccine. This distinction is critical, as the
ﬁrst year of life is also the time when many congenital
neurologic disorders ﬁrst become manifest. Further, the
known febrile and other systemic effects of DTP vaccination
may stimulate or precipitate inevitable symptoms of underly-
ing central-nervous system disorders, such as febrile seizures
and epilepsy, particularly since DTP may be the ﬁrst pyro-
genic stimulus an infant receives.


## p. v (#73) ###############################################

Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has occurred among
infants who had recently received DTP or DT. In the largest
SIDS study to date conducted by the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), SIDS cases were actually less
likely to have recently received DTP than non-SIDS cases.
The onset of infantile spasms has occurred among infants
who had recently received DTP or DT. A case-control study
of infantile spasms in England showed that receipt of DTP or
DT was not causally related to infantile spasms, but that
receipt of DTP may trigger onset in children in whom the
disorder is destined to develop. By chance alone, some cases
of SIDS and infantile spasms can be expected to be tempo-
rally related to the recent receipt of DTP or DT.
Claims that DTP may be responsible for transverse myelitis,
other more subtle neurological disorders (such as hyperactiv-
ity, learning disorders, and infantile autism), and progres-
sive degenerative central-nervous-system conditions have no
scientific basis.
Besides the evidence of vaccine efficacy of 70%-90% noted
before, other data point to the effectiveness of pertussis
vaccination. Mortimer studied the relative impact of vacci-
nation versus improved living conditions on pertussis inci-
dence. He reviewed deaths from pertussis in children less
than 5 years of age from 1900 to 1974, and showed an accel-
eration of the decline in pertussis mortality beginning in
1940 when vaccine was ﬁrst widely used. Only 52 deaths
from pertussis occurred from 1970 until 1974, when
4,000-8,000 deaths would have been expected on the basis of
the rate of decline before 1940.
Another way of studying the effectiveness of DTP vaccination
is to examine the experience in nations where pertussis
vaccine utilization has declined. In Japan, for example,
pertussis vaccination was used nationwide by 1950. By
1974, pertussis incidence had dropped from 100 cases to
1 case per 100,000 population. However, in the last half of
the 1970s, vaccine utilization in Japan markedly decreased
after two deaths occurred following pertussis immunization.
A major epidemic of pertussis ensued, with an increase in
incidence rate to 11.5 per 100,000 in 1977, and an increase in
the annual number of deaths from an average of less than
5 for the years 1970-1974 to an average of 32 during
1977-1979.
In the United Kingdom, an estimated 75% of children were
fully vaccinated between 1958 and 1974. Following allega-
tions of adverse reactions after pertussis immunization, the
estimated coverage of children fell to 30% by 197 8. A major
epidemic occurred in 1978-1979, with an incidence rate as

compare the outcomes with or without a vaccination program
using a hypothetical cohort of 1 million children from birth to
6 years of age who received and did not receive pertussis
vaccination. The ratio of overall costs without a program to
those with a program was 57:1. The beneﬁt-cost ratio
(reduction in disease costs divided by program costs) was
11.1:1. Without a program, the estimated annual number of
residual defects from encephalitis (both vaccine and disease
induced) would decrease from 54 to 29 cases. However, the
estimated annual deaths from pertussis would increase more
than 10-fold, from 44 to 457.
Pertussis Surveillance
Pertussis cases are reported to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention via two systems. First, the states
provide information about cases of pertussis, including age,
gender, county of residence, and date of onset, to the Morbid-
ity and Mortality Weekly Report (MM WR) ofﬁce. Most states
provide this information on a weekly basis, but for some
there is lengthy delay in reporting. The second system, the
Supplementary Pertussis Surveillance System (SPSS),
consists of detailed epidemiologic information received on
about 80% of cases reported to the MM WR . Although many
pertussis cases go unreported, the surveillance system is
useful for monitoring epidemiologic trends. For instance, the
highest incidence of pertussis occurs in infancy, the age
group at greatest risk for severe illness and complications.
In recent years, the surveillance system has reﬂected an
increase in the incidence of pertussis in all age groups, most
notably among adolescents and adults.

Chapter
Poliom yelilis
HE WORD POLIO (GREY) AND MYELON (MARROW,
l indicating the spinal cord) are derived from the Greek
roots which describe the tissue most commonly
affected in the spinal cord which leads to the classic manifes-
tations of paralysis.
Although records from antiquity mention crippling diseases
compatible with poliomyelitis, it was Michael Underwood
from Britain who, in 1789, ﬁrst described a debility of the
lower extremities in children that was recognizable as polio-
myelitis. The ﬁrst outbreak described in the United States
was in 1843. In 1952, 58,000 cases of poliomyelitis were
reported in the United States.
Pohovnus
Poliovirus is a member of the enterovirus subgroup, family
Picornaviridae. Enteroviruses are transient inhabitants of
the gastrointestinal tract, and are stable at acid pH. Picor-
naviruses are small, ether-insensitive viruses with an RNA
genome.
There are three poliovirus serotypes (P1, P2, and P3). There
is minimal heterotypic immunity between the three sero-
types.
The poliovirus is rapidly inactivated by heat, formaldehyde,
chlorine, and ultraviolet light.
Pathogenesis
The mouth is the portal of entry of the virus and primary
multiplication of the virus occurs at the site of implantation
in the pharynx and gastrointestinal tract. The virus is
usually present in the throat and in the stools before the
onset of illness. One week after onset there is little virus in
the throat, but virus continues to be excreted in the stools for
several weeks. The virus invades local lymphoid tissue,
enters the blood stream, and then may infect cells of the

central nervous system. Replication of poliovirus in motor
neurons of the anterior horn and brain stem results in cell
destruction and causes the typical manifestations of
poliomyelitis.
Clinical Features
The incubation period for poliomyelitis is commonly 6 to
20 days with a range from 3 to 35 days.
The response to poliovirus infection is highly variable and
has been categorized based on the severity of clinical presen-
tation.
inapparent infection without symptoms
Up to 95% of all polio infections are inapparent or subclini-
cal. Estimates of the ratio of inapparent to paralytic illness
vary from 50:1 to 1,000:1 (usually 200:1). Infected persons
without symptoms shed virus in the stool, and are able to
transmit the virus to others.
Minor illness (abortive poliomyelitis)
Approximately 5% (4%-8%) of polio infections consist of a
nonspeciﬁc illness without clinical or laboratory evidence of
central nervous system invasion and are characterized by
complete recovery in less than a week. Three syndromes
observed with this form of poliovirus infection are upper
respiratory tract infection (sore throat and fever), gas-
trointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, constipation or, rarely, diarrhea), and inﬂuenza-like
illness. These syndromes are indistinguishable from other
viral illnesses.
Nonparalytic poliomyelitis
Nonparalytic aseptic meningitis (symptoms of stiffness of the
neck, back, and-or legs) usually following several days after a
prodrome similar to that of minor illness occur in 1%-2% of
polio infections. Increased or abnormal sensations can also
occur. Typically these symptoms will last from 2 to l0 days
followed by complete recovery.
Paralytic poliomyelitis
Less than 2% of all polio infections result in a ﬂaccid paraly-
sis (usually less than 1%). Paralytic symptoms generally
begin 1 to 10 days after prodromal symptoms and progress
for 2 to 3 days. Generally, no further paralysis occurs after
the temperature returns to normal. The prodrome may be
biphasic, especially in children, with initial minor symptoms
separated by a 1- to 7 -day period from more major symptoms.
Additional prodromal signs and symptoms can include a loss


## p. ix (#77) ##############################################

POL-OM YELIT IS
of superﬁcial reﬂexes, initially increased deep tendon re-
ﬂexes and severe muscle aches and spasms in the limbs or
back. The illness progresses to ﬂaccid paralysis with dimin-
ished deep tendon reﬂexes which reaches a plateau without
change for days to weeks and is usually asymmetrical.
Strength then begins to return. Patients do not experience
sensory losses or changes in cognition.
Many persons with paralytic poliomyelitis recover completely
and, in most, muscle function returns to some degree. Pa-
tients with weakness or paralysis 12 months after onset will
usually be left with permanent residua.
Paralytic polio is classiﬁed into three types, depending on
the level of involvement. Spinal polio is most common, and
accounted for 79% of paralytic cases from 1969-1979. It is
characterized by asymmetric paralysis that most often
involves the legs. Bulbar polio accounts for 2% of cases and
leads to weakness of muscles innervated by cranial nerves.
Bulbospinal polio accounts for 19% of cases and is a combi-
nation of bulbar and spinal paralysis.
The death-to-case ratio for paralytic polio is generally 2%-5%
in children and up to 15%-30% in adults (depending on age).
It increases to 25%-75% with bulbar involvement.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Viral isolation
Poliovirus may be recovered from the stool or pharynx from a
person with presumed poliomyelitis. Isolation of virus from
the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) is diagnostic but is rarely
accomplished.
If poliovirus is isolated from a person with acute ﬂaccid
paralysis, it must be tested further, using oligonucleotide
mapping (ﬁngerprinting) or genomic sequencing, to deter-
mine if the virus is “wild-like” or “vaccine-like.”
Serology
Neutralizing antibodies appear early and may be at high
levels by the time the patient is hospitalized and, therefore, a
4-fold rise may not be demonstrated.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
The CSF in poliovirus infection usually contains an in-
creased number of white blood cells (10 to 200 cells-mm3,
primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein from
40 to 50 mg-100 ml.

Epidemiology
Reservoir
Humans are the only known reservoir of poliovirus, which is
transmitted most frequently by persons with inapparent
infections. There is no asymptomatic carrier state except in
immune deﬁcient persons.
Transmission
Person-to-person spread of poliovirus via the fecal-oral route
is the most important route of transmission, although the
oral-oral route may account for some cases.
Temporal pattern
Poliovirus infection typically peaks in the summer months in
temperate climates. There is no seasonal pattern in tropical
climates.
Communicability
Poliovirus is highly infectious, with seroconversion rates in
susceptible household contacts of children nearly 100% and
of adults over 90%. Cases are most infections from 7 to
10 days before and after the onset of symptoms, but poliovi-
rus may be present in the stool from 3 to 6 weeks.
Predominant serotype
Nearly all epidemics are due to type 1, whereas types 2 and
3 are more often isolated in vaccine-associated poliomyelitis.
Secular Trends in the United States
Before the 18th century, polioviruses probably circulated
widely and initial infections to at least one type probably
occurred in early infancy, when transplacentally acquired
maternal antibodies were high. Exposure throughout life
probably provided continual boosting of immunity and para-
lytic infections were probably rare. (This View has been
recently challenged based on data of lameness studies in
developing countries.)
In the immediate pre-vaccine era, improved sanitation
allowed less frequent exposure and increased the age of
primary infection. There was infrequent boosting of immu-
nity from natural exposure, pooling of susceptibles, and
ultimately the occurrence of epidemics, with 13,000 to 20,000
paralytic cases reported annually.

In the early vaccine era, the incidence dramatically de-
creased following IPV introduction in 1955. The decline
continued following OPV introduction in 1961. In 1960, a
total of 2,525 paralytic cases were reported, compared with
61 in 1965.
The last case of paralytic poliomyelitis caused by endemic
transmission of wild virus in the United States was reported
in 1979. An annual average of nine cases per year was
reported in 1980-1991. The majority of these cases were
caused by vaccine-type viruses in recipients of oral polio
vaccine or their susceptible contacts.

Outbreaks of poliomyelitis in the United States since
1970
In 1970, on the Texas-Mexico border, 22 cases occurred, all in
children 4 years of age or less. In 1972, in a Christian Sci-
ence school in Connecticut, eight cases of paralytic poliomy-
elitis and three of non-paralytic occurred in persons from 7 to
18 years of age. In 1979, among the Amish (two non-Amish)
in Pennsylvania, Missouri, Iowa, and Wisconsin, ten para-
lytic and five non-paralytic cases of poliomyelitis occurred,
with a mean age of 12 years.
Poliovirus Vaccine
Inactivated (Salk) polio vaccine (IPV) was licensed in 1955
and was used extensively from that time until the early
1960s. Approximately 428 million doses have been adminis-
tered in the United States, mostly before 1962. In 1961, type

1 and 2 monovalent oral polio vaccine (MOPV) was licensed,
and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent
oral polio vaccine (OPV) was licensed and largely replaced
IPV use. An enhanced-potency IPV was licensed in Novem-
ber 1987, and ﬁrst became available in 1988. From 1969-
1986, nearly 420 million doses of OPV were distributed at a
relatively constant average of 24 million doses per year.
Since 1979, approximately 30,000 doses of IPV have been
distributed per year.
Oral polio vaccine (OPV)
OPV is the preferred vaccine for routine primary vaccination
of children 6 weeks to 18 years of age. The major advantages
of OPV are that it produces local immunity, is easily admin-
istered, and immunity is probably lifelong. In addition,
because of shedding of vaccine virus in the stool, it spreads to
susceptible household and community contacts and inter-
feres with intestinal infection with wild virus before any
antibody response is seen (this is most important in outbreak
settings). Disadvantages of OPV are that the other enterovi-
ruses and other polioviruses in the vaccine may interfere
with development of immunity to all three types, and that
there is a risk of paralytic disease if OPV is given to an
immunodeﬁcient person. There is also an extremely small
risk of contact and recipient paralytic disease in otherwise
healthy persons.
Primary immunization with OPV requires three doses,
beginning as early as 6 weeks of age. Doses are generally
given at 2-month intervals, but may be given at 6-week
intervals if necessary (e.g., if the child is behind schedule and
needs accelerated immunization).
In 1994, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) recommended lowering the routine age of the third
dose of OPV from 15-18 months to 6 months of age. Adminis-
tration of the third dose at 6 months does not significantly
reduce Seroconversion rates, and may assist in increasing
OPV coverage rates.

## p. xiii (#81) ############################################

Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV)
IPV is the preferred vaccine for vaccination of adults
(>18 years of age), children with immunodeﬁciency, and
household contacts of such immunodeﬁcient persons. The
major advantage of IPV is that it has no risk of paralytic
disease, and can be used in immunodeﬁcient persons. The
disadvantages are that it does not induce signiﬁcant local
gastrointestinal (GI) immunity. Persons given IPV are
protected from paralytic disease but may be infected with
wild poliovirus, and may shed virus in their stools. In addi-
tion, IPV is more expensive than OPV, and requires an
injection.
IPV is administered in a primary series of three doses. The
ﬁrst dose is generally given at 2 months of age, but may be
given as early as 6 weeks of age. The ﬁrst and second doses
are usually separated by 2 months, but may be separated by
as little as 4 weeks if necessary. The third dose is given
6-12 months after the second dose.
Serocon version rates
After a primary series of three doses of OPV, seroconversion
to all three types is 90%-95%. After a primary series of three
doses of IPV, seroconversion to all three types is approxi-
mately 95%-100%.
Protective efficacy
Both OPV and the current IPV have been estimated to have
a clinical efﬁcacy of virtually 100% in a developed country
setting (IPV before 1968 was less effective and was estimated
to be 80% in the 1954 ﬁeld trials.)
Duration of immunity
Three properly spaced doses of OPV should confer lifelong
immunity, but a one-time booster dose may be recommended
for adults who are at high risk of exposure to poliovirus.
Booster doses of IPV may be necessary, but the need for such
doses has not been established.
Vaccination of Adults
Routine vaccination of adults (> 18 years of age) who reside in
the United States is not necessary because most adults are
already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to
poliovirus in the United States.

Some adults (>18 years of age) are at increased risk of infec-
tion with poliovirus. These include travelers to areas where
poliomyelitis is endemic or epidemic, laboratory workers
handling specimens which may contain polioviruses, and
health care workers in close contact with patients who may
be excreting polioviruses. In addition, members of speciﬁc
population groups with a current disease caused by wild
polioviruses (e.g., during an outbreak), are also at increased
risk.
The following are the recommendations for vaccination of
adults in the above categories depending upon the previous
vaccination history and the time available before protection
is required.
Unvaccinated adults
For adults at increased risk of exposure to poliomyelitis,
primary immunization with IPV is recommended whenever
feasible. IPV is preferred because the risk of vaccine-associ-
ated paralysis following OPV is slightly higher in adults
than in children. The recommended schedule is two doses
given at 1- to 2-month intervals, and a third dose given 6 to
12 months later.
In circumstances where time will not allow completion of this
schedule (e.g., impending travel), the following alternatives
are recommended.
If less than 3 months, but more than 2 months are
available before protection is needed, three doses of IPV
should be given at least 1 month apart.
If 1-2 months are available before protection is needed,
two doses of IPV should be given at least 1 month apart.
If less than 1 month is available before protection is
needed, a single dose of either OPV or IPV is recommended.
In all instances, the remaining doses of vaccine should be
given later, at the recommended intervals, if the person
remains at increased risk.
Adults previously given a complete primary course of
OPV or IPV
Adults who are at increased risk of exposure to poliomyelitis
and who have previously completed a primary course of OPV
may be given another dose of OPV. The need for further
supplementary doses has not been established. Those adults
who previously completed a primary course of IPV may be
given a dose of either IPV or OPV.


## p. xv (#83) ##############################################

incompletely immunized adults
Adults who are at increased risk of exposure to poliomyelitis
and who have previously received less than a full primary
course of OPV or IPV should be given the remaining required
doses of either vaccine, regardless of the interval since the
last dose and type of vaccine previously received. It is not
necessary to restart the series of either vaccine if the sched-
ule has been interrupted.
Households of children receiving OPV
Adults who have not been adequately immunized against
poliomyelitis with OPV or IPV are at a very small risk of
developing OPV-associated paralytic poliomyelitis when
children in the household are given OPV. About three such
cases have occurred annually among contacts since 1969,
during which time about 24 million doses of OPV were
distributed yearly.
Because of the overriding importance of ensuring prompt and
complete immunization of the child and the extreme rarity of
OPV-associated disease in contacts, the ACIP recommends
the administration of OPV to a child regardless of the polio-
virus-vaccine status of adult household contacts. This is the
usual practice in the United States. The adult should be
informed of the small risk involved, and instructed on the
method for preventing fecal-oral transmission of vaccine
virus, particularly handwashing after changing diapers. An
acceptable alternative, if there is strong assurance that
ultimate, full immunization of the child will not be jeopar-
dized or unduly delayed, is to immunize adults according to
the schedule outlined above before giving OPV to the child.
Contraindications to Vaccination
Serious allergic reaction to a vaccine component, or following
a prior dose of vaccine, is a contraindication to further doses
of that vaccine. Since IPV contains trace amounts of strepto-
mycin and neomycin, there is a possibility of hypersensitivity
reactions in individuals sensitive to these antibiotics. Per-
sons with anaphylactic hypersensitivity, hives, etc., should
not receive IPV. Persons with allergies that are not anaphy-
lactic, such as skin contact sensitivity, may be vaccinated.
Moderate to severe illness is a temporary contraindication to
both IPV and OPV. However, mild illness, including mild
diarrhea, is not a contraindication.

tuted for OPV in these circumstances.
In general, neither OPV ner IPV should be given to pregnant
women unless immediate protection is needed (in which case
OPV is the vaccine of choice).
Adverse Events Following Vaccination
OPV
Since 1979, all paralytic poliomyelitis in the United States
has been due to vaccine-type virus. During 1980-1991, an
average of seven cases per year was reported, for an overall
risk of one case per approximately 2.5 million doses of OPV
distributed. Most cases occur in healthy recipients (35%)
and their contacts (35%). Vaccine-associated paralytic
poliomyelitis (VAPP) is more likely to occur in immunodeﬁ-
cient persons, and with the ﬁrst dose of vaccine. Other than
efforts to identify persons with immune deﬁciency condi-
tions, no procedures are currently available for identifying
persons likely to experience such adverse reactions. Al-
though the risk of vaccine-associated paralysis is extremely
small, vaccinees and their susceptible close personal contacts
should be informed of this risk.
IPV
No serious adverse events following vaccination with the
currently available IPV have been documented.
Storage and Handling
OPV
The vaccine should arrive frozen on dry ice. It should be
maintained at a temperature of 0°C (32°F) or lower and may
be in either a frozen or liquid state. Unopened vaccine may
be thawed and refrozen for a maximum of 10 freeze-thaw
cycles, if the total cumulative duration of thaw does not
exceed 24 hours and provided the temperature does not
exceed 8°C (46°F) during the period of the thaw. Unopened
vaccine may be used for up to 30 days if stored between 2°-
8°C (35°-46°F). Opened multiple-dose vaccine can be used
for up to 7 days if stored at 2°-8°C. The vaccine should be
pink or red in color.


## p. xvii (#85) ############################################

POLIOMYELITIS
IPV
The vaccine may be shipped without refrigeration provided it
is delivered within 4 days. It should be maintained at 2°-8°C
(35°-46°F). The vaccine should be perfectly clear and color-
less. Any vaccine showing particulate matter, turbidity, or
change in color, should be discarded.
Outbreak investigation and control
Collect preliminary clinical and epidemiological information
(including vaccine history and contact with OPV vaccines) on
any suspected case of paralytic polio. Notify the National
Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention ([404] 639-8255) after all appropriate local and
state health authorities have been notiﬁed. Intensify ﬁeld
investigation to verify information and collect appropriate
specimens for viral isolates and serology.
Even one case of paralytic poliomyelitis demands immediate
attention. If the evidence indicates vaccine-associated dis-
ease, then no outbreak control program is needed. If, how-
ever, evidence indicates wild virus (for example, two cases in
a community), then all unvaccinated individuals in the
epidemic area who are over 6 weeks of age and whose vac-
cine histories are uncertain should begin a course of OPV,
unless it is contraindicated.
Polio eradication
The last case of poliomyelitis in the United States was docu-
mented in 1979. The last case in the Western Hemisphere
occurred in Peru in August 1991. On September 29, 1994,
the International Commission for the Certiﬁcation of Polio-
myelitis Eradication in the Americas certiﬁed that wild
poliovirus transmission had been interrupted in the Ameri-
cas. Global eradication of polio is targeted for the Year 2000.
The number of cases of paralytic poliomyelitis reported
worldwide has been declining steadily since 1980. In 1993,
a provisional total of 9,700 cases were reported to the World
Health Organization. The majority of cases have been
reported from the Southeast Asia and Western Paciﬁc
regions.
Post-Polio Syndrome
After an interval of 30-40 years, some persons (25%-40%)
who contracted paralytic poliomyelitis in childhood may
experience new muscle pain and exacerbation of existing
weakness, or develop new weakness or paralysis. This
disease entity is referred to as post-polio syndrome. Factors
which enhance the risk of post-polio syndrome include

Chapter
Measles
EASLES IS AN ACUTE VIRAL INFECTIOUS DISEASE.
M There are references to measles as far back as the 7th
century AD. The disease was described by Rhazes in
the 10th Century AD. as “more dreaded than smallpox.”
In 1846, Panum described the incubation period of measles
and lifelong immunity. Enders and Peebles isolated the
virus in human and monkey kidney tissue culture in 1954.
The ﬁrst live attenuated vaccine was licensed for use in the
US. in 1963 (Edmonston B strain).
Measles Virus
The measles virus is a paramyxovirus, genus Morbillivirus.
It is 100 to 200mm in diameter, with a core of single-stranded
RNA, and is closely related to the rinderpest and canine
distemper viruses. Measles virus has six structural proteins,
of which three are complexed to the RNA and three are
associated with the viral membrane envelope. Two of the
membrane envelope proteins are most important in patho-
genesis. They are (1) F (fusion): glycosylated; responsible for
fusion of virus and host cell membranes, viral penetration,
and hemolysis and (2) H (hemagglutinin): glycosylated;
responsible for adsorption of virus to cells and provides
antigen for hemagglutination.
There is only one antigenic type of measles virus. Although
recent studies have documented changes in the H glycopro-
tein, these changes do not appear to be epidemiologically
important (i.e., no change in vaccine efﬁcacy has been ob-
served).
Measles virus is rapidly inactivated by heat, light, acidic pH,
ether, and trypsin, is destroyed in the stomach, and has a
short survival time (<2 hours) in the air, or on objects and
surfaces.

Measles
Clinical Course

J
Pathogenesis
Measles is a systemic infection. The primary site of infection
is the respiratory epithelium of the nasopharynx. Two to
three days after invasion and replication in the respiratory
epithelium and regional lymph nodes, a primary viremia
occurs with subsequent infection of the reticuloendothelial
system. Following further viral replication in regional and
distal reticuloendothelial sites, there is a second viremia,
which occurs 5 to 7 days after initial infection. During this
viremia, there may be infection of the respiratory tract and
other organs. Measles virus is shed from the nasopharynx
beginning with the prodrome until 3-4 days after rash onset.
Clinical Features
Incubation period
From exposure to prodrome averages 10-12 days. From
exposure to rash onset averages 14 days (range, 7-18 days).
Prodrome
The prodrome lasts 2-4 days (range 1-7 days). It is charac-
terized by fever, which increases in stepwise fashion, often
peaking as high as 103°-105°F. This is followed by the onset
of cough, coryza (runny nose), and-or conjunctivitis.
Koplik’s spots, an exanthem present on mucous membranes,
is considered to be pathognomonic for measles. It occurs
1-2 days before rash to 1-2 days after rash, and appears as
punctate blue-white spots on bright red background on
buccal mucosa.
Rash
The measles rash is a maculopapular eruption which usually
lasts 5-6 days. It begins at the hairline, then involves the
face and upper neck. Over the next 3 days, the rash gradu-
ally proceeds downward and outward, reaching the hands
and feet.
The maculopapular lesions are generally discrete, but may
become conﬂuent, particularly on the upper body. Initially,
lesions blanch with ﬁngertip pressure. By 3-4 days, most do
not blanch with pressure. Fine desquamation occurs over
more severely involved areas. The rash fades in the same
order that it appears, from head to feet.
Other symptoms and signs
Other symptoms of measles include anorexia, diarrhea,
especially in infants, and generalized lymphadenopathy.

MEASLES
Complications
Approximately 30% of reported measles cases have one or
more complications. Complications of measles are more
common among children <5 and adults >20 years of age.
Diarrhea
From 1985 through 1992, diarrhea was reported in 8% of
reported cases, making this the most commonly reported
complication of measles.
Otitis media
Otitis media is reported in 7% of reported cases, and occurs
almost exclusively in children.
Pneumonia
Pneumonia (6% of reported cases) may be viral or superim-
posed bacterial, and is the most common cause of death.
Encephalitis
Acute encephalitis is reported in approximately 0.1% of
reported cases. Onset generally occurs 6 days after rash
onset (range 1-15 days), and is characterized by fever, head-
ache, vomiting, stiff neck, meningeal irritation, drowsiness,
convulsions, and coma. Cerebrospinal ﬂuid shows
pleocytosis and elevated protein. Case fatality rate is ap-
proximately 15%. Some form of residual neurologic damage
occurs in as many as 25%.
Seizures
Seizures (with or without fever) are reported in 0.6% to 0.7%
of reported cases.
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE)
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare degen-
erative central nervous system disease believed to be due to
persistent measles virus infection of the brain. Average
onset occurs 7 years after measles (range 1 month-
27 years), and occurs in ﬁve to ten cases per million reported
measles cases. The onset is insidious, with progressive
deterioration of behavior and intellect, followed by ataxia
(awkwardness), myoclonic seizures, and eventually death.

Measles during pregnancy
Measles during pregnancy results in a higher risk of prema-
turity and spontaneous abortion. Birth defects (with no
deﬁnable pattern of malformation) have been reported
rarely, without conﬁrmation that measles was the cause.
Death
Death from measles has been reported in approximately
1-2 per 1,000 reported cases in the United States in recent
years. As with other complications of measles, the risk of
death is higher among young children and adults. Pneumo-
nia accounts for about 60% of deaths. The most common
causes of death are pneumonia in children and acute en-
cephalitis in adults.
Other Measles Syndromes
Atypical measles
This syndrome occurs only in persons who are exposed to
natural measles after they received killed measles vaccine
(KMV). Between 600,000 and 900,000 persons received KMV
in the US. from 1963 to 1967. KMV sensitized the recipient
to measles virus antigens without providing protection.
Subsequent infection with measles virus leads to signs of
hypersensitivity polyserositis. The illness is characterized
by fever, pneumonia, pleural effusions, and edema.
The rash is usually maculopapular or petechial but may have
urticarial, purpuric, or vesicular components and appears
ﬁrst on the wrists or ankles. Atypical measles may be pre-
vented by revaccinating with live measles vaccine. Moderate
to severe local reactions with or without fever may follow
vaccination; these reactions are less severe than with infec-
tion with wild measles virus.
Modified measles
This syndrome occurs primarily in patients who received
immune globulin (IG) as post-exposure prophylaxis and in
young infants who have some residual maternal antibody. It
is usually characterized by a prolonged incubation period,
mild prodrome, and sparse, discrete rash of short duration.
Similar mild illness has been reported among previously
vaccinated persons.


## p. xxiii (#91) ###########################################

Hemorrhagic measles
Rarely reported in the United States, hemorrhagic measles is
characterized by high fever (105°-106°F), seizures, delirium,
respiratory distress, and hemorrhage into the skin and
mucous membranes.
Measles in the immunocompromised host
Measles in an immunocompromised person may be severe,
with a prolonged course. It is reported almost exclusively in
persons with T-cell deﬁciencies (certain leukemias,
lymphomas, and Acquired Immunodeﬁciency Syndrome
[AIDS]). It may occur without typical rash, and a patient
may shed virus for several weeks after the acute illness.
Measles in developing countries
In developing countries, measles may result in high attack
rates among children <12 months of age. Measles is more
severe in malnourished children, particularly those with
vitamin A deﬁciency. Complications include diarrhea, dehy-
dration, stomatitis, inability to feed, and bacterial infections
(skin and elsewhere). The case fatality rate may be as high
as 25%. Measles is also a leading cause of blindness in
African children.
Differential Diagnosis
Infectious diseases
Rubella
No conjunctivitis or cough; symptoms milder; rash duration
shorter; rash ﬁne and discrete, not conﬂuent or blotchy, no
desquamation; lymphadenopathy often present; subclinical
infection common.
Scarlet fever
Rash begins within 12-14 hours of onset of fever and sore
throat; no conjunctivitis, coryza, or cough; cheeks involved
with circumoral pallor; body diffusely involved, rash punc-
tate, not blotchy, with “sandpaper” texture, most dense in
skin folds; throat culture positive for Group A, beta-
hemolytic streptococci.
Roseola (exanthem subitum)
Usually 3-4 days prodrome of high fever and irritability;
temperature falls as discrete rosy red maculopapular rash
starts, lasting 2 days.

Enteroviral infections
Marked respiratory symptoms are usually absent; rash
variable; usually occur during summer and autumn months.
Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLNS,
Kawasaki syndrome)
Prodrome is nonspeciﬁc febrile illness with sore throat;
respiratory symptoms not prominent; palms and soles promi-
nently involved with swelling and redness; dryness with
erythema of lips, mouth, tongue, and conjunctiva; desquama-
tion most prominent on palms and soles.
Others - Toxoplasmosis; staphylococcal scalded skin syn-

meningococcemia; toxic-shock syndrome.
Drug reactions
Antibiotics
Especially amoxicillin, other penicillins, cephalosporins,
sulfonamides (most frequent).
Anticonvulsants
Rash has been reported with use of phenobarbital and
phenytoin (Dilantin). The diffuse rash usually occurs within
a few days to weeks after starting treatment. Usually, the
rash is not accompanied by respiratory symptoms.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Viral isolation
Although the virus can be cultured from respiratory secre-
tions, tears, or urine, viral isolation is difﬁcult and not often
used for laboratory diagnosis. If viral isolation is attempted,
specimens should be taken prior to or soon after rash onset.


## p. xxv (#93) #############################################

Serology
Measles is usually conﬁrmed by documenting a signiﬁcant
rise in IgG antibody titer or by the presence of measles-
speciﬁc IgM antibodies in a single serum specimen. Assays
used for detection of measles antibodies include neutraliza-
tion, hemagglutination inhibition, complement ﬁxation,
immunoﬂuorescence and enzyme immunoassay (EIA). EIA
is the most common assay currently in use and is commer-
cially available. IgM antibodies appear with or soon after
rash onset, peak 1 to 2 weeks later, and fall to non-detectable
levels about 1 month after appearance of the rash. IgG
antibodies are usually detectable within 2 weeks of rash
onset in primary infections and peak 4 to 6 weeks later.
Classification of Measles Cases
Clinical classification of measles cases
A suspect case is any rash illness with fever.
An international case is classiﬁed as imported from another
country if onset of rash is within 18 days of entering the
United States.
A probable case meets the measles case definition of
generalized maculopapular rash lasting 3 days, with fever
238.3°C (101°F); and cough, or coryza, or conjunctivitis.
A conﬁrmed case meets the case deﬁnition, and is epidemio-
logically linked to another conﬁrmed or probable case; or is
serologically conﬁrmed.
Only conﬁrmed cases should be reported to Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report ( MM WR), but conﬁrmed and prob-
able cases should be reported as soon as possible to local or
state health department.
Epidemiologic classification
An indigenous case is any case which cannot be proved to
be imported (or epidemiologically linked within two genera-
tions to an imported case).
An imported case is a case which has its source outside the
state. To classify a case as imported requires documentation
that the person either had face-to-face contact with a case of
measles outside the state, or was out of state for the entire
period when he or she might have become infected.

Epidemiology
Occurrence
Measles occurs throughout the world.
Reservoir
Measles is a human disease. There is no known animal
reservoir, and an asymptomatic carrier state has not been
documented.
Transmission
Measles transmission is primarily person to person via large
respiratory droplets. Airborne transmission via aerosolized
droplet nuclei has been documented in closed areas (e.g.,
ofﬁce examination room) for up to 2 hours after a person
with measles occupied the area.
Temporal pattern
In temperate areas, measles disease occurs primarily in the
late winter and spring.
Communicability
Measles is highly communicable, with >90% secondary
attack rates among susceptible persons. Measles may be
transmitted from 4 days prior to 4 days after rash onset.
Maximum Communicability occurs from onset of prodrome
through the ﬁrst 3-4 days of rash.
Secular Trends in the United States
Before 1963, approximately 500,000 cases and 500 deaths
were reported annually with epidemic cycles every 2-3 years.
However, the actual number of cases was estimated at
3-4 million annually. More than 50% of persons had measles
by age 6 and more than 90% had measles by age 15. Highest
incidence was in 5-9 year-olds, who generally accounted for
more than 50% of reported cases.
Following licensure of vaccine in 1963, the incidence of
measles decreased by more than 98%, and 2-3 year epidemic
cycles no longer occurred. Because of this success, a 1978
Measles Elimination Program set a goal to eliminate
indigenous measles by October 1, 1982 (26,871 cases were
reported in 1978). The 1983 elimination goal was not met,
but in 1983, only 1,497 cases were reported (0.6 cases per
100,000 population), the lowest annual total ever reported up
to that time.


## p. xxvii (#95) ###########################################

MEASLES m
The incidence of measles increased annually after 1983, to
6,282 cases (26/100,000 population) in 1986, and decreased
slightly to approximately 3,500 cases (1.5 per 100,000 popu-
lation) in 1987-1988.
During 1980-1988, a median of 57% of reported cases were
among school-aged persons (5-19 years of age), and a median
of 29% were <5 years of age. A median of 8% of cases were
<1 year of age.
From 1985 through 1988, 42% of cases occurred in persons
who were vaccinated on or after their ﬁrst birthdays. During
these years, 68% of cases in school-aged children (5-19 years)
had been appropriately vaccinated. In contrast, only 16% of
cases in children 16 months to 4 years of age were appropri-
ately vaccinated. Twenty percent of cases were in persons
for whom vaccine was not routinely indicated, of which 82%
were children <16 months of age, and 31% were in unvacci-
nated persons for whom vaccine was indicated.
From 1980 through 1988, a median of two measles-associ-
ated deaths per year were reported, for a median death-to-
case ratio (DCR) of 0.64 deaths per 1,000 reported cases.
Measles resurgence in 1989-1991
In 1989 through 1991, a dramatic increase in cases occurred.
During these 3 years a total of 55,622 cases were reported
(18,193 in 1989; 27,786 in 1990; 9,643 in 1991). In addition
to the increased number of cases, a change in age distribu-
tion of cases also occurred. Prior to the resurgence, school-
aged children had accounted for the largest proportion of
reported cases. During the resurgence, 45% of all reported
cases were in children <5 years of age. In 1990, 48% of
patients were in this age group, the ﬁrst time that the pro-
portion of cases in children <5 years of age exceeded the
proportion of cases in 5-19-year-olds. Thirty-ﬁve percent of
cases were among school-aged persons (5-19 years old).
Children <12 months of age accounted for 16% of all reported
cases. In 1991, 19% of all reported cases were <12 months of
age, the highest proportion of cases in this age group ever
reported.
Measles incidence increased in all age groups, but increased
the most in children <1 year and 1-4 years of age.
Overall incidence rates were highest for Hispanics and
blacks and lowest for non-Hispanic whites. Among children
<5 years of age the incidence of measles among blacks and
Hispanics was four to seven times higher than among non-
Hispanic whites.

complications, including 4941 (9%) with diarrhea, 4244 (8%)
with otitis media, 3489 (6%) with pneumonia, and 80 (0.1%)
cases of encephalitis. Twenty percent of reported cases
required hospitalization for a total of at least 44,000 hospital
days. The estimated direct medical cost of the 1989-1991
measles resurgence was >$150 million.
A provisional total of 136 measles-associated deaths were
reported (death-to-case ratio = 2.5 per 1,000 cases). Sixty-six
(49%) reported deaths were among children <5 years of age,
including 28 (21%) <1 year of age. Twenty-eight percent of
deaths were in adults >20 years of age. Ninety percent of
fatal cases had no history of vaccination. Sixty-four deaths
were reported in 1990, the largest number of deaths from
measles reported in 1 year since 1971.
Measles outbreaks
Measles outbreaks are classiﬁed into two major types based
on the predominant age group affected. “Preschool” and
“school-aged” outbreaks are those in which children <5 and
persons 5-19 years of age, respectively, account for the great-
est number of cases.
Preschool outbreaks involve predominantly unvaccinated
children <5 years of age. In contrast, outbreaks among
school-aged children involve highly vaccinated populations.
In some large school-aged outbreaks, over 95 percent of cases
have occurred in persons with histories of vaccination on or
after their ﬁrst birthday (i.e. , because of vaccine failure).
Between 1985 and 1988, 55 to 110 outbreaks occurred annu-
ally in the United States, and the major pattern was of
outbreaks in highly vaccinated school-aged populations. An
annual median of 47 school-aged outbreaks occurred, six of
which involved >100 persons. These outbreaks accounted for
a median of 51% of all reported measles cases.
From 1985-1988, transmission among preschool children was
limited, with a median of eight preschool-type outbreaks
occurring annually, and only one outbreak per year involving
>100 persons. Preschool outbreaks accounted for an annual
median of 20% of reported cases during this time.
In 1989-1990, both the number and size of outbreaks in-
creased, and preschool-type outbreaks became more promi-
nent. In 1989 and 1990, a total of 248 and 240 outbreaks,
respectively, were reported, and 45% and 72% of all cases,
respectively, were reported from preschool outbreaks. Only
32% and 10%, respectively, occurred among school-aged
outbreaks.


## p. xxix (#97) ############################################

In 1989-1991, large preschool outbreaks occurred in several
inner city areas, including Los Angeles, Houston, Milwaukee,
Chicago, Dallas, New York City, and Philadelphia. In these
outbreaks, the majority of cases occurred among
unvaccinated black and Hispanic children.
Causes of the 1989-1991 resurgence of measles
The most important cause of the measles resurgence of 1989-
1991 was low vaccination coverage. Measles vaccine cover-
age was low in many cities, including some which experi-
enced large outbreaks among preschool-aged children,
throughout the early to mid-1980s. Surveys in areas experi-
encing preschool-type measles outbreaks indicated that as
few as 50% of children had been vaccinated against measles
by their second birthdays, and that black and Hispanic
children were less likely to be age-appropriately vaccinated
than white children.
Measles susceptibility of infants less than one year of age
may have increased. During the 1989-1991 measles resur-
gence, incidence rates for infants were more than twice as
high as those in any other age group. The mothers of many
infants who developed measles were young, and their
measles immunity was most often due to vaccination rather
than infection with wild virus. As a result, a smaller amount
of antibody was transferred across the placenta to the fetus,
compared with antibody transfer from mothers who had
higher antibody titers that resulted from wild virus infection.
The lower quantity of antibody resulted in immunity that
waned more rapidly, making infants susceptible at a younger
age today than infants were in the past.
The increase in measles in 1989-1991 was not limited to the
United States. Large outbreaks of measles were reported by
many other countries of North and Central America, includ-
ing Canada, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica,
Mexico, and Nicaragua. The cause of this continent-wide
increase in measles activity is not known.
The increase in measles was not caused by a major change in
the measles virus or decrease in effectiveness of the vaccine.
Vaccine-induced measles antibodies still provided a high
degree of neutralizing activity against the current strains of
measles virus, and high clinical efﬁcacy. For example, a
1990 study in California determined a single dose of measles
vaccine to be 95% efﬁcacious in preventing measles among
preschool-aged children.

Measles in 1992 and 1993
A total of 2,237 measles cases were reported in 1992.
Twenty-four percent of reported cases were among children
<12 months of age; 50% of reported cases were among chil-
dren <5 years of age. As in 1989-1991, the largest measles
outbreak involved predominantly preschool-aged children
(Texas, 990 cases, 75% of cases <5 years of age).
In 1993 only 312 measles cases were reported, the lowest
annual total ever reported in the United States. The propor-
tion of cases among preschool-aged children decreased, and
the proportion of school-aged children increased.
The decrease in reported measles since 1992 is believed to be
primarily a result of increased efforts to vaccinate preschool-
aged children.
Measles Vaccine
Measles vaccine is a live attenuated viral vaccine. Only one
strain of measles vaccine virus (Moraten) is currently avail-
able in the United States. The vaccine is grown in chick
ﬁbroblast culture, so it contains a minute quantity of egg
protein.

MEASLES 9 7
Response to vaccination
The antibody response to live measles vaccine is similar to
the antibody response to natural disease. Seroconversion to
a single dose of measles vaccine occurs in 295% of recipients.
Antibodies begin to rise approximately 12 days after vaccina-
tion (a few days earlier than natural infection) and reach a
peak at about 1 month.
The vaccine produces both humoral and cellular immunity.
Vaccine-induced titers are generally lower than natural
infection. However, antibody persists for many years in
almost all persons. Those few who lose antibody are probably
still immune (they show secondary type responses upon
revaccination). Lifelong immunity is expected. Subclinical
reinfections may occur. There is no evidence that persons
with subclinical reinfection can transmit the virus.
Vaccine-induced infection is not communicable.
Clinical vaccine efficacy
Most studies show protection of 95% or greater in children
vaccinated at 15 months of age or older. Vaccine efﬁcacy
may be slightly lower in persons vaccinated at 12-14 months
of age, probably because of persistence of maternal antibody.
Routine childhood vaccination schedule
In 1994, the ACIP recommended routine vaccination with
measles vaccine at 12-15 months of age. The decision to
lower the routine age to 12 months was based on the obser-
vation that most children are susceptible to measles by
12 months of age, due to waning maternal antibody.
Since 1989, a routine two-dose schedule has been recom-
mended. The purpose of the second dose is to produce
measles immunity in persons who failed to respond to the
ﬁrst dose (i.e., primary vaccine failure). Studies in several
age groups indicate that >90% of persons who fail to respond
to the ﬁrst dose will respond to the second dose. It is pos-
sible that a second dose of measles vaccine could increase
(“boost”) antibody titers in persons with low levels of anti-
body at the time of vaccination. However, there are few data
to indicate whether this increase would be sustained over
time.
Both doses of measles vaccine should preferably be given as
combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR). The
second dose should be given at 4-6 years, or prior to entry to
kindergarten or ﬁrst grade. The recommended time for the
second dose is based primarily on administrative consider-
ations of ease of implementation and monitoring.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has also recom-
mended a routine two-dose schedule. These recommenda-
tions differ from the ACIP’s in that the age at second dose is
at entry into middle or junior high school rather than kinder-
garten or ﬁrst grade.
The minimum interval between two doses of measles vaccine
is 1 month. A child who receives two doses after the ﬁrst
birthday at least 1 month apart does not need additional
doses at school entry. A child who has received no measles
vaccine at school entry should receive the ﬁrst dose at school
entry and a second dose at least 1 month later.
Vaccination of other groups
Colleges and other educational institutions post-high
school
Routine enforcement of a two-dose measles policy has been
shown to signiﬁcantly decrease the risk of measles outbreaks
on college campuses. All students should have documenta-
tion of receipt of two doses of measles vaccine after the ﬁrst
birthday or other evidence of measles immunity at the time
of entry.
Medical personnel
Health care workers are at high risk for measles. All new
employees should be required to have documentation of
receipt of two doses of measles vaccine after the ﬁrst birth-
day or other evidence of measles immunity. If resources
allow, these requirements should be extended to all
employees.
International travelers
Many measles cases imported from other countries are
among US. citizens who return from international travel.
Travelers to areas where measles is endemic or where out-
breaks are occurring should have documentation of receipt of
two doses of measles vaccine after the first birthday, or other
evidence of measles immunity.
Revaccination
The following groups of persons should be considered unvac-
cinated and should receive at least one dose of measles
vaccine. Those (1) vaccinated before the ﬁrst birthday,
(2) vaccinated with killed measles vaccine (KMV), (3) vacci-
nated with KMV followed by live vaccine less than 4 months
after the last dose of KMV, (4) vaccinated prior to 1968 with
an unknown type of vaccine (the vaccine may have been
KMV), (5) or vaccinated with IG in addition to a further
attenuated strain or vaccine of unknown type (revaccination
not necessary if IG was given with Edmonston B vaccine).


## p. xxxiii (#101) #########################################

Post-exposure prophylaxis
Live measles vaccine provides permanent protection and
may prevent disease if given within 72 hours of exposure.
Immune globulin (IG) may prevent or modify disease and
provide temporary protection if given within 6 days of expo-
sure. The dose is 0.25 ml-kg body weight, maximum 15 ml
intramuscularly. IG may be especially indicated for suscep-
tible household contacts of measles patients, particularly
contacts <1 year of age (for whom the risk of complications is
highest). Live measles vaccine should be given about
5 months later when the passive measles antibodies should
have disappeared, if the child is then 12 months of age or
older. IG should not be used to control measles outbreaks.
Adverse Events Following Vaccination
Adverse events following measles vaccine represent replica-
tion of measles vaccine virus with subsequent mild illness
(except allergic reactions). These events occur 5-12 days
postvaccination. The most common are fever (5%-15%) and
rash (5%).
Based on data from Sweden and Finland, the Institute of
Medicine has recently concluded that a causal association
exists between measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and
thrombocytopenia, approximately once in 30,000 to 40,000
doses. The decrease in platelet count is presumably due to
the measles vaccine virus component, and is not usually
clinically apparent. However, thrombocytopenic purpura
following vaccination has been reported.
Neurologic reactions following measles vaccination have
been reported approximately once per million doses distrib-
uted (compared with 1 per 1,000 for natural measles). These
events represent a temporal association. Vaccine has never
been proven to cause such reactions.
Contraindications to Vaccination
Persons with a history of anaphylaxis following exposure
to eggs or neomycin should be vaccinated with extreme
caution, and only in a setting where anaphylaxis can be
appropriately managed. Protocols have been published for
vaccination of egg-allergic persons.
Persons with moderate to severe illness should not be
vaccinated until the illness has resolved. This precaution is
intended to prevent complicating the management of an ill
patient with a potential vaccine adverse event, such as fever.

recovery from other illness are not contraindications to
measles vaccination. One recent study suggested that
Seroconversion to measles vaccine was reduced in children
with upper respiratory infections. However, multiple previ-
ous and subsequent studies have not conﬁrmed this ﬁnding.
Persons with impaired immune systems resulting from
leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, immune
deﬁciency disease, or immunosuppressive therapy should not
be vaccinated. However, treatment with low dose (<2 mg-kg/
day), alternate day, topical, or aerosolized steroid prepara-
tions is not a contraindication to measles vaccination. Per-
sons whose immunosuppressive therapy with steroids or
chemotherapeutic agents has been stopped for 3 month may
be vaccinated. See Appendix B for more information on
vaccination of immunodeﬁcient persons.
Pregnant women should not receive measles vaccine.
Pregnancy should be avoided for 1 month following receipt of
measles vaccine and 3 months if given as combined MMR
vaccine.
Receipt of antibody-containing blood products
(e.g., immune globulin, whole blood or packed red blood cells,
intravenous immune globulin) may interfere with
Seroconversion to measles vaccine. The length of time that
such passively acquired antibody persists depends on the
concentration and quantity of blood product received. For
instance, vaccination is recommended to be delayed for
3 months following receipt of immune globulin for prophy-
laxis of hepatitis A, but a 7 -11 month delay is recommended
following administration of intravenous immune globulin,
depending on the dose — see Table 8 in theACIP's 1994
General Recommendations on Immunization (included in
Appendix A).
Infection with HIV
Measles disease may be severe in symptomatic HIV-infected
persons. No serious or unusual adverse events have been
documented in limited studies of measles immunization in
both asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV-infected children.
As a result, asymptomatic HIV-infected children should
receive measles vaccine at the recommended ages. Measles
vaccine should also be considered for all symptomatic HIV-
infected children. Testing for HIV infection of asymptomatic
children who come for vaccination is not necessary before
decisions concerning vaccination are made. HIV-infected
adults should also be considered for measles vaccine if they
are believed to be susceptible (i.e., no history of measles
vaccination or measles disease).

Mumps
UMPS IS AN ACUTE VIRAL ILLNESS. ALTHOUGH THE
M parotitis and orchitis were described by Hippocrates in
the 5th century BC, until relatively recently
mumps was viewed primarily as an illness which affected
armies during times of mobilization.
In 1934, Johnson and Goodpasture showed that mumps
could be transmitted from infected patients to rhesus mon-
keys and demonstrated that mumps was caused by a
ﬁltrable agent present in saliva. This agent was later shown
to be a virus.
Mumps Virus
Mumps virus is a paramyxovirus in the same group as
inﬂuenza, parainﬂuenza and Newcastle disease virus.
Parainﬂuenza and Newcastle disease viruses produce anti-
bodies that cross-react with mumps virus. The virus has a
single-stranded RNA genome.
The virus can be isolated or propagated in cultures of various
human and monkey tissues and in embryonated eggs. It has
been recovered from the saliva, cerebrospinal ﬂuid, urine,
blood, milk, and infected tissues of patients with mumps.
The virus causes generalized disease.
The virus is rapidly inactivated by heat, formalin, ether,
chloroform, and ultraviolet light.

Pathogenesis
The virus is acquired by respiratory droplets. The virus
replicates in the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes.
After 12-25 days a Viremia occurs which lasts from 3 to
5 days. During the Viremia, the virus spreads to multiple
tissues, including the meninges, and glands such as the
salivary, testes, pancreas, and ovaries. Inﬂammation in
infected tissues leads to characteristic symptoms of parotitis
and aseptic meningitis.
Clinical Features
The incubation period of mumps is 14-18 days (range,
14-25 days).
The prodromal symptoms are nonspeciﬁc, and include
myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-grade fever.
Up to one-third of infected persons have minimal or no
manifestations of disease.
Parotitis is the most common manifestation, and occurs in
30%-40% of infected persons. Parotitis may be unilateral or
bilateral and any combination of single or multiple salivary
glands may be affected. Parotitis tends to occur within the
ﬁrst 2 days and may ﬁrst be noted as earache and tenderness
on palpation of the angle of the jaw. Symptoms tend to
decrease after 1 week and are usually gone by 10 days.
Up to 20% of mumps infections are asymptomatic. An addi-
tional 40%-50% may have only nonspeciﬁc or primarily
respiratory symptoms.
Complications
Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in the form of
aseptic meningitis is common, occurring asymptomatically
(inﬂammatory cells in cerebrospinal ﬂuid) in 50%-60% of
patients. Symptomatic meningitis (headache, stiff neck)
occurs in up to 15% of patients and resolves without sequelae
in 3-10 days. Adults are at higher risk for this complication
than children, and boys are more commonly affected than
girls (3:1 ratio). Parotitis may be absent in up to 50% of such
patients. Encephalitis is rare (<0.2/ 1,000) and permanent
sequelae or death is uncommon.


## p. xxxvii (#105) #########################################

Orchitis (testicular inﬂammation) is the most common
complication in postpubertal males. It occurs in up to 20%-
50% of postpubertal males, usually after parotitis, but may
precede it, begin simultaneously, or occur alone. It is bilat-
eral in up to 30% of affected males. There is usually abrupt
onset of testicular swelling, tenderness, nausea, vomiting,
and fever. Pain and swelling may subside in 1 week, but
tenderness may last for weeks. Approximately 50% of pa-
tients with orchitis have some degree of testicular atrophy,
but sterility is rare.
Deafness caused by mumps is one of the leading causes of
acquired sensorineural deafness in childhood. The estimated
incidence is approximately 1 per 20,000 reported cases of
mumps. Hearing loss is unilateral in approximately 80% of
cases and may be associated with vestibular reactions.
Onset is usually sudden and results in permanent hearing
impairment.
Oophoritis (ovarian inﬂammation) occurs in 5% of
postpubertal females. It may mimic appendicitis. There is
no relationship to impaired fertility. Pancreatitis is infre-
quent, but occasionally occurs without parotitis; the
hyperglycemia is transient and is reversible. While some
single instances of diabetes mellitus have been reported, a
causal relationship has yet to be conclusively demonstrated;
many cases of temporal association have been described both
in siblings and individuals, and outbreaks of diabetes have
been reported a few months or years after outbreaks of
mumps.
Electrocardiogram (EKG) changes compatible with myo-
carditis are seen in 23%-15% of patients with mumps, but
symptomatic involvement is rare. Complete recovery is the
rule, but deaths have been reported.
There is no good evidence to support intrauterine infection
with mumps as a cause of endocardial ﬁbroelastosis or other
congenital malformations. Increased fetal wastage, how-
ever, has been reported in pregnancies complicated by
mumps.
In some young adults, particularly males, monarticular
arthritis, migratory polyarthritis, or arthralgia occur at
about 2 weeks after onset; usually the larger joints are
affected. Symptoms last from days up to 3 months, but
resolution is spontaneous and complete. Joint damage has
not been reported.
Viruria is common in mumps infection. This may be accom-
panied by abnormal renal function tests and rarely by
nephritis, which has sometimes been fatal.


## p. xxxviii (#106) ########################################

MUM...
Other manifestations, such as hematological reactions (e.g.,
leukemoid reaction and paroxysmal nocturnal hemo-
globinuria) and other gland involvement (e.g., thyroid,
lacrimal, prostate, and breast) have been reported infre-
quently.
Deaths from mumps are infrequent; 1-3.4 deaths per 10,000
reported cases in recent years.
Differential Diagnosis
Possible causes of parotid gland swelling include drug ef-
fects, metabolic diseases (usually bilateral), systemic dis-
eases (e.g., lupus), viral infections (parainﬂuenza types 1 and
3, Coxsackie, inﬂuenza type A), bacterial infections, and
parotid duct obstruction by stone or tumor. A cluster of cases
of parotitis is very suggestive of mumps since most other
etiologies do not result in epidemic parotitis.
Clues to diagnosis include ongoing mumps activity in the
community, history of exposure to mumps, bilateral involve-
ment, and associated symptoms.
Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of mumps is usually suspected based on clini-
cal manifestations, in particular the presence of parotitis.
Viral isolation
Mumps virus can be isolated from clinical specimens, includ-
ing saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid. If virus isolation is
attempted, specimens should be collected within the first
5 days of illness.
Serology
Complement fixation (CF) and hemagglutination inhibition
(HI) antibody tests for mumps are relatively insensitive, and
results may not be reliable. Tests that have demonstrated
reliability include neutralization, enzyme immunoassay
(EIA), and radial hemolysis antibody tests. Neutralization
assays are time consuming and not generally available for
routine diagnostic use.
The EIA is widely available commercially and is more sensi-
tive than the CF, HI, or radial hemolysis. It is available for
both IgM and IgG. IgM antibody usually becomes detectable
during the first few days of illness and reaches a peak about
a week after onset. IgG testing usually requires two
specimens separated by several weeks. The convalescent
(second) specimen should show a signiﬁcant increase in
antibody compared with the acute (first) specimen.

Case Definition
K Mumps Case Definition \
The clinical case deﬁnition of mumps is an acute onset of
unilateral or bilateral swelling of the parotid or salivary
gland lasting >2 days without other apparent cause.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Mumps has been reported worldwide.
Reservoir
Mumps is a human disease. While persons with asymptom-
atic or nonclassical infection may transmit the virus, no
carrier state is known to exist.
Transmission
Transmission of mumps occurs through airborne transmis-
sion or direct contact with infected droplet nuclei or saliva.
Temporal pattern
Mumps incidence peaks predominantly in winter-spring, but
is endemic year-round.
Communicability
Contagiousness is similar to that of inﬂuenza and rubella,
but less than that for measles or chickenpox. The infectious
period is considered to be from 3 days before to the 4th day of
active disease; virus has been isolated from saliva 7 days
before to 9 days after onset of parotitis.
Secular Trends in the United States
Mumps became a nationally reportable disease in the United
States in 1968. However, an estimated 212,000 cases oc-
curred in the United States in 1964. Following vaccine
licensure, reported mumps decreased rapidly. Approxi-
mately 3,000 cases were reported annually in 1983-1985 (1.3-
1.55 cases per 100,000 population).
A relative resurgence occurred in 1986-1987, with reported
cases increasing to almost 13,000 in 1987. Since 1987, 3,000-
5,000 cases have been reported annually. A total of 1,692
cases was reported in 1993, the lowest number ever reported
in a year in the United States.

immunity

Prior to vaccine licensure in 1967, and during the early years
of vaccine use, most reported cases occurred in the 5-9 year
age group, which also had the highest risk of infection; 90%
of cases occurred among children under 15 years of age. In
the late 1980s, however, there was a shift towards older
children. Since 1982, 50%-80% of reported cases have oc-
curred among children 5-19 years of age. Males and females
are affected equally.
Eighty percent or more of adults in urban-suburban areas
with or without a history of mumps have serologic evidence
of immunity.
Mumps outbreaks have occurred in situations where large
numbers of children or young adults are in close contact,
such as prisons, orphanages, boarding schools, garrisons, and
ships. Armies have been affected during times of mobiliza-
tion, and hospital outbreaks also have been reported. Large
outbreaks occurred approximately every 3-7 years during the
prevaccine era.
Mumps Vaccine
Mumps virus was isolated in 1945 and an inactivated vac-
cine was developed in 1948. This vaccine produced only
short-lasting immunity, and its use was discontinued in the
mid-1970s.
Live mumps virus vaccine was attenuated in chick-embryo
tissue culture in the early 1960s. The J eryl Lynn strain of
live attenuated mumps virus vaccine was licensed in Decem-
ber 1967.
The currently used vaccine elicits antibody in over 90% of
vaccinees and produces durable, presumably lifelong, immu-
nity. The subclinical infection induced by the vaccine is not
communicable. Clinical efﬁcacy has been estimated to be
95% (range, 90%-97%).
Indications
Current recommendations are for vaccination of all infants
(without contraindications) with one dose of mumps vaccine
at 12-15 months of age. The vaccine should be administered
as combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.
All older children not previously immunized should receive
one dose of mumps vaccine as MMR.


## p. xli (#109) ############################################

Adolescents and adults who are considered susceptible
should be vaccinated. Most adults born before 1957 can be
considered immune. Susceptibility testing is not necessary
(or recommended) in persons who are unsure of their history
of mumps disease or vaccination since vaccination of immune
persons (regardless of how they became immune) is safe.
Post-exposure prophylaxis
Neither mumps immune globulin nor immune globulin (IG)
is effective postexposure prophylaxis. Vaccination after
exposure is not harmful and may possibly avert later
disease.
Adverse Events Following Vaccination
No adverse reactions were reported in large-scale ﬁeld trials.
Subsequently, parotitis and fever have been reported rarely.
A few cases of orchitis (all suspect) also have been reported.
Rare cases of CNS dysfunction, including cases of deafness,
within 2 months of mumps vaccination have been reported.
The calculated incidence of CNS reactions is approximately
one per million doses of antigen, a rate lower than the re-
ported background encephalitis rate of 2-6/ 10,000. The
Institute of Medicine (1993) concluded that evidence is
inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between
the J eryl Lynn strain of mumps vaccine and aseptic meningi-
tis, encephalitis, sensorineural deafness, or orchitis.
Allergic reactions, including rash, pruritus, and purpura
have been temporally associated with vaccination, but are
transient and generally mild. Overall, mumps vaccine is one
of the safest of the live viral vaccines.
Contraindications to Vaccination
Persons with a history of anaphylaxis following exposure to
eggs or neomycin should be vaccinated with extreme cau-
tion, and only in a setting where anaphylaxis can be appro-
priately managed. Protocols have been published for vacci-
nation of egg-allergic persons.
Persons with moderate to severe illness should not be
vaccinated until the illness has resolved. Minor illness
(e.g., otitis media, mild upper respiratory infections), concur-
rent antibiotic therapy, and exposure or recovery from other
illnesses are not contraindications to mumps vaccination.

## p. xlii (#110) ###########################################

Persons with impaired immune systems resulting from
leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, immune
deﬁciency disease, or immunosuppressive therapy should not
be vaccinated. However, treatment with low dose (<2 mg-kg/
day), alternate day, topical, or aerosolized steroid prepara-
tions is not a contraindication to mumps vaccination. Per-
sons whose immunosuppressive therapy with steroids or
chemotherapeutic agents has been stopped for 3 months may
be vaccinated.
Pregnant women should not receive mumps vaccine for
theoretic reasons. There is no evidence that mumps vaccine
virus causes fetal damage. Pregnancy should be avoided for
3 months after vaccination.
Receipt of antibody-containing blood products (e.g., immune
globulin, whole blood or packed red blood cells, intravenous
immune globulin) may interfere with Seroconversion to
mumps vaccine. Vaccine should be given 2 Weeks before, or
deferred for at least 3 months following administration of an
antibody-containing blood product.
A family history of diabetes is not a contraindication for
vaccination.
Other Issues
Targeted vaccination programs
All persons thought to be susceptible to mumps should be
vaccinated unless the vaccine is otherwise contraindicated.
This is especially important for adolescents and young
adults, in light of the recently observed shift in risk of dis-
ease to these populations.
Because of limited accessibility to some population sub-
groups, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) recommends taking maximal advantage of clinic
visits to vaccinate susceptible persons 12 months of age or
older by administering MMR (measles, mumps and rubella),
DTP (diphtheria and tetanus'toxoid and pertussis vaccine)
and OPV (oral poliovirus vaccine) simultaneously, if all are
needed. Health agencies should take necessary steps, includ-
ing the development, adoption, and enforcement of compre-
hensive immunization requirements, to ensure that all
persons in schools at all grade levels and in day-care settings
are protected against mumps.


## p. xliii (#111) ##########################################

MUMPS 109
The incidence of mumps has been consistently lower in
states that have comprehensive laws requiring proof of
immunity against mumps for school attendance (day care
through grade 12). Similar requirements should be consid-
ered for colleges and selected places of employment where
persons in this age cohort are likely to be concentrated or
where the consequences of disease spread may be more
severe (for example, health care settings).
Mumps outbreak control
In determining means to control mumps outbreaks, one
should consider exclusion of susceptible students from af-
fected schools and schools judged by local public health
authorities to be at risk of transmission. Such exclusion
should be an effective means of terminating school outbreaks
and quickly increasing rates of immunization. Excluded
students can be readmitted immediately after vaccination.
Pupils who have been exempted from mumps vaccination
because of medical, religious, or other reasons should be
excluded until at least 26 days after the onset of parotitis in
the last person with mumps in the affected school. Experi-
ence with outbreak control for other vaccine-preventable
diseases indicates that almost all students who are excluded
from the outbreak area because they lack evidence of immu-
nity quickly comply with requirements and can be readmit-
ted to school.

Rubella
HE NAME RUBELLA IS DERIVED FROM LATIN, MEANING

“little red.” It was initially considered to be a variant Rubella
of measles or scarlet fever and called “third disease.” ' From mi" meaning "little red"
It was not until 1814 that it was ﬁrst described as a , Discovered,"1mhcemury_,houghmbe
separate disease in the German medical literature. varianfof measles
In 1914, Hess postulated a viral etiology based on his work ' disﬂmmimcalenmym
with monkeys. Hire and Tosaka in 1938 conﬁrmed the viral _ _
etiology by passing the disease to children using ﬁltered ‘ 333,121,?“simmer-baby
nasal washings from acute cases.
- Pandemic in Europe and US. 1962-65
Following a widespread Australian epidemic of rubella
infection in 1940, Gregg, an Australian ophthalmologist,
reported in 1941 the occurrence of congenital cataracts
among 78 infants born following maternal rubella infection
in early pregnancy. This was the ﬁrst reported recognition of
congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).

Rubella Virus
The rubella virus is classiﬁed as a togavirus, genus


Rubivirus. It is most closely related to group A arboviruses, Rubella virus
such as Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis viruses. - Togavirus
It is an enveloped RNA virus, with a single antigenic type RNA _

- Rapidly inactivated by chemical agents,
Rubella virus is relatively unstable and is inactivated by

pH and heat, and amantadine.

Rubella virus was ﬁrst isolated in 1962 by Parkman and
Weller.

Pathogenesis
Following respiratory transmission of rubella virus,
replication of the virus is thought to occur in the nasopharynx
and regional lymph nodes. A viremia occurs 5-7 days after
exposure with spread of the virus throughout the body. In
CRS, transplacental infection of the fetus occurs during
viremia. Fetal damage occurs through destruction of cells as
well as mitotic arrest.
Clinical Features
Acquired rubella
The incubation period varies from 12 to 23 days.
Symptoms are often mild, and 30%-50% of cases may be
subclinical or inapparent.
In children, rash is usually the ﬁrst manifestation and a
prodrome is rare. In older children and adults, there is often
a 1-5 day prodrome with low-grade fever, malaise, swollen
glands, and upper respiratory infection (URI) preceding the
rash.
The rash of rubella usually occurs initially on the face and
then progresses from head to foot. It lasts about 3 days and is
occasionally pruritic. The rash is fainter than measles rash
and does not coalesce.
Lymphadenopathy may begin 1 week before the rash and last
several weeks. Postauricular, posterior cervical, and
suboccipital nodes are commonly involved.
Arthralgia and arthritis occur so frequently in adults that
they are considered by many to be an integral part of the
illness as opposed to a complication.
Other symptoms of rubella include conjunctivitis, testalgia, or
orchitis. Forschheimer spots may be noted on the soft palate,
but are not diagnostic for rubella.

RUBELLA
Complications
Complications are uncommon but tend to occur more often in
adults than in children.
Arthritis or arthralgia may occur in up to 70% of adult
women who contract rubella, but are rare in children or
adult males. Fingers, wrists, and knees tend to be affected.
Joint symptoms tend to occur about the same time or shortly
after appearance of the rash and may last for up to 1 month;
chronic arthritis is rare.
Encephalitis occurs in one in 5,000 cases, more frequently in
adults (especially in females) than in children. Mortality
estimates vary from 0 to 50%.
Hemorrhagic manifestations occur with an approximate
incidence of 1 per 3,000 cases, occurring more often in
children than in adults. These manifestations may be
secondary to low platelets and vascular damage, with
thrombocytopenic purpura being the most common
manifestation. Gastrointestinal, cerebral, or intrarenal
hemorrhage may occur. Effects may last from days to
months, and most patients recover.
Additional complications include orchitis, neuritis, and a
rare late syndrome of progressive panencephalitis.
Differential Diagnosis
Modified measles usually has a history of immune globulin
(IG) injection after measles exposure. It is also reported to
occur in previously vaccinated persons.
Scarlet fever manifests itself as a sandpaper rash,
circumoral pallor, with group A streptococci in throat.
Roseola infantum (exanthem subitum) symptoms can
include a high fever for 4-5 days, and an abrupt onset of rash
with lysis or fever.
Fifth disease (parvovirus B19 infection) can result in a
slapped cheek appearance, and a lacy reticular rash that
may recur. There are usually no systemic symptoms, but
arthralgia and-or arthritis have been reported.
Infectious mononucleosis can be similar to rubella, but
symptoms last longer. Other signs include a prominent
splenomegaly and a positive heterophile antibody test.

Enteroviruses may mimic rubella and are often associated
with aseptic meningitis. They are common in summer and
early fall.
Drug eruptions may mimic rubella. There is no prodrome,
and a drug history can be important.
Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS)
Prevention of CRS is the main objective of rubella vaccina-
tion programs in the United States.
The 1964 rubella epidemic resulted in 12.5 million cases of
rubella infection and about 20,000 newborns with CRS. The
estimated ﬁnancial cost of the epidemic was $840 million.
This does not include the emotional toll on the families
involved. The estimated lifetime cost of one case of CRS
today is estimated to be in excess of $200,000.
Rubella can be a disastrous disease in early gestation, lead-
ing to fetal death, premature delivery, and an array of con-
genital defects. Spontaneous abortion and stillbirths are
common. The severity of the effects of rubella virus on the
fetus depends largely on the time of gestation at which
infection occurs. Up to 85% of infants infected in the ﬁrst
trimester of pregnancy will be found to be affected if followed
after birth. While fetal infection may occur throughout
pregnancy, defects are rare when infection occurs after the
20th Week of gestation. The overall risk of defects during the
third trimester is probably no greater than that associated
with uncomplicated pregnancies.
Congenital infection with rubella virus can affect virtually
all organ systems. Common manifestations of congenital
rubella are listed below.
Deafness is the most common and often the sole manifesta-
tion of congenital rubella infection, especially after the 4th
month of gestation.
Eye defects, including cataracts, glaucoma, retinopathy, and
microphthalmia may occur.
Cardiac defects such as patent ductus arteriosus, ventricu-
lar septal defect, pulmonic stenosis, and coarctation of the
aorta are possible.


## p. xlviii (#117) #########################################

RUBELLA
Neurologic abnormalities, including microcephaly and
mental retardation, and other abnormalities, including bone
lesions, splenomegaly, hepatitis, and thrombocytopenia with
purpura may occur.
Manifestations of CRS may be delayed from 2 to 4 years.
Diabetes mellitus appearing in later childhood occurs fre-
quently in children with CRS. In addition, progressive
encephalopathy resembling subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) has been observed in some older
children with CRS.
CRS infants may have low HI titers, but may also have high
titers of neutralizing antibody which may persist for years or
be lost. Reinfection may occur. Impaired cell-mediated
immunity has been demonstrated in some children with
CRS.
Laboratory Diagnosis
There is no characteristic clinical picture for rubella. Clini-
cal diagnosis, except in the context of an outbreak, is notori-
ously unreliable and laboratory tests should be used for
conﬁrmation.
Virus isolation
Rubella virus can be isolated from throat swabs, urine, or
body ﬂuids. However, virus isolation is time-consuming and
is not done in many laboratories.
Serology
Rubella can be serologically conﬁrmed by documenting either
a signiﬁcant rise in rubella IgG, or a positive rubella IgM.
IgM antibody is present only in a primary infection and has a
half-life of about 7 days (it is usually undetectable after
4 weeks). Since decay is rapid, a negative test must be inter-
preted cautiously. False positive IgM tests may occur; this is
an important consideration when testing pregnant women
exposed to rubella.
Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test
HI is the “standard,” most commonly used technique. It is
sensitive and simple to perform, and allows for either
screening or diagnosis (if paired acute and convalescent sera
are tested). A >4-fold rise in HI antibody titer in paired sera
is diagnostic of recent infection. The test may be modiﬁed to

Complement fixation (CF) test
Since CF antibodies are detectable after HI antibodies have
already been made, a 24-fold rise in CF antibodies in acute
and convalescent sera may be demonstrated when HI titers
have already stabilized, indicating an acute, primary
infection. CF should not be used for screening.
Enzyme immunosorbent assays (EIA)
This test is generally more sensitive than the HI test and is
widely available and relatively easy for laboratories to
perform. It can also be modiﬁed to measure IgM antibodies.
Immunofluorescent antibody assays (IFA)
These are rapid and sensitive assays, similar in concept to
EIA tests. Commercial assays for both IgG and IgM are
available in the United States. Care must be taken with IgM
assay to avoid false-positive results due to complexes with
rheumatoid antibody.
Passive hemagglutination antibody (FA) test
This test (e.g., Rubacell) is not quite as sensitive as the HI
test and misses low titers (<1:16, which represents
approximately 5% to 10% of the normal adult population
with positive HI tests). It is, however, easily and rapidly
performed and is a useful screening test, but is not
recommended as a diagnostic test.
Latex agglutination (LA) test
The 15-minute latex particle agglutination test appears to be
sensitive and speciﬁc for screening.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Rubella occurs worldwide.
Mode of transmission
Rubella is spread from person to person via airborne
transmission or droplets shed from the respiratory secretions
of infected persons.
Rubella may be transmitted by subclinical cases (approxi-
mately 30%-50% of all rubella infections).


## p. xlviii (#119) #########################################

RUBELLA
Reservoir
Rubella is a human disease.
Temporal pattern
In temperate areas, incidence is usually highest in late
winter and early spring.
Communicability
Rubella is only moderately contagious. The disease is most
contagious when the rash is erupting, but virus may be shed
from 7 days before to 5-7 days or more after rash onset.
Infants with CBS shed large quantities of virus from body
secretions for up to one year and can therefore transmit
rubella to persons caring for them who are susceptible to the
disease.
Secular Trends in the United States
Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome became nationally
notiﬁable diseases in 1966. The largest annual total of cases
in the United States was in 1969, when 57,686 cases were
reported (58 cases per 100,000 population).
Following vaccine licensure in 1969, rubella incidence fell
rapidly. By 1983, fewer than 1,000 cases per year were
reported (<0.5 cases per 100,000 population). In 1992, only
160 cases of rubella were reported, the lowest annual total
ever reported in the United States. In 1993, a total of 192
cases was reported.
Unlike measles and varicella, rubella disease is reported
among several age groups. From 1982 through 1992, ap-
proximately 30% of cases occurred in each of three age
groups (<5, 5-19, and 20-39 years). Adults >40 years of age
typically account for <10% of reported cases.
In the prevaccine era, epidemics of rubella occurred every
6 to 9 years, with the last major US. epidemic occurring in
1964-1965. N 0 large epidemics have occurred since the
vaccine was licensed for use in 1969. Limited outbreaks,
however, continue to occur among groups of susceptible
persons in close contact with each other, e.g., in military
camps (virtually eliminated with the introduction of rigorous
vaccination programs), schools, colleges, hospitals, and other
places of employment. Prisons have been frequently affected
by rubella outbreaks in recent years.

CRS surveillance is maintained through the National Con-
genital Rubella Registry. The largest annual total of CRS to
the Registry was in 1970 (67 cases). Fewer than ﬁve cases
were reported annually throughout most of the 1980s.
Although reported rubella activity has consistently and
signiﬁcantly decreased since vaccine has been used in the
US, the incidence of CRS has only paralleled the dramatic
decrease in rubella cases since the mid-1970s. This is due to
an increased effort to vaccinate susceptible adolescents and
young adults, especially women. A moderate resurgence of
rubella occurred in 1990 and 1991 (1,125 and 1,401 cases,
respectively), with a high proportion of cases in persons 15
years of age and older. An increase in cases of CRS also
occurred during 1990-1991 (25 and 33, respectively).
Rubella Vaccine
Three rubella vaccines were licensed in the US. in 1969:
HPV-7 7 :DE-5 (duck embryo), HPV-772DK-12 (dog kidney),
and Sidehill (rabbit kidney) strains. The HPV-7 7 :DK-l2
was later removed from the market because there was a
higher rate of joint complaints following vaccination with
this strain. In January 1979, the RA 27/3 (human diploid
ﬁbroblast) strain (Meruvax-II) was licensed and other strains
discontinued.
The RA 27/3 rubella vaccine virus strain was isolated in 1965
at the Wistar Institute from a rubella-infected aborted fetus.
It is attenuated by 25-30 passages in tissue culture, using
human diploid ﬁbroblasts. It does not contain egg protein.
RA 27/3 vaccine is safe and more immunogenic than previ-
ously used rubella vaccines. Seroconversion occurs in about
95% of vaccinees. Immunity is believed to be lifelong. To
date, no signiﬁcant waning of immunity has been demon-
strated; follow-up of persons vaccinated in 1969 continues to
show high levels of presumably protective antibodies.
Vaccine virus is not communicable, except in the setting of
breast-feeding (see below), even though virus may be cul-
tured from the nasopharynx of vaccinees. Vaccinees may
experience subclinical reinfection with a boost in antibody
titers, but viremia is very rare.
Indications
Current recommendations are for vaccination with one dose
of rubella vaccine, all infants 12 months of age or older. The
vaccine should be administered as combined measles-
mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine.


## p. xlviii (#121) #########################################

RUBELLA
All older children not previously immunized should receive
one dose of rubella vaccine as MMR.
Efforts should be made to identify and vaccinate susceptible
adolescents and adults, particularly women of childbearing
age who are not pregnant. Particular emphasis should be
placed on vaccinating both males and females in colleges,
places of employment, and health care settings.
Evidence of immunity for rubella consists of either docu-
mented vaccination at or after 12 months of age or a positive
serologic test for rubella antibodies. Unlike a physician-
diagnosis of measles and mumps, a physician's report of
rubella disease is not acceptable as evidence of immunity. If
vaccination or serological status isnot known, vaccine should
be given without prior serological testing; immune persons
who are revaccinated are not at any increased risk of adverse
events from the revaccination.
Post-exposure prophylaxis
Neither rubella vaccine nor immune globulin is effective for
post-exposure prophylaxis of rubella. Vaccination after
exposure is not harmful and may possibly avert later dis-
ease.
Revaccination with rubella vaccine
Revaccination against rubella is not currently recommended.
Rather, the emphasis is on vaccinating those persons who
have never been vaccinated.
Adverse Events Following Vaccination
The most common complaints following rubella vaccine are
fever, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia. These are all more
common in adults, especially in women. Rash may occur in
10% of susceptible vaccinees.
About 25% (up to 55%) of adult women report joint pain after
vaccination; men and children report such symptoms much
less commonly. Transient frank arthritis with objective
clinical ﬁndings occurs less frequently in adult women (13%-
15%), and rarely in children (<1%). When joint symptoms do
occur, they generally begin 1-3 weeks after immunization,
persist for 1-3 days, and rarely recur. Joint symptoms are
believed to occur only in susceptible vaccinees.
Cases of persistent or recurrent joint symptoms have been
reported, but such cases appear to be rare. One group of
investigators reported 5% of adult female vaccinees with
persistent or recurrent arthropathy following vaccination.

Rubella virus has been isolated from joint effusions of
vaccinees with acute and with chronic arthritis and cultured
from the lymphocytes of some adults with persistent arthri-
tis, but it was not determined whether this was of natural
origin or was vaccine-associated.
The Institute of Medicine recently reviewed all available
data on rubella and joint adverse events, and concluded that
“The evidence indicates a causal relation between the cur-
rently used rubella vaccine strain (RA27/3) and acute
arthritis.” With respect to chronic arthritis, they concluded
that, “The evidence is consistent with a causal relation
between the currently used rubella vaccine strain (RA27/3)
and chronic arthritis in adult women, although the evidence
is limited in scope and conﬁned to reports from one institu-
tion.”
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
continues to recommend the vaccination of all adult women
not known to be immune to rubella.
Contraindications to Vaccination
Persons with a history of anaphylaxis to neomycin should
generally not receive rubella vaccine.
Persons with moderate to severe illness should not be vacci-
nated until the illness has resolved. Minor illness (e.g., otitis
media, mild upper respiratory infections), concurrent antibi-
otic therapy, and exposure or recovery from other illness are
not contraindications to rubella vaccination.
Persons with impaired immune systems, resulting from
leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, immune
deﬁciency disease, or immunosuppressive therapy should not
be vaccinated. However, treatment with low dose (<2 mg-kg/
day), alternate day, topical, or aerosolized steroid prepara-
tions is not a contraindication to rubella vaccination. Per-
sons whose immunosuppressive therapy with steroids or
chemotherapeutic agents has been stopped for 3 months may
be vaccinated. Rubella vaccine should be considered for
persons with HIV infection.
Pregnant women should not receive rubella vaccine for
theoretic reasons. There is no evidence that rubella vaccine
virus causes fetal damage (see next page). Pregnancy should
be avoided for 3 months after vaccination.
Receipt of antibody-containing blood products (e. g. , im-
mune globulin, whole blood or packed red blood cells, intra-
venous immune globulin) may interfere with Seroconversion
to rubella vaccine. Vaccine should be given 2 weeks before,


## p. xlviii (#123) #########################################

RUBELLA
or deferred for at least 3 months following administration of
an antibody-containing blood product. If rubella vaccine is
given as combined MMR, a longer delay may be necessary
before vaccination. For more information, see the ACIP's
1994 General Recommendations on Immunization (included
in Appendix A).
Previous administration of human anti-Rho(D) immune
globulin (RhoGam) does not generally interfere with an
immune response to rubella vaccine and is not a
contraindication to postpartum vaccination. However,
women who have received anti-Rho immune globulin should
be serologically tested 6-8 weeks after vaccination to assure
that seroconversion has occurred. Obtaining laboratory
evidence of seroconversion in other vaccinees is not neces-
sary.
Persons with a history of anaphylaxis following exposure to
eggs may be vaccinated with rubella vaccine, since it is
grown in human cells and does not contain egg protein.
Although vaccine virus may be isolated from the pharynx,
vaccinees do not transmit rubella to others, except in the
case of the vaccinated breast-feeding mother. In this situa-
tion, the infant may be infected through breast milk and may
develop a mild rash illness, but serious effects have not been
reported. Infants infected through breast-feeding have been
shown to respond normally to rubella vaccination at
15 months of age. Breast-feeding is not a contraindication to
rubella vaccination.
Rubella Vaccination of Women of
Childbearing Age
Postpubertal woman who state that they are pregnant or
plan to become pregnant within the next 3 months should
not be vaccinated. Vaccinated women should be counseled
about the need to avoid pregnancy for 3 months following
vaccination.
Rubella Vaccine in Pregnancy
While pregnancy is a contraindication to rubella vaccination,
some women have been inadvertently vaccinated while
pregnant or soon before conception. When rubella vaccine
was licensed, this situation was of concern because of the
known teratogenicity of the wild virus strain. Therefore,
from 1979-1989, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) maintained a registry of women vaccinated
during pregnancy to determine whether CRS would occur in
infants of such mothers.

Subclinical fetal infection has been detected serologically in
approximately 1%-2% of infants born to susceptible
vaccinees, regardless of the vaccine strain.
However, based on data collected by the CDC since 197 9 in
the Vaccine in Pregnancy (VIP) Registry, no evidence of
CRS has occurred in offspring of the 321 susceptible women
who received RA 27/3 and who continued pregnancy to term.
The observed risk of vaccine-induced malformation is now
0%, with a maximum theoretical risk of 1.6%, based on 95%
conﬁdence limits (1.2% for all types of rubella vaccine).
Since the risk of the vaccine to the fetus appears to be ex-
tremely low, if it exists at all, routine termination of preg-
nancy is not recommended. Individual counseling for these
women is recommended. As of April 30, 1989, CDC discon-
tinued accepting new enrollees into the VIP registry.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of prevaccine pregnancy
prevention counseling in women of childbearing age in
Hawaii revealed that the pregnancy rate for all women
15-44 years old in Hawaii was 122.8/1,000/year and the
pregnancy rate among vaccinees 15-44 years of age who were
counseled was 14.0/1,000/year. Thus, efﬁcacy of counseling
is 88.6% ([122.8-14.0]/[122.8 x 100]).
The ACIP continues to state that pregnant women should
not be vaccinated, despite the small theoretical risk to the
fetus of a vaccinated woman.
Strategies to Decrease Rubella and CR8
CRS elimination
Although the CRS case count is low, rubella transmission
continues to occur, and increased in 1989 and 1990. The
elimination of CRS will require several interventions:
—Achievement and maintenance of high immunization levels.
—Intensive surveillance of rubella and CRS.
—Prompt outbreak control when rubella occurs.
Vaccination of susceptible postpubertal females
Perhaps the ﬁnal frontier in conquering rubella and CRS can
be reached by expanding and intensifying efforts to vaccinate
susceptible adolescents and young adults of childbearing age.


## p. xlviii (#125) #########################################

RUBELLA
These efforts should include:
—Vaccinating in family planning clinics, sexually transmitted
disease (STD) clinics, and as part of routine gynecologic care.
—Maximizing use of premarital serology results.
—Emphasizing immunization for college students.
—Vaccinating women postpartum and postabortion.
—Immunizing prison staff, and when possible, prison in-
mates, especially women inmates.
Hospital rubella programs
Emphasis should be placed on vaccinating susceptible hospi-
tal personnel, both male and female (volunteers, trainees,
nurses, physicians, etc.) Ideally, all hospital employees
should be immune. It is important to note that screening
programs alone are not adequate. Vaccination of susceptible
staff must follow.
Use of combination vaccines
The hope is that use of combination vaccines such as MR and
MMR vaccines and the two-dose schedule of MMR vaccine for
measles control will increase the level of seropositivity in
children and adults. Persons already immune to rubella
should not have adverse events attributable to rubella vac-
cine; those not already immune are in need of vaccination
against rubella.

Hepatitis B
clinically similar yet etiologically and epidemiologi-
cally distinct diseases. Hepatitis A (formerly called
infectious hepatitis) and hepatitis B (formerly called serum
hepatitis) have been recognized as separate entities since the
early 1940s and can be diagnosed with speciﬁc serologic
tests. Hepatitis A is transmitted primarily person-to-person
through fecal contamination and oral ingestion, and is facili-
tated by poor personal hygiene, poor sanitation, and intimate
contact. Non-A, non-B hepatitis, includes two epidemiologi-
cally distinct types of hepatitis: (1) bloodborne, primarily due
to the hepatitis C virus (HCV), and (2) enterically transmit-
ted, due to the hepatitis E virus and spread by the fecal-oral
route. Hepatitis E has not been found to originate in the
United States, but has been reported in parts of Asia, Africa,
and Mexico. Another distinct type of hepatitis, delta hepati-
tis, is an infection dependent on the hepatitis B virus (HBV).
It may occur as a coinfection with acute HBV infection or as
superinfection of a HBV carrier.
v iral hepatitis is a term commonly used for several
Epidemic jaundice was described by Hippocrates in the 5th
century BC. The ﬁrst recorded cases of serum hepatitis,
hepatitis B, are thought to be those that followed the admin-
istration of smallpox vaccine containing human lymph to
shipyard workers in Germany in 1883. In the early and
middle parts of this century, serum hepatitis was repeatedly
observed following the use of contaminated needles and
syringes. The role of blood as a vehicle for virus transmis-
sion was further emphasized in 1943, when Beeson described
jaundice among seven recipients of blood transfusions.
Australia antigen, later called hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg), was ﬁrst described in 1965, and the Dane Particle
(complete hepatitis B virion) was identiﬁed in 1970. Identiﬁ-
cation of seroiogic markers for HBV infection followed, which
helped clarify the natural history of the disease. Ultimately,
HBsAg was prepared in quantity and now comprises the
immunogen in highly effective vaccines for the prevention of
HBV infection.

Hepatitis B
HBV infection is an established cause of acute and chronic
hepatitis, cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
HBV is the most common cause of chronic viremia known,
with an estimated 200 to 300 million chronic carriers world-
wide. It is second only to tobacco among known human
carcinogens, and is the cause of up to 80% of hepatocellular
carcinomas. More than 250,000 persons die worldwide each
year of hepatitis B-associated acute and chronic liver disease.
HBV is a small, double-shelled virus in the class
Hepadnaviridae. The virus contains numerous antigenic
components, including HBsAg, hepatitis B core antigen
(HBcAg), and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). The virus
contains partially double-stranded DNA, and a DNA-depen-
dent DNA polymerase enzyme. HBV is relatively resilient
and, in some instances, has been shown to remain infectious
on environmental surfaces for at least a month at room
temperature.
Schematic of Hepatitis B Virus
no», Protein



HBA! Can be detected in serum after detergent
(SOS) treatment of the virus core.
Several well-deﬁned antigen-antibody systems are associated
with HBV infection. HBsAG, formerly called Australia
antigen or hepatitis-associated antigen, is an antigenic
determinant found on the surface of the virus. It also makes
up subviral 22-nm spherical and tubular particles. HBsAg
can be identiﬁed in serum 30 to 60 days after exposure to
HBV and persists for variable periods. During replication,
HBV produces HBsAg in great excess.


## p. xlviii (#129) #########################################

HEPATITIS B
HBeAg is the nucleocapsid protein core of HBV and is dis-
tinct from HBsAg and hepatitis B (HBeAg). HBcAg is not
detectable in serum by conventional techniques, but can be
detected in liver tissue in persons with acute or chronic HBV
infection. HBeAg, a soluble protein, is also contained in the
core of HBV. HBeAg is detected in the serum of persons with
high virus titers and indicates high infectivity. Antibody to
HBsAg (Anti-HBs) develops during convalescence after acute
HBV infection or following hepatitis B vaccination. Antibody
to HBeAg (Anti-HBc) indicates infection with HBV at an
undeﬁned time in the past. IgM class antibody to HBeAg
(IgM anti-HBc) indicates recent infection with HBV. Anti-
body to HBeAg (Anti-HBe) becomes detectable when HBeAg
is lost and is associated with low infectivity of serum.
Clinical Features of Acute HBV infection
The clinical course of acute hepatitis B is indistinguishable
from that of other types of acute viral hepatitis. The incuba-
tion period ranges from 45 to 160 days (average, 120 days).
Clinical signs and symptoms occur more often in adults than
in infants or children, who usually have an asymptomatic
acute course. However, approximately 50% of adults who
haveacute infections are asymptomatic. When symptoms
occur in acute HBV infection, they may occur in the following
patterns.
The preicteric, or prodromal, phase from initial symptoms to
onset of jaundice, usually lasts from 3 to 10 days. It is char-
acterized by insidious onset with malaise; anorexia; nausea
and vomiting; abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant;
fever; headache; myalgias; skin rashes; arthralgias and
arthritis; and dark urine, beginning 1 to 2 days before the
onset of jaundice. The icteric phase is variable, but usually
lasts from I to 3 weeks, characterized by jaundice, light or
gray stools, hepatic tenderness and hepatomegaly
(splenomegaly is less common). During convalescence,
malaise and fatigue may persist for weeks or months, while
jaundice, anorexia, and other symptoms disappear.
Most acute HBV infections in adults result in complete
recovery with elimination of HBsAg from the blood and the
production of anti-HBs creating immunity from future
infection.
Complications
While most acute HBV infections in adults result in complete
recovery, fulminant hepatitis occurs in about 1% to 2% of
persons, with mortality rates of 63% to 93%. About 350 to
450 persons die of fulminant disease each year. Although
the consequences of acute HBV infection can be severe, most
of the serious complications associated with HBV infection

Chronic HBV infection
Approximately 10% of all acute HBV infections progress to
chronic infection, with the risk of chronic HBV infection
decreasing with age. As many as 90% of infants who acquire
HBV infection from their mothers at birth become carriers.
Of children who become infected with HBV between 1 year
and 5 years of age, 30% to 50% become carriers. By adult-
hood, the risk of becoming a carrier is 6% to 10%.
Persons with chronic infection are often asymptomatic and
may not be aware that they are infected, yet are capable of
infecting others. They are at high risk for chronic hepatitis,
cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Chronic active hepatitis develops in over 25% of carriers, and
often results in cirrhosis. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 per-
sons die of hepatitis B-related cirrhosis each year in the
United States. Persons with chronic HBV infection are at 12
to 300 times higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma than
noncarriers. An estimated 1,000 to 1,500 die each year in
the United States of hepatitis B-related liver cancer.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic
ﬁndings. HBV infection cannot be differentiated on the basis
of clinical symptoms alone, and deﬁnitive diagnosis depends
on the results of serologic testing. Serologic markers of HBV
infection vary depending on whether the infection is acute or
chronic.
HBsAg is the most commonly used test for diagnosing acute
HBV infections or detecting carriers. HBsAg can be detected as
early as 1 or 2 weeks and as late as 11 or 12 weeks after
exposure to HBV when sensitive assays are used. The
presence of HBsAg indicates that a person is infectious,
regardless of whether the infection is acute or chronic.
Anti-HBc (core antibody) develops in all HBV infections,
appears shortly after HBsAg in acute disease, and indicates
HBV infection at some undeﬁned time in the past. Anti-HBc
only occurs after HBV infection, and does not develop in
persons whose immunity to HBV is from vaccine. Anti-HBc
generally persists for life and therefore is not a serologic
marker for acute infection.


## p. xlviii (#131) #########################################

IgM anti-HBc appears in persons with acute disease about
the time of illness onset and indicates recent infection with
HBV. IgM anti-HBc is generally detectable
4 to 6 months after onset of illness and is the best serologic
marker of acute HBV infection. A negative test for IgM-anti-
HBc together with a positive test for HBsAg in a single blood
sample identiﬁes a chronic HBV infection.
HBeAg is a useful marker associated strongly with the
number of infective HBV particles in the serum and a higher
risk of infectivity.
Anti-HBs (surface antibody) is a protective, neutralizing
antibody. The presence of anti-HBs following acute HBV
infection generally indicates recovery and immunity from
reinfection. Anti-HBs can also be acquired as an immune
response to hepatitis B vaccine or passively transferred by
administration of HBIG. Using radioimmunoassay (RIA), a
minimum of 10 sample ratio units should be used to desig-
nate immunity. Using enzyme immunoassay (EIA), the
manufacturer’s recommended positive should be considered
an appropriate measure of immunity. The level of anti-HBs
may also be expressed in milli-International Units/mL (mIU/
mL). Ten mIU-mL is considered to indicate a protective level
of immunity.
Treatment and Management of HBV Infection
There is no speciﬁc therapy for acute HBV infection. Alpha
interferon is the most effective treatment for chronic HBV
infection and is successful 25% to 50% of the time.
Persons with acute HBV infections and carriers should
prevent their blood and other potentially infective body ﬂuids
from contacting other persons and should not donate blood.
They should not share eating utensils, toothbrushes, or
razors with household members.
In the hospital setting, patients with HBV infection should
be managed with Blood-Body Fluid Precautions (See CDC
Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals). Health
care workers should employ universal precautions for all
patients, regardless of their bloodborne infection status.

Transmission
The virus is transmitted by parenteral or mucosal exposure
to HBsAg-positive body ﬂuids from persons who are carriers
or have acute HBV infection. The highest concentrations of
virus are in blood and serous ﬂuids; lower titers are found in
other fluids, such as saliva and semen. Saliva can be a
vehicle of transmission through bites; however, other types of
exposure to saliva, including kissing, are unlikely modes of
transmission. There appears to be no transmission of HBV
via tears, sweat, urine, stool, or droplet nuclei.
Direct percutaneous inoculation of HBV by needles during
injection drug use is an important mode of transmission.
Transmission of HBV may also occur by other percutaneous
exposure, including tattooing, ear piercing, and acupuncture,
as well as needle-sticks or other injuries from sharp instru-
ments sustained by medical personnel; however, these expo-
sures account for only a small proportion of reported cases in
the United States. Breaks in the skin without overt needle
puncture, such as fresh cutaneous scratches, abrasions,
burns, or other lesions, may also serve as routes for entry.
In the United States, the most important route of transmis-
sion is by sexual contact, either heterosexual or homo-
sexual, with an infected person. Fecal-oral transmission
does not appear to occur. However, transmission among
homosexual men occurs possibly via contamination from
asymptomatic rectal mucosal lesions at sites of sexual con-
tact.
Contamination of mucosal surfaces with infective serum or
plasma may occur in mouth pipetting accidents, accidental
eye splash, or other direct contact with mucous membranes
of the eyes or mouth, such as hand-to-mouth or hand-to-eye
when contaminated with infective blood or serum. Transfer
of infective material to skin lesions or mucous membranes
via inanimate environmental surfaces may occur by touching
surfaces of various types of hospital equipment. Contamina-
tion of mucosal surfaces with infective secretions other than
serum or plasma could occur with contact involving semen.
Perinatal transmission from mother to infant at birth is very
efficient. If the mother is positive for both HBsAg and
HBeAg, 70%-90% of infants will become infected, and up to
90% of these infected infants will become HBV carriers. An
estimated 25% of these carriers will ultimately die of liver
failure secondary to chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or
primary hepatocellular carcinoma. The risk of perinatal
transmission from a woman who is positive for HBsAg only
is estimated to be 20%, with 90% of infected infants becom-
ing carriers.


## p. xlviii (#133) #########################################

HEP-477775 B
Communicability
Persons with either acute or chronic HBV infection should be
considered infectious any time that HBsAg is present in the
blood. When symptoms are present in persons with acute
HBV infection, HBsAg can be found in the blood and body
ﬂuids of infected persons for l to 2 months before and after
the onset of symptoms.
Patterns of transmission
The frequency of infection and patterns of transmission vary
in different parts of the world. Approximately 45% of the
global population lives in areas with a high prevalence of
chronic HBV infection (8% of the population is HBsAg-
positive); 43% in areas with a moderate prevalence (2% to 7%
of the population is HBsAg-positive); and 12% in areas with
a low prevalence (<2% of the population is HBsAg-positive).
In China, Southeast Asia, most of Africa, most Pacific Is-
lands, parts of the Middle East, and the Amazon Basin, 8%
to 15% of the population carry the virus. The lifetime risk of
HBV infection is >60%, and most infections are acquired at
birth or during early childhood, when the risk of developing
chronic infections is greatest. In these areas, because most
infections are asymptomatic, very little acute disease related
to HBV occurs, but rates of chronic liver disease and liver
cancer in adults are very high.
In the United States, Western Europe, and Australia, HBV
infection is a disease of low endemicity. Infection occurs
primarily during adulthood, and only 0.1% to 0.5% of the
population are chronic carriers.
Secular Trends in the United States
Hepatitis has been reportable in the United States for many
years. Hepatitis B became reportable as a distinct entity
during the 1970s, after serologic tests to differentiate differ-
ent types of hepatitis became Widely available.
Approximately 20,000 cases of hepatitis B are reported
annually in the United States. However, HBV infection is
greatly underreported, due primarily to the high proportion
of infections that are asymptomatic or anicteric.

More accurate estimates of the magnitude of HBV infection
are derived from areas of intensive clinical and serologic
surveillance for hepatitis. Data from these areas suggest
that an estimated 200,000-300,000 persons in the United
States become infected with HBV each year. An estimated 1-
1.25 million persons are chronically infected with HBV, and
20,000-30,000 new carriers develop each year.
The estimated incidence of HBV infection rose in the late
1970s through the mid-1980s, from approximately 40 cases
per 100,000 population in 1978 to the peak of 70 cases per
100,000 in 1985. Since that time, incidence has gradually
decreased, to approximately 40 cases per 100,000 in 1992.
Over 80% of acute HBV infections occur among adults.
Adolescents account for approximately 8% of infections, and
children and perinatal transmission account for approxi-
mately 4% each. Perinatal transmission accounts for a
disproportionate 24% of chronic infections.
The most common risk factor for HBV infection in the United
States is sexual contact, either heterosexual (41%), or homo-
sexual (14%). Injection drug use accounts for 12% of cases,
4% of cases occur by household contact with a chronic carrier,
and health care workers account for 2% of cases. Approxi-
mately 25% of all persons with HBV infection have no known
risk factor for infection.
Although HBV infection is uncommon among adults in the
general population (the lifetime risk of infection is <20%), it
is highly prevalent in certain groups. Risk for infection
varies with occupation, lifestyle, or environment (see next
table). Generally, the highest risk for HBV infection is
associated with lifestyles, occupations, or environments in
which contact with blood from infected persons is frequent.
In addition, the prevalence of HBV markers for acute or
chronic infection increases with increasing number of years
of high risk behavior. For instance, an estimated 40% of
injection drug users become infected with HBV after 1 year
of drug use, while over 80% are infected after 10 years.

Hepatitis B Prevention Strategies in the
United States
Hepatitis B vaccines have been available in the United
States since 1981. However, the impact of vaccine on HBV
disease has been less than optimal, and the incidence of
reported hepatitis B cases is as high now as it was before the
vaccine was available.
The apparent lack of impact from the vaccine can be attrib-
uted to several factors. First, a large proportion of persons
with HBV infection (25% to 30%) deny any risk factors for
the disease. These persons would not be identiﬁed by a
targeted risk factor screening approach.
Second, the three major risk groups (heterosexuals with
contact with infected persons or multiple partners, injection
drug users, and homosexually active males), are not reached
effectively by targeted programs. Deterrents to immuniza-
tion of these groups include lack of awareness of the risk of
disease and its consequences, lack of public sector programs,
and vaccine cost. Difficulty in gaining access to these popu-
lations is also a problem. Further, there has been limited



- No identified risk factor in 25%-30% of adults with acute
hepatitis B
a Limited access to persons in some high risk groups
- difficult to identify as belonging to a risk group
- less likely to receive preventive care
- Limited success in providing vaccine to persons in
some high risk groups
- rapidly infected after beginning high risk behaviors
- low initial vaccine acceptance
- low completion rates

success in providing vaccine to persons in high-risk groups
due to rapid acquisition of infection after beginning high-risk
behaviors, low initial vaccine acceptance, and low completion
rates.
A comprehensive hepatitis B prevention strategy is now
being implemented which includes (a) prenatal testing of
pregnant women for HBsAg to identify newborns who re-
quire immunoprophylaxis for the prevention of perinatal
infection and to identify household contacts who should be
vaccinated, (b) routine vaccination of infants, (0) vaccination
of certain adolescents, and (d) vaccination of adults at high
risk of infection.
Hepatitis B Vaccine
A plasma-derived vaccine was licensed in the United States
in 1981. It was produced from 22nm HBsAg particles puri-
ﬁed from the plasma of human carriers. The vaccine was
safe and effective, but was not well accepted, possibly be-
cause of unbased fears of transmission of live HBV and other
blood-borne pathogens (e.g., human immunodeﬁciency virus).
This vaccine was removed from the U.S. market in 1992.
Recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the United
States in July 1986, and was the ﬁrst vaccine licensed in the
United States produced by recombinant DNA technology. A
second, similar vaccine was licensed in August 1989.
Recombinant vaccine is produced by inserting a plasmid
containing the gene for HBsAg into common baker’s yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Yeast cells then produce HBsAg,
which is harvested and puriﬁed. The recombinant vaccine
contains over 95% HBsAg protein (5 to 40 mcg-ml); yeast-
derived proteins may constitute up to 5% of the ﬁnal product,
but no yeast DNA is detectable in the vaccine. HBV infection
cannot result from use of the recombinant vaccine, since no
potentially infectious viral DNA or complete viral particles
are produced in the recombinant system. Vaccine HBsAg is
adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide, and thimerosal is added as
a preservative.
After three intramuscular doses of hepatitis B vaccine, over
90% of healthy adults and over 95% of infants, children, and
adolescents (from birth to 19 years of age) develop adequate
antibody responses. The vaccine is 80% to 100% effective in
preventing infection or clinical hepatitis in those who receive
the complete course of vaccine. Larger vaccine doses (2 to 4
times the normal adult dose) or an increased number of
doses are required to induce protective antibody in a high
proportion of hemodialysis patients and may also be neces-
sary in other immunocompromised persons. Protective
antibody appears to persist for 13 years or more.


## p. xlviii (#137) #########################################

HEPATIT IS B
The recommended dosage of vaccine utilized may differ
depending on the age of the recipient, certain exposure
circumstances (e.g., hemodialysis, perinatal), and type of
vaccine (see next table). Hemodialysis patients should
receive a 40 mcg-ml dose in a series of three or four doses.
One of the vaccines (RECOMBIVAX HB) has a special dialy-
sis patient formulation that contains 40 mcg.

The deltoid muscle is the recommended site for hepatitis B
vaccination in adults and children, while the antero-lateral
thigh is recommended for infants and neonates. immunoge-
nicity of vaccine in adults is lower when injections are given
in the buttock.
Routine Vaccination
Infants
Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants, and
should be incorporated into the infant’s routine vaccination
schedule. Primary vaccination consists of three intramuscu-
lar doses of vaccine with the second and third doses given 1
to 3 and 2 to 17 months, respectively, after the ﬁrst (see next
table). The ﬁrst dose can be administered during the new-
born period, preferably before the infant is discharged from
the hospital, but no later than when the infant is 2 months of
age. Because the highest titers of anti-HBs are achieved
when the last two doses of vaccine are spaced at least
4 months apart, schedules that achieve this spacing may be

fHepatitis B vaccine can be administered simultaneously with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae type b conjugate, measles-mumps-rubella, and oral polio vaccines at the same visit.
Preterm infants
Premature infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should
receive immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine and
hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) beginning at or shortly
after birth (see details below). For premature infants of
HBsAg-negative mothers, the optimal timing of hepatitis B
vaccination has not been determined. Some studies suggest
that decreased seroconversion rates might occur in some
premature infants with low birthweights (i.e., <2000 grams)
following administration of hepatitis B vaccine at birth.
Such low birthweight premature infants of HBsAg-negative
mothers should receive the hepatitis B vaccine series, which
can be initiated at discharge from the nursery if the infant
weighs at least 2000 grams, or at 2 months of age along with
DTP, OPV, and Hib vaccine. When hepatitis B vaccine is
used, the full recommended dose should be used. Divided or
reduced doses are not recommended.
Children and adults
Routine preexposure vaccination should be considered for
groups of children and adults who are at increased risk of
HBV infection. In adults, the ﬁrst and second doses should
be separated by 1 month, and the second and third doses by
a minimum of 2 months (typically 5 to 12 months).


## p. xlviii (#139) #########################################

HEPATITIS B
Health care workers
The risk of health care workers contracting HBV infection
depends on how often they are exposed to blood or blood
products through percutaneous and permucosal exposures.
Any health care or public safety worker may be at risk for
HBV exposure, depending on the tasks performed. If those
tasks involve contact with blood or blood-contaminated body
ﬂuids, then such workers should be vaccinated. Risk is often
highest during training periods. Therefore, it is recom-
mended that vaccination be completed during training in
schools of medicine, dentistry, nursing, laboratory technol-
ogy, and other allied health professions.
Clients and staff of institutions for the
developmentally disabled
The special behavioral and medical problems of the retarded
make this a high-risk setting. The risk in these institutions
is related to contact with blood and also with bites and
contact with skin lesions and other body ﬂuids that contain
HBV. Clients and staff of group and foster homes where a
carrier is known to be present should also be vaccinated.
Hemodialysis patients
Although the hepatitis B vaccine is less effective in these
patients, it is recommended for all susceptible hemodialysis
patients.
Homosexually active men
It is important to vaccinate these individuals as soon as
possible after homosexual activity begins.
Injection drug users
Sharing needles is an extremely high-risk activity for trans-
mitting HBV. All injection drug users who are susceptible to
HBV should be vaccinated as soon as possible after their
drug use begins.
Recipients of certain blood products
Persons who receive special products to help their blood clot,
such as those with hemophilia, are at high risk of infection.
Vaccination should be initiated at the time their speciﬁc
clotting disorder is identiﬁed.


## p. xlviii (#140) #########################################

HEPATITIS B
Household and sexual contacts of HBV carriers
Household members and sex partners of HBV carriers should
be tested and, if susceptible, should be vaccinated.
Adoptees from countries of high HBV endemicity
Orphans or unaccompanied minors from countries of high or
intermediate HBV endemicity should be screened for HBsAg,
and, if positive, their household members should be vacci-
nated.
Other contacts of HBV carriers
Persons who have casual contact with carriers at schools and
offices are at little risk of catching HBV infection, and vac-
cine is not recommended for them. Unless special circum-
stances exist, such as behavior problems (biting or scratch-
ing) or medical conditions (severe skin disease) which might
facilitate transmission, vaccination of contacts of carriers in
child care centers is not indicated.
Special populations from areas with high rates of
hepatitis B
In certain U.S. populations, such as Alaskan Natives, Pacific
Islanders, and refugees from HBV endemic areas, HBV
infection is highly endemic and transmission occurs prima-
rily during childhood. In such groups, vaccination of all
infants is particularly important.
Immigrants and refugees from areas with highly endemic
HBV disease should be screened for HBV upon resettlement
in the US. If a carrier is identified, all susceptible house-
hold members should be vaccinated. Even if no carriers are
found, vaccination is recommended for susceptible children
less than 7 years of age because of the high rate of
interfamilial spread of HBV.
Long-term inmates of prisons
The risks of prisoners contracting HBV infection while in
prison may be due to use of illegal injection drug use or
homosexual activity. The prison setting provides an access
point for vaccination of inmates with histories of high-risk
behavior.


## p. xlviii (#141) #########################################

Heterosexually active persons
Those with multiple sexual partners are at increased risk of
HBV infection. Vaccination is recommended for those who
are diagnosed as having recently acquired sexually transmit-
ted diseases, for prostitutes, and for persons who have a
history of sexual activity with multiple partners in the
previous 6 months.
Travelers
Persons who plan to travel to areas outside the United States
that have high rates of HBV infection should be vaccinated if
they stay in these areas for more than 6 months, and have
close contact with the local population. Persons traveling for
shorter durations who may have sexual contact with local
persons in areas where HBV infection is common should also
be vaccinated. Persons traveling abroad who will perform
medical procedures in areas where HBV infection is common
are at very high risk.
Long Term Efficacy of Hepatitis B Vaccine
Available data show that vaccine-induced antibody levels
decline with time. Nevertheless, immune memory remains
intact for >11 years following immunization, and both adults
and children with declining antibody levels are still protected
against signiﬁcant HBV infection (i.e., clinical disease,
HBsAg antigenemia, or signiﬁcant elevation of liver en-
zymes). Further, exposure to HBV results in an anamnestic
anti-HBs response that prevents clinically signiﬁcant HBV
infection. Chronic HBV infection has only rarely been docu-
mented among vaccine responders.
For adults and children with normal immune status, booster
doses of vaccine are not recommended, nor is routine sero-
logic testing to assess immune status of vaccinees indicated.
The need for booster doses after longer intervals will con-
tinue to be assessed as additional information becomes
available.
For hemodialysis patients, the need for booster doses should
be assessed by annual testing of vaccinees for antibody
levels, and booster doses should be provided when antibody
levels decline below 10 mIU/ml.

Management of Vaccine Nonresponders
A number of factors have been associated with nonresponse
to hepatitis B vaccine. These include vaccine factors (e.g.,
dose, schedule, injection site), and host factors. Older age
(>40 years), male gender, obesity, smoking, and chronic
illness have been independently associated with nonresponse
to hepatitis B vaccine.
Further vaccination of nonresponders to a primary vaccina-
tion series administered in the deltoid muscle produces
adequate response in 15% to 25% after one additional dose
and in 30% to 50% after three additional doses. For persons
who did not respond to a primary vaccination series given in
the buttock, data suggest that revaccination in the arm
induces adequate antibody in >7 5%. Revaccination with one
or more additional doses should be considered for persons
who fail to respond to vaccination in the deltoid, and is
recommended for those who have failed to respond to vacci-
nation in the buttock.
Prevaccination serologic testing
The decision to screen potential vaccine recipients for prior
infection depends on the cost of vaccination, the cost of
testing for susceptibility, and the expected prevalence of
immune persons in the group. Screening is usually cost-
effective, and should be considered, in groups with a high
risk of HBV infection (HBV markers prevalence >20%) such
as male homosexuals, injection drug users, Alaskan natives,
Paciﬁc Islanders, children of immigrants from endemic
countries, and family members of HBsAg carriers. Screening
is usually not cost-effective for groups with a low expected
prevalence of HBV serologic markers such as health profes-
sionals in their training years.
Serologic testing is not recommended before routine vaccina-
tion of infants and children.
Post-vaccination serologic testing
Testing for immunity following vaccination is not recom-
mended routinely, but should be considered for persons
whose subsequent management depends on knowing their
immune status, such as dialysis patients and staff, and
persons in whom a suboptimal response may be anticipated,
such as those who have received vaccine in the buttock.
Post-vaccination testing should also be considered for those
at occupational risk who may have needlestick exposures
necessitating postexposure prophylaxis. When necessary,
post-vaccination testing should be done between 1 to 2
months after completion of the vaccine series to provide
deﬁnitive information on response to the vaccine.


## p. xlviii (#143) #########################################

HEPATITIS B m
Post-Exposure Management
Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended as part of the therapy
used to prevent hepatitis B infection following exposure to
HBV. The hepatitis B vaccine series should be started at the
same time as other therapy, primarily treatment with
hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG).
Post exposure use of hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for
the following persons:
Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers
The following regimen should prevent 85% to 90% of chronic
infections in infants born to HBsAg- and HBeAg-positive
mothers.
HBIG (0.5 ml) should be given IM, preferably within
12 hours of birth. Hepatitis B vaccine should be given IM in
three doses. The ﬁrst dose should be given at the same time
as HBIG, but at a different site. If vaccine is not
immediately available, the ﬁrst injection should be given
within 7 days of birth. The second and third doses should be
given 1 month and 6 months, respectively, after the ﬁrst.
Testing for HBsAg and anti-HBs is recommended at 9 to
15 months of age (or 3 to 9 months after the third dose) to
monitor the success of therapy.
HBIG given at birth does not interfere with the
administration of oral polio vaccine and diphtheria-tetanus-
pertussis vaccines administered at 2 months of age.
Subsequent doses of hepatitis B vaccine do not interfere with
the routine pediatric vaccine schedule.
Persons having accidents involving HBsAg-positive
blood where there is entry through the skin or a mucous
membrane shoWuld be tested for HBsAg and HIV antibody.
In response to the Health Omnibus Programs Extension Act
of 1988, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
has issued guidelines which state that after identiﬁcation
and consent is obtained from the individual from whom
exposure occurred, a blood sample should be drawn and
tested for HBsAg and HIV antibody. Management of these
individuals should take into account (1) HBV vaccination
and vaccine response status of the exposed person,
(2) whether the source of blood is available, and (3) the
HBsAg status of the source (see next table).

Susceptible sexual partners of persons with acute
HB V infection, or hepatitis B carriers
A single dose of HBIG (0.06ml/kg), given within 14 days of
the last sexual contact, is recommended. They should also
begin the hepatitis B vaccine series, if prophylaxis can be
started within 14 days of the last sexual contact or if ongoing
sexual contact will occur. Alternatively, for persons who are
not members of a high-risk group, one dose of HBIG can be
given and the partner retested for HBsAg 3 months later. If
still positive, then a second dose of HBIG should be given
and the vaccine series initiated.
Household contacts of persons with acute HBV
infection
Since infants have close contact with primary caregivers and
they have a higher risk of becoming carriers, prophylaxis
with HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine for infants less than
12 months old is indicated if the mother or primary caregiver
has acute HBV infection. Prophylaxis for other household
contacts is not indicated unless they have identiﬁable blood
exposure such as sharing toothbrushes or razors. These
exposures should be treated similarly to sexual exposures. If

the index patient becomes a carrier, all household members
should be immunized.
Adverse Events Following Vaccination
The most common adverse event following hepatitis B
vaccine is pain at the site of injection, reported in 13% to 29%
of adults and 3% to 9% of children. Mild systemic
complaints, such as fatigue, headache, and irritability have
been reported in 11% to 17% of adults and 0% to 20% of
children. Low-grade fever (>37.7 degrees C) has been
reported in 1% of adults and 0.4% to 6.4% of children.
Serious systemic adverse events and allergic reactions are
rarely reported following hepatitis B vaccine.
Contraindications and Precautions
Serious allergic reaction to a prior dose of hepatitis B vaccine
or a vaccine component is a contraindication to further doses
of vaccine. Such allergic reactions are rare.
Persons with moderate to severe illness should not be
vaccinated until their conditions improve. However, minor
illnesses, such as upper respiratory infections, are not a
contraindication to vaccination.
No information is available about the safety of the vaccine in
pregnant women. However, because the vaccine contains
only particles that do not cause HBV infection, there should
be no risk. In contrast, if a pregnant woman acquires HBV
infection, it may cause severe disease in the mother and
chronic infection in the newborn baby. Therefore, pregnant
women who are otherwise eligible can be given hepatitis B
vaccine.
Hepatitis B vaccine does not contain live virus, so it may be
used in persons with immunodeﬁciency. However, response
to vaccination in such persons may be suboptimal.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Hepatitis B vaccines should be stored refrigerated at 2°-8°C
(35°-46°F) but not frozen. Freezing destroys the potency of
the vaccine.

than 12 months old to a primary caregiver with acute hepati-
tis B.
All candidates for HBIG are, by deﬁnition, in a high-risk
category, and should therefore be considered for vaccine as
well.
Immune globulin (IG) is prepared by cold ethanol fraction-
ation of pooled plasma and contains low titers of anti-HBs.
Because titers are relatively low, IG has no valid current use
for HBV disease, unless hepatitis B immune globulin is
unavailable.
Maternal screening
In 1988, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP), in consultation with the American College of
Obstetrics and Gynecology and the American Academy of
Pediatrics, recommended that all pregnant women should be
routinely tested for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit, in
each pregnancy. If a woman has not been screened
prenatally, or the results are unavailable at the time of
delivery, HBsAg testing should be done at admission for
delivery. This identiﬁes infants born to HBsAg positive
mothers for prompt prophylaxis at birth, as well as at 1 and
6 month follow-ups. Also, household members and sexual
partners of HBV carriers can be evaluated for the need for
hepatitis B vaccine.

Hib
AEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE WAS FIRST DESCRIBED BY
H Pfeiffer in 1892. During a major outbreak of inﬂu-
enza, he found the bacteria in the sputum of
patients, and proposed a causal association between this
species and the clinical syndrome known as inﬂuenza.
The organism was given the name Haemophilus by Winslow,
et al., in 1920. It was not until 1933 that Smith, et al.,
established that inﬂuenza is caused by a virus and that
H. inﬂuenzae is only a secondary invader.
In the 1930s, Margaret Pittman showed that H. inﬂuenzae
could be isolated in encapsulated and unencapsulated forms.
She identiﬁed six capsular types (a-f), and observed that
virtually all isolates from cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) and blood
were of the capsular type b.
Before the introduction of effective vaccines, H. inﬂuenzae
type b (Hib) was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis
and other invasive bacterial disease among children <5 years
of age. Almost all serious infections were among children
<5 years of age; approximately one in 200 children developed
invasive Hib disease before the age of 5 years. Two-thirds of
cases were among children <18 months of age.

\
Haemophilus Inﬂuenzae type b
Pathogenesis of Invasive Disease
- Organisms colonize nasopharynx
- Organisms invade bloodstream and
cause distant infection
- Antecedent URI may be a contributing
factor

/
The outermost structure of H. inﬂuenzae is a polysaccharide
capsule, which is responsible for virulence and immunity.
Six antigenically and biochemically distinct capsular polysac-
charide serotypes have been described, which are designated
types a through f. Type b organisms account for 95% of all
strains that cause invasive disease.
Pathogenesis
The portal of entry is the nasopharynx. Organisms colonize
the nasopharynx and may remain only transiently or for
several months in the absence of symptoms (“asymptomatic
carrier”). Hib strains occur in the nasopharynx with a preva-
lence of O.5%-3% in normal infants and children, uncom-
monly in adults. Nontypable (nonencapsulated) strains are
also frequent inhabitants of the human respiratory tract and
are generally non-invasive.
Invasive disease
The exact mode of invasion to the blood stream is unknown.
Antecedent viral or mycoplasma infection of the upper respi-
ratory tract may be a contributing factor.
The bacteria spread in the bloodstream to distant sites in the
body. Meninges are especially likely to be affected.
Immunity
The most striking feature of Hib disease is age-dependent
susceptibility. Passive protection of some infants is provided
by transplacentally acquired maternal IgG antibodies and
breast-feeding during the ﬁrst 6 months of life.
Peak attack rates occur at 6-7 months of age, declining
thereafter. Hib disease is uncommon beyond 5 years of age.
The presumed reason for this age distribution is the acquisi-
tion of humoral immunity to Hib with increasing age.
Anticapsular antibodies
Antibodies to Hib capsular polysaccharide are protective.
The precise level of antibody required for protection against
invasive disease is not clearly established. However, a
geometric mean titer (GMT) of 1 ug/mL 3 weeks postvaccina-
tion correlated with protection in studies following vaccina-
tion with unconjugated PRP vaccine and suggests long-term
protection from invasive disease.


## p. xlviii (#149) #########################################

HAEMOPHILUS lNFLUENZAE
Acquisition of both anticapsular and serum bactericidal
antibody is inversely related to the age-speciﬁc incidence of
Hib disease.
Most children have acquired “natural” immunity by 5-6 years
of age through asymptomatic exposure to Hib bacteria. Since
only a relatively small proportion of children carry Hib at
any time, it has been postulated that exposure to organisms
that share common antigenic structures with the capsule of
Hib (so-called “cross-reacting organisms”) may also stimulate
the development of anticapsular antibodies against Hib.
Natural exposure to Hib also induces antibodies to outer
membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharides, and other antigens
on the surface of the bacterium.
The genetic constitution of the host may also be important in
susceptibility to infection with Hib. Risk for Hib disease has
been associated with a number of genetic markers, but the
mechanism of these associations is unknown. No single
genetic relationship regulating susceptibility or immune
responses to polysaccharide antigens has yet been convinc-
ingly demonstrated.
Clinical Features
Invasive disease caused by H. influenzae type b can affect
many organ systems. The most common types of invasive
disease are meningitis, epiglottitis, pneumonia, arthritis,
and cellulitis.
Meningitis is infection of the membranes covering the brain
and is the most common clinical manifestation of Hib dis-
ease, accounting for 50%-65% of cases. Hallmarks of Hib
meningitis are fever, decreased mental status, and stiff neck.
The mortality rate is 2%-5%, despite appropriate antimicro-
bial therapy. Neurologic sequelae occur in 15%-30% of
survivors.
Epiglottitis is an infection and swelling of the epiglottis, the
tissue in the throat that covers and protects the larynx
during swallowing. Epiglottitis causes life-threatening
airway obstruction.
Septic arthritis (joint infection), cellulitis (rapidly progress-
ing skin lesions which usually involve face, head, or neck),
and pneumonia (which can be mild focal or severe
empyema) are common manifestations of invasive disease.
Osteomyelitis (bone infection), and pericarditis (infection of
the sac covering the heart) are less common forms of invasive
disease.

Otitis media and acute bronchitis due to H. inﬂuenzae are
generally caused by nontypable strains. Hib strains account
for only 5%-10% of H. inﬂuenzae causing otitis media.
The case-fatality rate for invasive H. inﬂuenzae disease is 2%
to 5%.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Culture
Primary criterion for diagnosis is isolation of the organism
from a normally sterile body site that is the infectious focus
(e.g., CSF, blood, pleural ﬂuid, joint ﬂuid, subcutaneous
tissue ﬂuid).
Gram stain of smears of ﬂuid (e.g. , CSF, pleural ﬂuid, joint
ﬂuid).
Antigen detection
Antigen detection may be used as an adjunct to culture,
particularly in the diagnosis of patients who have been
partially treated with antimicrobials where the organism
may not be viable on culture. Two types are available.
1. Latex agglutination is a rapid, sensitive, and specific
method to detect Hib capsular polysaccharide antigen in
CSF, serum, urine, pleural ﬂuid, joint ﬂuid, etc.
2. Counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) is similar to latex
agglutination, but is less sensitive, longer, and more difficult
to‘ perform.
Treatment
Hospitalization is generally required. Antimicrobial therapy
with chloramphenicol or an effective third-generation cepha-
losporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) should be begun immedi-
ately.
Ampicillin-resistant strains are now common throughout the
United States. Thus, children with life-threatening illness in
which Hib may be the etiologic agent should not receive
amoxicillin as initial empiric therapy.
Treatment course is usually 10 to 14 days.

Epidemiology
K
- Reservoir
Occurrence
Hib disease occurs Worldwide. However, the incidence
outside the United States and Europe has not been deter-
mined.
- Transmission
- Temporal pattern
Reservoir
- Communicability
\
Humans are the only known reservoir. Hib does not survive
in the environment on inanimate surfaces.
Transmission
Primary mode is presumably by respiratory droplet spread,
although ﬁrm evidence for this mechanism is lacking.
Temporal pattern
Several studies have described a bimodal seasonal pattern in
the United States, with one peak between September and
December, and a second peak between March and May. The
reason for this bimodal pattern is not known.
Communicability
The contagious potential of invasive Hib disease is consid-
ered to be limited. However, certain circumstances, particu-
larly close contact with a case (e.g., household, day-care, or
institutional setting) can lead to outbreaks or direct second-
ary transmission of the disease.
Secular Trends in the United States
Haemophilus inﬂuenzae infections became nationally report-
able in 1991. Serotype-speciﬁc reporting continues to be
incomplete. However, most reported infections probably
represent type b disease.
Prior to the availability of national reporting data, several
areas carried out active surveillance for H. inﬂuenzae dis-
ease, which allowed estimates of disease nationwide. In the
early 1980s, it was estimated that about 20,000 cases oc-
curred annually in the United States, primarily among
children younger than 5 years of age (40-50 cases per
100,000 population). The incidence of invasive Hib disease
began to fall dramatically in the late 1980s, coincident with
licensure of conjugate Hib vaccines. In 1993, a total of 1,419
cases were reported. This decrease was due to increasing
levels of vaccine-induced immunity among young children.

There also is good evidence that Hib vaccines decrease the

Incidence is strikingly age-dependent. Up to 60% of invasive
disease occurs before age 12 months, with a peak occurrence
in children 6-11 months of age. Children over

Risk Factors
Risk factors for Hib disease include host factors and expo-
sure factors which increase the likelihood of exposure to Hib.
Exposure factors include household crowding, large house-
hold size, day-care attendance, low socioeconomic status, low'
parental education levels, and school-aged siblings.
Host factors include race-ethnicity (elevated risk in blacks,
Hispanics, Native Americans — possibly confounded by
socioeconomic variables that are associated both with race/
ethnicity and with Hib disease), chronic diseases (e.g., sickle
cell anemia, antibody deﬁciency syndromes, malignancies,
especially during chemotherapy), and possibly gender
(male > female).
Protective Factors (Effect Limited to <6 Months of
Age) include breast-feeding and passively acquired maternal
antibody.

HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE
Secondary spread of Hib disease
Secondary disease is deﬁned as illness within 1-60 days
following contact with an ill child, and accounts for less than
5% of all invasive Hib disease. Among household contacts,
six studies have found a secondary attack rate of 0.3% in the
month following disease onset of the index case, which is
about GOO-fold higher than the risk for the general popula-
tion. Attack rates varied substantially with age, from 3.7%
among children under 2 years of age to 0% among contacts
over the age of 6 years. In these household contacts, 64% of
secondary cases occurred within the ﬁrst week (excluding the
ﬁrst 24 hours) of disease onset in the index case, 20% during
the second week, and 16% during the third and fourth weeks.
There are conﬂicting data regarding the risk of secondary
transmission among day-care contacts. Secondary attack
rates have varied from 0% to as high as 2.7%. Most studies
seem to suggest that day-care contacts are at relatively low
risk for secondary transmission of Hib disease.
Haemophilus influenzae type b Vaccine
A pure polysaccharide vaccine (HbPV) was licensed in the
United States in 1985. The vaccine was not effective among
children younger than 18 months of age. Estimates of efﬁ-
cacy in older children varied widely, from 88% to -69%
(a negative efﬁcacy implies greater disease risk for vaccinees
than nonvaccinees). HbPV was used until 1988, but is no
longer available in the United States.
The characteristics of the Hib polysaccharide was similar to
other polysaccharide vaccines (e.g., pneumococcal, meningo-
coccal). The response to the vaccine was typical of a
T-independent antigen, most notably an age-dependent
response, and poor immunogenicity in children <2 years of
age. In addition, no boost in antibody titer was observed
with repeated doses, the antibody which was produced was
relatively low-afﬁnity IgM, and switching to IgG production
was poor.
Haemophilus influenzae type b
polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines
Conjugation is the process of chemically bonding a polysac-
charide (which is a poor antigen) to a protein “carrier,” which
is a more effective antigen. This process changes polysaccha-
ride from a T-independent to a T~dependent antigen, and
greatly improves immunogenicity, particularly in young
children. In addition, repeat doses of Hib conjugate vaccines
elicit booster responses, and allow maturation of class-
speciﬁc immunity with predominance of IgG antibody. The
Hib conjugates also cause carrier priming and elicit antibody
to “useful” carrier protein.

The first Hib conjugate vaccine (PRP-D, ProHIBIT) was

recommended for use in infants.
Since 1990, four additional conjugate Hib vaccines have been
licensed for use in infants as young as 6 Weeks of age. Three
of these vaccines are chemically and immunologically dis-
tinct (ActHIB and OmniHIB are identical vaccines marketed
by different companies).

Limited information is available regarding the interchange-
ability of different Hib vaccines for the primary series at
2, 4, and 6 months of age. Preliminary ﬁndings from two
studies suggest that the vaccination series consisting of PRP-
OMP at 2 months, followed by either PRP-T or HbOC at
4 months and 6 months, induces adequate anti-PRP antibody
responses. The sequence HbOC, PRP-T, PRP-T was also
immunogenic after the complete primary series was adminis-
tered. This information suggests that any combination of
three doses of Hib conjugate vaccines licensed for use among
infants will provide adequate protection.
Efficacy of Hib conjugate vaccines
As noted above, efﬁcacy of the PRP-D conjugate (ProHIBIT®)
has varied with the age of the population studied. Among
children aged 15-60 months, estimates of efﬁcacy range from
74%-96%. In comparison, among Alaskan Natives vacci-
nated at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, efficacy was estimated at
only 35%. Consequently, PRP-D is approved for use only in
children 12 months-5 years of age.
PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB®) was shown to be 93%-100% efﬁca-
cious in Navajo infants (a population at particularly high
risk of disease) vaccinated at 2 and 4 months of age. Two
studies have indicated a point estimate of efﬁcacy of 97%


## p. xlviii (#155) #########################################

HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE
following the administration of two doses of HbOC
(HibTITER®) (in Finland), or three doses of vaccine (in the
United States) to infants.
Although the trials evaluating PRP-T (ActHIBTM,
OmniHIBTM) vaccine efficacy among infants in the United
States were terminated early, no cases of invasive Hib dis-
ease were reported among more than 6,200 Vaccinees at the
time of termination. In a trial in Great Britain, PRP-T was
protective in infants vaccinated at ages 2, 3, and 4 months.
Efficacy of PRP-T was also suggested in a nationwide immu-
nization program that was implemented in Finland in J anu-
ary 1990. There were no reported cases of invasive Hib
disease among more than 97,000 infants who received two
doses of PRP-T. Two children developed disease after one
dose of vaccine.
Combined DTP-Hib vaccines
Two combined DTP-Hib products have been licensed by the
FDA. TETRAMUNETM (Lederle-Praxis) is DTP (Lederle)
combined with HbOC. In November 1998, the FDA approved
the reconstitution of PRP-T (Pasteur Mérieux Vaccins) with
the DTP manufactured by Connaught Laboratories.
ACTHibTM is distributed as ten single-dose vials of
lyophylized PRP-T, packaged together with a multidose vial
of DTP.
Although no efficacy studies are available for the combina-
tion vaccines, immunogenicity data suggest that both combi-
nation vaccines will provide protection against Hib disease,
diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, similar to that of sepa-
rately administered Hib and DTP vaccines.
Simultaneous administration
Large prelicensure and postlicensure studies have demon-
strated the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of each of
the licensed Hib conjugate vaccines administered to infants
concurrently with DTP vaccine and oral polio vaccine (OPV),
as well as the safety and immunogenicity of combined DTP-
Hib when administered concurrently with OPV in recom-
mended schedules. More limited data also support the safety
and immunogenicity of Hib conjugate vaccines when admin-
istered simultaneously with hepatitis B vaccine to infants,
and with DTP, OPV, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)
and-or hepatitis B vaccine when administered at ages
12-18 months.

\ Any Hib conjugate vaccine may be used as the booster dose
after a primary series. When possible, the Hib conjugate
vaccine used at the ﬁrst vaccination should be used for all
subsequent vaccinations in the primary series. However,
any combination of three doses of Hib conjugate vaccines
licensed for use among infants will provide adequate protec-
tion.
When either Hib vaccine or combined DTP-Hib is used, the
vaccine should be administered intramuscularly using a
separate syringe and administered at a separate site from
any other concurrent vaccinations.
Infants born prematurely should be vaccinated according to
the schedule recommended for other infants, beginning at
age 2 months.
Because natural infection does not always result in develop-
ment of protective anti-PRP antibody levels, children
<24 months of age who develop invasive Hib disease should
be considered unimmunized and receive Hib vaccine as
recommended in the schedule. Vaccination of these children
should start as soon as possible during the convalescent
phase of the illness.
Hib vaccine is immunogenic in patients with increased risk
for invasive disease, such as those with sickle-cell disease,
leukemia, human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) infection,
and in those who have had splenectomies. However, in

HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE
persons with HIV infection, immunogenicity varies with
stage of infection and degree of immunocompromise. Effi-
cacy studies have not been performed in populations with
increased risk of invasive disease.
Children who attend day care are at increased risk of Hib
disease. Therefore, efforts should be made to ensure that all
day care attendees <5 years of age are fully vaccinated.
HbOC or PRP-T
Previously unvaccinated infants aged 2-6 months should
receive three doses of vaccine administered 2 months apart,
followed by a booster dose at age 12-15 months, at least
2 months after the last vaccination. Unvaccinated children
aged 7 -11 months should receive two doses of vaccine,
2 months apart, followed by a booster dose at age
12-18 months, at least 2 months after the last vaccination.
Unvaccinated children aged 12-14 months should receive two
doses of vaccine, at least 2 months apart. Any previously
unvaccinated child aged 15-59 months should receive a
single dose of vaccine.
PRP-OMP
Previously unvaccinated infants aged 2-6 months should
receive two doses of vaccine administered at least 2 months
apart. Although PRP-OMP induces a substantial antibody
response after one dose, all children should receive all recom-
mended doses of PRP-OMP. Because of the substantial
antibody response after one dose, it may be advantageous to
use PRP-OMP vaccine in populations that are known to be at
increased risk for disease during early infancy (e.g., Alaskan
Natives). A booster dose should be administered to all
children at 12-15 months of age at least 2 months after the
last vaccination. Unvaccinated children aged 7 -11 months
should receive two doses of vaccine, 2 months apart, followed
by a booster dose at 12-18 months of age, at least 2 months
after the last dose. Unvaccinated children aged12-14 months
should receive two doses of vaccine, 2 months apart. Any
previously unvaccinated child 15-59 months of age should
receive a single dose of vaccine.
PRP-D
One dose of PRP-D may be administered to unvaccinated
children aged 15-59 months. This vaccine may be used as a
booster dose at 12-18 months of age following a two- or three-
dose primary series, regardless of the vaccine used in the
primary series. This vaccine is not licensed for use among
infants because of its limited immunogenicity and variable
protective efficacy in this age group.

HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE
TE TRAMUNET M and ACTHibTM
The DTP-Hib combination vaccines (TETRAMUNETM and
ACTHibTM) may be used for routine vaccination of infants,
beginning at age 2 months, to prevent diphtheria, tetanus,
pertussis, and invasive Hib disease. Previously unvacci-
nated infants aged 2-6 months should receive three doses
administered at least 2 months apart. An additional dose
should be administered at 12-15 months of age, after at least
a 6-month interval following the third dose. Alternatively,
DTaP and Hib vaccine can be administered as separate
injections at 15 months of age. DTaP is preferred for doses
four and ﬁve of the ﬁve-dose DTP series.
Combined DTP-Hib vaccines may be used to complete an
infant immunization series started with any Hib vaccine
(licensed for use in this age group) and with any DTP vaccine
if both vaccines are to be administered simultaneously.
Completion of the primary series using the same Hib vac-
cine, however, is preferable. Conversely, any DTP vaccine
may be used to complete a series initiated with
TETRAMUNETM or ACTHibTM (see the ACIP's 1991 Diphthe-
ria, Tetanus, and Pertussis: Recommendations for Vaccine
Use and Other Preventive Measures).
If the ﬁrst vaccination is delayed beyond age 6 months, the
schedule of vaccination for previously unimmunized children
should be followed (see below).

DTP or DTaP should be administered at 4-6 years of age, before kindergarten or elementary
school. This booster is not necessary if the fourth vaccinating dose was administered after the
fourth birthday.

Adverse Events Following Vaccination
Adverse reactions to any of the four Hib conjugate vaccines
are generally uncommon. Swelling, redness, and-or pain
have been reported in 5%-30% of recipients and usually
resolve within 12-24 hours. Systemic reactions such as fever
and irritability are infrequent. Available information on side
effects and adverse reactions suggests that the risks for local
and systemic events following TETRAMUNETM and
ACTHibTM administration are similar to those following
concurrent administration of its individual component vac-
cines, and may be due largely to the pertussis component of
the DTP vaccine.
All serious adverse events that occur after receipt of any
vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events
Reporting System (VAERS). See Appendix H for information.
Contraindications to Vaccination
Vaccination with a speciﬁc Hib conjugate vaccine is contrain-
dicated in persons known to have experienced anaphylaxis
following a prior dose of that vaccine. Vaccination should be
delayed in children with moderate or severe illnesses. Minor
illnesses (e.g., mild upper-respiratory infection) are not
contraindications to vaccination.
Contraindications and precautions for the use of
TETRAMUNETM and ACTHibTM are the same as those for its
individual component vaccines (i.e., DTP and Hib).
Surveillance and Reporting of Hib disease
Invasive Hib disease is a reportable condition in 43 states.
All health care Workers should report any case of invasive
Hib disease to local and state health departments.
Rifampin prophylaxis
Several studies have shown that rifampin eradicated Hib
carriage in 295% of contacts of primary Hib cases, including
children in day-care facilities.
Contacts who develop symptoms suggestive of invasive Hib
disease, such as fever or headache, should be evaluated
promptly.
Rifampin chemoprophylaxis for household contacts is no
longer indicated if all contacts aged <4 years are fully vacci-
nated against Hib disease. A child is considered fully immu-
nized against Hib disease following (a) at least one dose of

of conjugate vaccine at <12 months of age, followed by a
booster dose at 12 months of age. In households with one or
more infants <12 months of age (regardless of vaccination
status) or with a child aged 1-3 years who is inadequately
vaccinated, all household contacts should receive rifampin
prophylaxis following a case of invasive Hib disease that
occurs in any family member. The recommended dose is
20 mg-kg as a single daily dose (maximal daily dose 600 mg)
for 4 days. Neonates (<1 month of age) should receive
10 mg-kg once daily for 4 days.
The use of rifampin in day-care classrooms is controversial.
If a case of Hib disease has occurred, and any children less
than 2 years of age have been exposed, all parents should be
notiﬁed. Although data on risk are not optimal, all students
(regardless of age) and staff in the classroom should receive
rifampin prophylaxis according to the above regimen. How-
ever, rifampin prophylaxis is not necessary if all children
<4 years of age are fully immunized.
Rifampin is contraindicated in pregnant women, as its effect
on the fetus has not been established and it is teratogenic in
laboratory animals.
Rifampin prophylaxis should be instituted as rapidly as
possible. If more than 14 days have passed since the last
contact with the index case, the benefit of rifampin prophy-
laxis is likely to be decreased.
The index case should be treated with the same rifampin
regimen before discharge from the hospital, since antimicro-
bials used to treat invasive disease do not reliably eradicate
carriage.
Children in day-care classrooms who are to receive chemo-
prophylaxis and who have received the Hib vaccine should
also receive rifampin. However, if all children
<4 years of age are fully immunized, chemoprophylaxis is not
necessary.
Side effects may occur in up to 20% of recipients, and include
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness.
Rifampin gets into body ﬂuids exceptionally well and usually
causes orange discoloration of urine; it may cause discolora-
tion of soft contact lenses and lens implants or ineffective-
ness of oral contraceptives.

Chapter
Influenza
name, “inﬂuenza,” originated in 15th century Italy, from
an epidemic attributed to “inﬂuence of the stars.” The ﬁrst
pandemic that clearly ﬁts the description of inﬂuenza was in
1580. At least four pandemics of inﬂuenza occurred in the
19th century. The pandemic of “Spanish ﬂu” in 1918-1919
caused an estimated 21 million deaths worldwide.
INFLUENZA IS A HIGHLY INFECTIOUS VIRAL ILLNESS. THE
Smith, Andrews, and Laidlaw isolated inﬂuenza A virus in
ferrets in 1933, and Francis isolated inﬂuenza B virus in
1936. In 1940 Burnet discovered that inﬂuenza virus could
be grown in embryonated hens’ eggs. This led to the study of
the characteristics of the virus and the development of
inactivated vaccines. Evidence of the protective efﬁcacy of
inactivated vaccines was produced in the 1950s.
Influenza Virus
Inﬂuenza is a single-stranded, helically shaped, RNA virus
of the orthomyxovirus family. Basic antigen types A, B, and
C are determined by the nuclear material. Subtypes are
determined by surface antigens on Type A inﬂuenza. Three
types of hemagglutinin (H) in humans are H1, H2, and H3,
and have a role in virus attachment to cells. Two types of
neuraminidase (N), N1 and N2, have a role in virus penetra-
tion into cells.
Influenza A
Inﬂuenza A causes moderate to severe illness, and affects
all age groups. The virus can infect both humans and some
animals, such as pigs.

Influenza B
Inﬂuenza B generally causes milder disease than type A,
and primarily affects children. Inﬂuenza B is more stable
than inﬂuenza A, with decreased antigenic drifting and
consequent immunologic stability. It affects only humans. It
is possibly associated with Reye syndrome.
Influenza C
Inﬂuenza C is rarely reported as a cause of human illness,
probably because most cases are subclinical. It has not been
associated with epidemic disease.
The nomenclature to describe the type of inﬂuenza virus is
expressed in this order: ( 1) virus type, (2) geographic origin,
(3) strain number, (4) year of isolation, and (5) virus subtype.
Antigenic changes
Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase periodically change,
apparently due to sequential evolution within immune or
partially immune populations. Antigenic mutants emerge
and are selected as the predominant virus to the extent that
they differ from antecedent virus which is suppressed by
speciﬁc antibody arising in the population. This cycle re-
peats continuously. In interpandemic periods, mutants arise
by serial point mutations in the RNA coding for hemaggluti-
nin. At irregular intervals of 10 to 40 years, viruses showing
major antigenic differences from prevalent subtypes appear
and, because the population does not have protective anti-
body against these new antigens, cause pandemic disease in
all age groups.
Antigenic shift is a major change in one or both surface
antigens (H and-or N) that occurs at varying intervals,
probably due to genetic recombination between different
inﬂuenza A viruses. Antigenic shifts usually result in world-
wide pandemics.
Antigenic drift is a minor change in surface antigens that
occurs between major shifts and may result in epidemics,
since incomplete protection remains from past exposures to
similar viruses. Drift occurs in all three types of inﬂuenza
virus (A,B,C).

[NFL UENZA m
Pathogenesis
Following respiratory transmission, the virus attaches and
penetrates respiratory epithelial cells in the trachea and
bronchi. Viral replication occurs, which results in the de-
struction of the host cell. Viremia does not occur.
Virus is shed in respiratory secretions for 5 to 10 days.
Clinical Features
The incubation period for inﬂuenza is usually 2 days, but
can vary from 1 to 5 days.
The severity of inﬂuenza illness depends on the prior immu-
nologic experience with antigenically related virus variants.
In general, only around 50% of infected persons will develop
the classic clinical symptoms of inﬂuenza.
“Classic” inﬂuenza disease is characterized by the abrupt
onset of fever, myalgia, sore throat, and nonproductive
cough. The fever is usually 101°-102°F, and accompanied by
prostration. The onset of fever is often so abrupt that the
exact hour is recalled by the patient. Myalgias mainly affect
the back muscles. Cough is believed to be a result of tracheal
epithelial destruction. Additional symptoms may include
rhinorrhea (runny nose), headache, substernal chest burn-
ing, ocular symptoms (e.g., eye pain and sensitivity to light)
and intestinal symptoms.
Course
Systemic symptoms and temperature usually last from 2 to
3 days, rarely more than 5 days. They may be decreased by
such medications as aspirin or acetaminophen. Aspirin
should not be used for infants, children, or teenagers, be-
cause they may be at risk for contracting Reye syndrome
following an inﬂuenza infection. Recovery is usually rapid,
but some may have lingering depression and asthenia (lack
of strength or energy) for several weeks.
Complications
The most frequent complication of inﬂuenza is pneumonia,
most commonly secondary bacterial pneumonia
(e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or
Staphylococcus aureus). Primary inﬂuenza viral pneu-
monia is an uncommon complication with a high fatality
rate.

Reye syndrome is a complication that occurs almost exclu-
sively in children, primarily in association with inﬂuenza B
(and Varicella zoster), and presents with severe vomiting
which may progress to coma, due to swelling of the brain.
Myocarditis, inﬂammation of the muscles of the heart, may
occur.
Another possible complication includes worsening of chronic
bronchitis and other chronic pulmonary diseases.
Death is reported in 0.5-1 per 1000 cases. The majority of
deaths occur in persons >65 years of age.
Impact of Influenza
An increase in mortality typically accompanies inﬂuenza
epidemics. Increased mortality results not only from inﬂu-
enza and pneumonia, but also from cardiopulmonary and
other chronic diseases that can be exacerbated by inﬂuenza.
It is estimated that >10,000 inﬂuenza-associated deaths
occurred during each of seven epidemics between 197 7 and
1988, and >40,000 inﬂuenza-associated deaths occurred
during each of two of these epidemics. Over 80% of the
deaths attributed to pneumonia and inﬂuenza occurred
among persons 65 years of age or older.
During major epidemics, hospitalization rates increased 2- to
5-fold. In nursing homes, the attack rate may be as high as
60%, with up to 30% fatality rates. The cost of a severe
epidemic has been estimated to be $12 billion.
In 1989, inﬂuenza and pneumonia ranked sixth among
causes of death in the United States (crude mortality rate).
Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of inﬂuenza is usually suspected on the basis
of characteristic clinical ﬁndings, particularly if inﬂuenza
has been reported in the community.
Virus isolation
Virus can be cultured from throat and nasopharyngeal swabs
obtained within 3 days of onset of illness. Culture is per-
formed by inoculation of amniotic or allantoic sac of
10-11-day-old chick embryos or certain cell cultures that
support viral replication. It requires a minimum of 48 hours
to demonstrate virus, and 1 to 2 additional days to identify
the virus type. Thus, culture is helpful in deﬁning the
etiology of local epidemics, but not in individual case
management.


## p. xlviii (#165) #########################################

INFLUENZA
Serologic confirmation of inﬂuenza requires demonstra-
tion of a significant rise in inﬂuenza IgG. The acute speci-
men should be taken less than 5 days from onset and a
convalescent specimen taken 10-14, or, preferably, 21 days
following onset.
Complement Fixation (CF) and Hemagglutination
Inhibition (HI) are the serologic tests most commonly used.
The key test is HI, which depends on the ability of the virus
to agglutinate human or chicken erythrocytes and inhibition
of this process by specific antibody. Diagnosis requires at
least a 4-fold rise in antibody titer.
Direct antigen testing for type A virus
Recently, rapid diagnostic testing for inﬂuenza A antigen has
become available and should permit those in office and clinic
settings to assess the need for antiviral use in patients with
inﬂuenza A infection in a timely manner (see section on
Antiviral Agents for Inﬂuenza A).
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Inﬂuenza occurs throughout the world.
Reservoir
Humans are the only known reservoir of inﬂuenza types B
and C. Inﬂuenza A may infect both humans and animals.
Transmission
Inﬂuenza is transmitted via aerosolized or droplet transmis-
sion from the respiratory tract of infected persons. A less
important mode of transmission of droplets is by direct
contact.
Temporal pattern
Inﬂuenza peaks from December to March in temperate
climates, but may occur earlier or later. It occurs throughout
the year in tropical areas.
Communicability
Maximum communicability occurs 1-2 days before onset to
4-5 days thereafter. There is no carrier state.

Pandemic influenza
In the past 100 years, there have been major pandemics in
1889-1891, 1918-1920, 1957-1958, and 1968-1969. A
pandemic occurs following antigenic shift, starts from a
single focus and spreads along routes of travel. Typically,
there are high attack rates involving all age groups and
mortality is usually markedly increased. Severity is not
greater in the individual, but because large numbers of
people are infected, the number, if not the proportion, of
severe and fatal cases will be large. Onset may occur in any
season of the year. Secondary and tertiary waves may occur
over a period of 1-2 years, usually in the winter.
Epidemic influenza
Typically in epidemics, inﬂuenza attack rates are lower than
in pandemics. There is usually a rise in excess mortality.
The major impact is observed in morbidity, with high attack
rates and excess rates of hospitalization, especially for adults
with respiratory disease. Absenteeism from work and school
is high, with an increase in visits to health care providers.
In the Northern Hemisphere, epidemics usually occur in late
fall and continue through early spring. In the Southern
Hemisphere, epidemics usually occur 6 months before or
after those in the Northern Hemisphere.
Sporadic outbreaks can occasionally localize to families,
schools, and isolated communities.
Secular Trends in the United States
A clear association exists between inﬂuenza and excess
mortality. Ten thousand or more excess deaths have been
documented in each of 19 different epidemics during the
years 1957-1986; more than 40,000 excess deaths occurred in
each of several recent epidemics. Outbreaks in nursing
homes have shown attack rates as high as 60%, with case-
fatality ratios as high as 30%.
There is a documented association between inﬂuenza and
increased morbidity in “high-risk” adults. Hospitalization for
adults with high-risk medical conditions increases 2-fold to
5-fold during major epidemics.
The impact of inﬂuenza in the United States is quantiﬁed by
measuring pneumonia and inﬂuenza (P and I) deaths. Death
certiﬁcate data are collected from 121 U.S. cities with popu-
lations of >100,000 (approximately 70,000,000). P and I
deaths include all deaths for which pneumonia is listed as a
primary or underlying cause, or for which inﬂuenza is listed
on the death certiﬁcate.

An “expected” ratio of deaths due to P and I compared with
all deaths for a given period of time is determined. The
epidemic threshold for inﬂuenza seasons is generally esti-
mated at 1.645 standard deviations above the values pro-
jected on the basis of a periodic regression model applied to
observed P and I deaths for the previous 5-year period,
excluding periods during inﬂuenza outbreaks.
Inﬂuenza epidemic activity is signaled when the ratio of
deaths due to P and I exceeds the threshold ratio for 2 con-
secutive weeks.
Influenza Vaccine
The inﬂuenza vaccines available in the United States are
composed of inactivated inﬂuenza virus. Two types of inacti-
vated inﬂuenza virus vaccines are available. Whole-virus
vaccines used today are prepared using chick embryo or
allantoic ﬂuid. The viruses are subjected to zonal gradient
centrifugation or chromatography and subsequently inacti-
vated. Disrupted, or split-virus vaccines are prepared using
organic solvents or detergents. Split vaccines are associated
with fewer adverse events, perhaps because of disturbance of
the spatial arrangement of the viral lipids. They are most
useful in children 12 years of age or under, in whom whole-
cell vaccines have prohibitive reactogenic effects.

A cold attenuated live vaccine has been under development
for over 20 years. It is widely used in Russia for adult immu-
nization. This vaccine is not yet licensed in the United
States, but it may be available in the next few years.
Vaccines may contain a single strain of inﬂuenza A if a
pandemic is suspected. In interpandemic years, they are
usually composed of viruses closely related antigenically to
circulating strains of inﬂuenza A and B. In recent years,
inﬂuenza vaccine has contained three inactivated viruses -
two type A (H3N2 and H1N1), and one type B. The vaccine
contains 15 pg of each hemagglutinin antigen per 0.5 ml
dose. It contains thimerosal as a preservative and minute
amounts of egg protein.
For practical purposes, immunity following inactivated
inﬂuenza vaccination rarely exceeds 1 year. Priming by
prior infection with a closely related strain or prior vaccina-
tion enhances immunologic response after vaccination.
Inﬂuenza vaccine efﬁcacy varies by the similarity of the
vaccine strain(s) to the circulating strain, and the age and
underlying illness of the recipient. Vaccines are effective in
protecting up to 90% of healthy young adult vaccinees from
illness when the vaccine strain is similar to the circulating
strain. However, the vaccine is only 30%-40% effective in
preventing illness among frail elderly persons. Among the
elderly in nursing homes, efﬁcacy has been estimated at
40%-60%.
Although the vaccine is not highly effective in prevention of
clinical illness among the elderly, it is effective in prevention
of complications and death. Among elderly persons, the
vaccine is 50%-60% effective in preventing hospitalization
and 80% effective in preventing death. During a 1982-1983
inﬂuenza outbreak in Genesee County, Michigan, unvacci-
nated nursing home residents were 4.2 times more likely to
die than vaccinated residents.
Vaccine is most effective when it precedes exposure by no
more than 2 to 4 months. It should be offered annually,
beginning in September for routine patient visits. Organized
campaigns for high-risk persons who are routinely accessible
are optimally undertaken from mid-October to mid-Novem-
ber. Vaccine may be given up to and even after inﬂuenza
activity is documented in a region.
The trivalent inﬂuenza vaccine prepared for the 1995-1996
season includes A-Johannesburg-33-94 (H3N2), A-Texas-36/
91-H1N1), and B-Beijing-184-93.

3-8 years Split virus only 0.50 mL 1 or 2 IM
9-12 years Split virus only 0.50 mL 1 IM
>12 years Whole or split 0.50 mL 1 IM

One dose of inﬂuenza vaccine should be administered annu-
ally for persons 9 years of age or older. Children <9 years of
age receiving inﬂuenza vaccine for the ﬁrst time should
receive two doses administered at least 1 month apart.
Because of the lower potential for causing febrile reactions,
only split-virus vaccines should be used for children. They
may be labeled as “split,” “subvirion,” or “puriﬁed-surface-
antigen” vaccine. Immunogenicity and side effects of split-
and whole-virus vaccines are similar among adults when
vaccines are administered at the recommended dosage.
Inactivated vaccine should be given by the intramuscular
(IM) route. Other methods, such as intradermal, subcutane-
ous, topical, or mucosal have not shown superiority in induc-
ing antibody production in unprimed patients.
Vaccine recommendations
Inﬂuenza vaccine is recommended for all persons 65 years
of age or older, regardless of the presence of chronic illness.
Other groups targeted for inﬂuenza vaccine include resi-
dents of long-term care facilities, and persons 6 months
to 18 years of age receiving chronic aspirin therapy
(because of the risk of Reye syndrome following inﬂuenza
infection).
Persons >6 months of age with chronic illness of many
kinds should be vaccinated. These chronic illnesses include
the following:
' pulmonary illnesses, such as emphysema, chronic
bronchitis, or asthma
' cardiovascular illnesses, such as congestive heart
failure
' metabolic diseases, including diabetes mellitus
' renal dysfunction
' hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease, and
' immunosuppression.

ers of home care to high-risk persons (e.g., visiting nurses,
volunteers).
Persons infected with HIV should be vaccinated. Little
information exists regarding the frequency and severity of
inﬂuenza illness in HIV-infected persons, but recent reports
suggest that symptoms may be prolonged and the risk for
complications increased in these persons. Because inﬂuenza
may result in serious illness and complications, vaccination
is a prudent precaution, and may result in protective anti-
body levels in many recipients. Antibody response may be
low in those with advanced disease, but booster doses do not
improve immune response.
Persons who provide essential community services
and students or others in institutional settings (e.g., schools
and colleges) may be considered for vaccination to minimize
disruption of routine activities during outbreaks.
Foreign travelers may want to be vaccinated. The risk of
exposure to inﬂuenza during foreign travel varies, depending
on season of travel and destination. Inﬂuenza can occur
throughout the year in the tropics. In the Southern Hemi-
sphere, inﬂuenza activity peaks in April-September. If not
vaccinated the previous fall-winter, persons (especially those
in high-risk groups) preparing to travel to the tropics at any
time of the year or to the Southern Hemisphere during April-
September, should be considered for inﬂuenza vaccination
before travel. The most current available vaccine should be
used.
Any person who wishes to lessen his-her chance of acquiring
inﬂuenza infection may be vaccinated.
While pregnancy itself does not constitute a high-risk condi-
tion for inﬂuenza, pregnant women who have underlying
medical conditions (listed above) should be vaccinated. A
reasonable precaution to minimize the theoretical risk of
teratogenicity is to administer the vaccine after the ﬁrst
trimester. However, it is undesirable to delay vaccination for
pregnant women with high-risk conditions who will still be
in the ﬁrst trimester when the inﬂuenza season begins.

INFLUENZA
Adverse Events Following Vaccination
Local reactions are the most common adverse events follow-
ing inﬂuenza vaccination. They include soreness, erythema,
and induration at the site of injection. These events are
transient, generally lasting 1 to 2 days. Local reactions are
reported in less than 30% of vaccinees.
Non-speciﬁc systemic symptoms including fever, chills,
malaise, and myalgias are reported in <1% of vaccine recipi-
ents. These symptoms usually occur in those with no previ-
ous exposure to the viral antigens in the vaccine. They
usually occur within 6-12 hours of vaccination and last
1-2 days.
Rarely, immediate hypersensitivity, presumably allergic,
reactions (such as hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, or
systemic anaphylaxis) occur after inﬂuenza vaccination.
These reactions probably result from hypersensitivity to
some vaccine component — the majority are most likely
related to residual egg protein. Although current inﬂuenza
vaccines contain only a small quantity of egg protein, this
protein may induce immediate hypersensitivity reactions
among persons with severe egg allergy. Persons who have
developed hives, had swelling of the lips or tongue, or experi-
enced acute respiratory distress or collapse after eating eggs
should consult a physician for appropriate evaluation to
assist in determining whether vaccination may proceed or
should be deferred. Persons with documented immunoglobu-
lin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to eggs — including
those who have had occupational asthma or other allergic
responses from exposure to egg protein - may also be at
increased risk for reactions from inﬂuenza vaccine, and
similar consultation should be considered. Protocols have
been published for inﬂuenza vaccination of patients who
have egg allergies and medical conditions that place them at
increased risk for inﬂuenza infection or its complications.
The potential exists for hypersensitivity reactions to any
vaccine component. Although exposure to vaccines contain-
ing thimerosal can lead to induction of hypersensitivity, most
patients do not develop reactions to thimerosal administered
as a component of vaccines, even when patch or intradermal
tests for thimerosal indicate hypersensitivity. When it has
been reported, hypersensitivity to thimerosal has usually
consisted of local delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.

/
Unlike the 1976 swine inﬂuenza vaccine, subsequent vac-
cines prepared from other virus strains have not been clearly
associated with an increased frequency of Guillain-Barré
syndrome (GBS). Although inﬂuenza vaccination can inhibit
the clearance of warfarin and theophylline, studies have
failed to show any adverse clinical effects attributable to
these drugs among patients receiving inﬂuenza vaccine.
Contraindications to Vaccination
Persons with a severe allergic reaction to a previous dose of
inﬂuenza vaccine, or to a vaccine component (e.g., eggs)
should not receive inﬂuenza vaccine.
Persons with moderate to severe illnesses normally should
not be vaccinated until their symptoms have decreased.
Pregnant women who have other medical conditions that
increase their risks for complications from inﬂuenza should
be vaccinated, as the vaccine is considered safe for pregnant
women. Regardless of the stage of pregnancy, it is undesir-
able to delay vaccination of pregnant women who have high-
risk conditions and who will still be in the first trimester of
pregnancy when the inﬂuenza season begins.
Year 2000 Objectives
Year 2000 objectives are to increase inﬂuenza vaccination
levels to 60% or higher among high-risk populations (80% in
residents of chronic care facilities) and to reduce epidemic-
related pneumonia and inﬂuenza-related deaths among
persons 65 years of age and older.
Missed Opportunities
Up to 75% of persons at high risk for inﬂuenza or who die
from pneumonia and inﬂuenza may have received care in a
physician’s office during the previous year. One study indi-
cated that all persons who died from pneumonia or inﬂuenza
and did not reside in a nursing home, had at least one medi-
cal visit during the previous year.
Strategies for Improving Influenza Vaccine
Coverage
An average of less than 20% of persons in high-risk groups
receive inﬂuenza vaccine each year. More effective strate-
gies for delivering vaccine to high-risk persons, their health
care providers, and household contacts are needed. Persons
for whom the vaccine is recommended can be identified and
immunized in the following settings:


## p. xlviii (#173) #########################################

INFLUENZA
Outpatient clinics and physicians’ offices
Persons who should receive vaccine should be identiﬁed and
their charts marked; vaccine should be offered beginning in
September and continuing through the inﬂuenza season;
those without regularly scheduled visits should receive
reminders.
Facilities providing episodic or acute care
(e.g., emergency rooms, walk-in clinics).
Nursing homes and other residential long-term care
facilities
Immunization should be routinely provided to all residents
at one period of time immediately preceding the inﬂuenza
season; consent should be obtained at the time of admission.
Acute-care hospitals
Persons for whom vaccine is recommended who are hospital-
ized from September through March should be offered and
encouraged to receive vaccine prior to discharge.
Outpatient facilities providing continuing care to high-risk
patients (e.g., hemodialysis centers, hospital specialty-care
clinics, outpatient rehabilitation programs)
All patients should be offered vaccine shortly before the
onset of the inﬂuenza season.
Visiting nurses and others providing home care to
high-risk persons
They should identify high-risk patients and administer
vaccine in the home, if necessary.
Facilities providing services to persons >65 years of age
(e.g., retirement communities, recreation centers).
Vaccine should be offered at one time period, before the
inﬂuenza season, on-site; alternatively, education-publicity
programs should be conducted.
Clinics and others providing health care for travelers
Indications for inﬂuenza vaccine should be reviewed prior to
travel and vaccine offered, if appropriate.

Administrators of all of the above facilities and organizations
should arrange for inﬂuenza vaccine to be offered to all
personnel before the inﬂuenza season. Additionally, house-
hold members of high-risk persons and others with whom
they will be in contact should receive written information
about why they should receive the vaccine and where to
obtain it.
Antiviral Agents for Influenza A
Amantadine hydrochloride and rimantadine hydrochloride
are antiviral drugs which have speciﬁc activity against
inﬂuenza A viruses. Both drugs interfere with the replica-
tion cycle of type A inﬂuenza viruses, although speciﬁc
mechanisms of their antiviral activity are not completely
understood. Both drugs are 70%-90% effective in preventing
illnesses caused by naturally occurring strains of type A
inﬂuenza viruses. When compared with amantadine,
rimantadine causes fewer side effects in older people. Nei-
ther is effective against type B inﬂuenza. Amantadine and
rimantadine prophylaxis are recommended in the following
situations:
As an adjunct to late vaccination of high-risk persons during
the 2 weeks it takes to develop an antibody response follow-
ing vaccination.
In unvaccinated persons, to reduce the spread of infection
and maintain care for high-risk persons, both in institutions
and at home.
For immunodeﬁcient persons who may have a poor antibody
response to inﬂuenza vaccine.
For persons for whom inﬂuenza vaccine is contraindicated.
Amantadine causes side effects (dizziness, nausea, difﬁculty
concentrating, difﬁculty sleeping) and compliance with a
daily drug is often a problem. Its dosage must be reduced in
those with impaired renal function. This is generally not
true of rimantadine. Amantadine should not be used in lieu
of vaccination. Plans should be established for speciﬁc steps
for its rapid administration to all residents and staff in the
event of an outbreak.
Amantadine and rimantadine can also be used to decrease
the duration of fever and other systemic symptoms due to
inﬂuenza A, if administered shortly after onset of symptoms
(within 48 hours).

INFL UENZA
Nosocomial influenza control
Many patients in general hospitals, and especially in referral
centers, are likely to be high-risk patients. Hospitalized
susceptible patients may acquire inﬂuenza from patients,
hospital employees, or visitors. The preferred method of
control is to vaccinate high-risk patients and medical person-
nel prior to the outbreak. Also consider the following alter-
native strategies:
During community inﬂuenza A epidemic activity, con-
sider using amantadine prophylaxis for high-risk
patients not immunized or immunized too recently to have
protective antibody levels, and for unimmunized hospital
personnel.
Restrict visitors with respiratory illness.
Cohort patients with inﬂuenza for 5 days following onset of
illness.
Postpone elective admission of patients with uncompli-
cated illness.
influenza Surveillance
Reasons for surveillance include (1) to monitor the preva-
lence of circulating strains and to detect new strains neces-
sary for vaccine formulation; (2) to estimate inﬂuenza-
related impact on morbidity, mortality, and economic loss;
(3) to rapidly detect outbreaks necessary to measure vaccine
efﬁcacy; (4) to assist disease control through rapid preventive
action (e.g., chemoprophylaxis of unvaccinated high-risk
patients).
Weekly surveillance reports are received from the states
showing extent of inﬂuenza activity. Reports are classified
into four categories: (1) no cases, (2) sporadic, (3) regional
(cases occurring in counties collectively contributing less
than 50% of a state’s population), (4) widespread (cases
occurring in counties collectively contributing 50% or more of
a state’s population).
Sentinel Family Physician Network
Approximately 141 physicians nationwide provide weekly
telephone information about the number of cases and hospi-
talizations that have occurred in their practices; a subgroup
of physicians collect nasopharyngeal specimens from selected
cases for submission to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) for culture conﬁrmation.

Chapter
Pneumococcal
Disease
NEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE CAUSED BY STREPTOCOCCUS
P pneumoniae, results in wide-spread illness and death
throughout the United States each year. Pneumococcal
disease kills more people in the United States every year -
40,000 or more - than all other vaccine preventable diseases
combined. This bacterium, also called pneumococcus, was
ﬁrst identiﬁed by Pasteur in 1881 from the saliva of a
patient with rabies. The association between the
pneumococcus bacterium and lobar pneumonia was ﬁrst
described by Friedlander and Talamon in 1883, but
pneumococcal pneumonia was confused with other types of
pneumonia until the discovery of the Gram stain in 1884.
From 1915 to 1945, the chemical structure and antigenicity
of the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, its association
with virulence, and the role of bacterial polysaccharides in
human disease were explained. More than 80 serotypes of
pneumococci had been described by 1940.
Efforts to develop effective pneumococcal vaccines began as
early as 1911. However, with the advent of penicillin in the
1940s, interest in the vaccine declined, until it was observed
that many patients still died despite antibiotic treatment.
By the late 1960s, efforts were again being made to develop a
polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. The ﬁrst pneumococcal
vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1977.
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Streptococcus pneumoniae are lancet-shaped, gram-positive,
facultative anaerobic organisms. They are typically observed
in pairs (diplococci) but may also occur singly or in short
chains. Some virulent pneumococci are encapsulated, their
surfaces composed of complex polysaccharides.
Encapsulated organisms are virulent for humans and
experimental animals, whereas organisms without capsular
polysaccharides are not. Capsular polysaccharides are the
primary basis for the pathogenicity of the organism. They
are antigenic and form the basis for classifying pneumococci
by serotypes. At least 83 serotypes have been identiﬁed,

based on their reaction with type-speciﬁc antisera. Type-
speciﬁc antibody to capsular polysaccharide is protective.
These antibodies and complement interact to opsonize
pneumococci, which facilitates phagocytosis and clearance of
the organism. Antibodies to some pneumococcal capsular
polysaccharides may cross-react with related types as well as
with other bacteria, providing protection to additional
serotypes.
Pneumococci are common inhabitants of the respiratory
tract, and may be isolated from the nasopharynx of 5% to
70% of normal adults. Rates of asymptomatic carriage vary
with age, environment, and the presence of upper
respiratory infections. Only 5%-10% of adults without
children are carriers. In schools and orphanages, 27% to
58% of students and residents may be carriers. On military
installations, as many as 50% to 60% of service personnel
may be carriers. The duration of carriage varies and is
generally longer in children than adults. In addition, the
relationship of carriage to the development of natural
immunity is poorly understood.
Clinical Features
The major clinical syndromes of invasive pneumococcal
disease include pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis.
The immunologic mechanism that allows disease to occur in
a carrier is not clearly understood. However, disease most
often occurs when a predisposing condition exists,
particularly pulmonary disease.
Pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common clinical
presentation of invasive pneumococcal disease. The
incubation period of pneumococcal pneumonia is short, about
1 to 3 days. Symptoms generally include an abrupt onset of
fever and shaking chills or rigor. Typically there is a single
rigor, and repeated shaking chills are uncommon. Other
common symptoms include pleuritic chest pain, cough
productive of mucopurulent, rusty sputum, dyspnea
(shortness of breath), tachypnea (rapid breathing), hypoxia
(poor oxygenation), tachycardia (rapid heart rate), malaise,
and weakness. Nausea, vomiting, and headaches occur less
frequently.
An estimated 150,000 - 570,000 cases of pneumococcal
pneumonia occur annually in the United States.
Pneumococci account for up to 36% of adult community-
acquired pneumonia and 50% of hospital-acquired
pneumonia. It is a common bacterial complication of
inﬂuenza and measles. The case-fatality rate is 5%-7%, and
may be much higher in elderly persons. Complications of
pneumococcal pneumonia include empyema (i.e., infection of

PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE
the pleural space), pericarditis, or inﬂammation of the sac
surrounding the heart, and endobronchial obstruction, with
atelectasis and lung abscess formation.
An estimated 16,000 to 55,000 cases of pneumococcal
bacteremia occur each year. Bacteremia occurs in about
25%-30% of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. The
overall mortality rate for bacteremia is about 20%, but may
be as high as 60% in elderly patients. Patients with asplenia
who develop bacteremia may experience a fulminant clinical
course.
Pneumococci accounts for 13%-19% of all cases of bacterial
meningitis in the United States. An estimated 3,000 to
6,000 cases of pneumococcal meningitis occur each year, and
pneumococcal meningitis is now the leading cause of
meningitis in children under ﬁve years of age in the United
States. One-quarter of patients with pneumococcal
meningitis also have pneumonia. The clinical symptoms,
spinal ﬂuid proﬁle and neurologic complications are similar
to other forms of purulent bacterial meningitis. Symptoms
may include headache, lethargy, vomiting, irritability, fever,
nuchal rigidity, cranial nerve signs, seizures and coma. The
mortality rate of pneumococcal meningitis is about 30%, but
may be as high as 80% in elderly persons. Neurologic
sequelae are common among survivors.
Pneumococci account for 30%-60% of episodes of acute otitis
media in infants and children. Complications of
pneumococcal otitis media may include mastoiditis and
meningitis.
Treatment
Penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment of pneumococcal
disease. However, patients who are allergic to penicillin may
be given cephalosporins (depending on the severity of the
penicillin allergy) or erythromycin for pneumonia, and
chloramphenicol for meningitis. The route, dosage, schedule,
and duration of therapy depend on the severity of the illness.
Resistance to penicillin and other antibiotics is rising, and
studies indicate that 5% to 15% of pneumococci are
resistant.
There are no speciﬁc recommendations regarding isolation of
patients with pneumococcal disease, although respiratory
secretions may be infective for 24 hours after the start of
effective antimicrobial therapy.

PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE
Diagnosis
A deﬁnitive diagnosis of infection with Streptococcus
pneumoniae generally relies on isolation of the organism
from blood or other normally sterile body sites. Tests are
also available to detect capsular polysaccharide antigen in
body ﬂuids.
The appearance of lancet-shaped diplococci on Gram stain is
suggestive of pneumococcal infection, but interpretation of
stained sputum specimens may be difﬁcult because of the
presence of normal nasopharyngeal bacteria. The suggested
criteria for obtaining a diagnosis of pneumococcal
pneumonia using the Gram stain includes >25 white blood
cells and <10 epithelial cells per 100-power ﬁeld, and a
predominance of gram-positive diplococci.
The Quellung reaction (capsular swelling; capsular
precipitation reaction) is a test which provides rapid
identiﬁcation of pneumococci in clinical specimens including
spinal ﬂuid, sputum, and exudates. The procedure involves
mixing loopfuls of bacteria in suspension, pneumococcal
antiserum, and methylene blue on the surface of a glass
slide and examine under oil immersion. If the reaction is
positive, the organism will be surrounded by a large capsule.
Counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) is a rapid and speciﬁc
diagnostic method to detect pneumococcal capsular
polysaccharide antigen in various specimens including blood,
spinal ﬂuid, urine, pleural ﬂuid, and peritoneal ﬂuid.
Sensitivity is highest in spinal ﬂuid. The latex or co-
agglutination test is similar to the CIE, but has the
advantages of being easier to perform and higher sensitivity
for detecting antigen in spinal ﬂuid. None of the rapid tests
are useful for diagnosing pneumonia using sputum, because
of poor speciﬁcity.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Pneumococcal disease occurs throughout the world.
Reservoir
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen. The
reservoir for pneumococci is presumably the nasopharynx of
asymptomatic human carriers. There are no animal or
insect vectors.


## p. xlviii (#181) #########################################

PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE
Transmission
Transmission of Streptococcus pneumoniae occurs as the
result of direct person-to-person contact via droplets, and by
“autoinoculation” in persons carrying the bacteria in their
upper respiratory tract. The pneumococcal serotypes most
often responsible for causing infection are those most
frequently found in carriers. The spread of the organism
within a family or household is inﬂuenced by such factors as;
crowding, increased seasonal risk, and the presence of upper
respiratory infections or pneumococcal disease such as
pneumonia or otitis media. The spread of pneumococcal
disease is usually associated with increased carriage rates,
however, high carriage rates do not appear to increase the
risk of disease transmission in households.
Temporal pattern
Pneumococcal infections are more common during the winter
and in early spring when respiratory diseases are more
prevalent.
Communicability
The period of communicability for pneumococcal disease is
unknown, but presumably transmission can occur as long as
the organism appears in respiratory discharges.
Secular Trends in the United States
Pneumococcal disease is not reportable in the United States.
However, estimates of its incidence have been made from a
variety of population-based studies. Over 500,000 cases of
invasive pneumococcal disease are believed to occur annually
in the United States, the majority of which are pneumonia.
Persons in all age groups may be affected. However, disease
is most commonly reported in children <2 years of age and
adults >40 years of age. Recent studies estimate that the
overall incidence of pneumococcal bacteremia (blood borne
infection) in the United States is 15-19 cases per 100,000
population. For adults 65 years of age and older, the
incidence of bacteremia increases to 50 per 100,000
population. Children 2 years of age and younger experience
the greatest risk of bacteremia, with an incidence of 160 per
100,000. The incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia may be
three to ﬁve times that of bacteremia. Pneumococcal disease
occurs more often in males than in females at all stages of
life (M:F = 3:2).

Mortality from pneumococcal disease is highest among
patients with bacteremia or meningitis, in patients with
underlying medical conditions, and in older persons. Among
some high-risk patients, up to 40% of those with bacteremic
disease die. Mortality rates from pneumococcal bacteremia
are highest among young children and in older adults. High
death rates occur despite therapy with antibiotics, and older
adults are at an increased risk, from 30%-40% in those 50 to
69 years of age and as high as 55%-60% in those 70 years or
older.
Community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia is usually a
sporadic disease in carriers who have a breakdown in their
pulmonary defense mechanisms. Secondary pneumococcal
pneumonia is the most common bacterial complication of
both inﬂuenza and measles. However, epidemics of
pneumococcal pneumonia are uncommon. When epidemics
occur, they are usually in crowded environments, such as
jails and nursing homes. During outbreaks, persons with
invasive disease often have underlying illness and may have
a high fatality rate.
Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
Pneumococcal vaccine is composed of puriﬁed preparations of
pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide. The ﬁrst
polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine was licensed in the
United States in 1977 . It contained puriﬁed capsular
polysaccharide antigen from 14 different types of
pneumococcal bacteria. In 1983, a 23-valent polysaccharide
vaccine was licensed and replaced the 14 valent vaccine,
which is no longer produced. This pneumococcal vaccine
contains polysaccharide antigen from the 23 types of
pneumococcal bacteria that cause 88% of bacteremic
pneumococcal disease. In addition, cross-reactivity occurs for
several capsular types which account for an additional 8% of
bacteremic disease.
Two vaccines are produced by US. manufacturers:
Pneumovax 23, by Merck Sharp and Dohme, and Pnu
Immune 23, by Lederle Laboratories. Both of the
manufacturers’ single vaccine dose (0.5 ml) contains 25 ug of
each antigen and include either phenol or thimerosal as a
preservative. Pneumococcal vaccine is given by injection,
and may be administered either intramuscularly or
subcutaneously.
Studies which have compared patterns of pneumococcal
carriage before and after vaccination have not shown
clinically signiﬁcant decreases in carrier rates among
vaccinees. In addition, no change in the distribution of
vaccine-type and non-vaccine-type organisms been observed
as the result of vaccination.


## p. xlviii (#183) #########################################

PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE m
Most healthy adults who receive pneumococcal vaccine
develop antibodies against the serotypes contained in the
vaccine, usually within 2 to 3 weeks after vaccination. Older
adults and persons with some chronic illnesses may not
respond as well, if at all. In children under 2 years of age,
antibody response to most serotypes is generally poor. This
creates a significant problem since 80% of childhood
pneumococcal disease occurs in this age group.
Pneumococcal vaccine efﬁcacy studies have resulted in
various estimates of clinical effectiveness. Overall, the
vaccine is 60%-70% effective in preventing invasive disease.
However, the vaccine may be less effective in preventing
pneumococcal infection in some groups, particularly those
with signiﬁcant underlying illness. Although the vaccine
may not be as effective in some persons, especially those who
do not have normal resistance to infections, it is still
recommended for such persons because they are at high risk
of developing severe disease.
indications for Vaccination
Adults
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be
administered routinely to all adults 65 years and older. The
vaccine is also indicated for adults with normal immune
systems who have chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular
disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes, alcoholism, cirrhosis,
or cerebrospinal ﬂuid leaks.
Immunocompromised adults who are at increased risk of
pneumococcal disease or its complications should also be
vaccinated. This group includes persons with splenic
dysfunction or absence (either from disease or surgical
removal), Hodgkin’s disease, lymphoma, multiple myeloma,
chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome (a type of kidney
disease), or conditions such as organ transplantation
associated with immunosuppression. Adults with
asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV infection should be
vaccinated.
Children
Children 2 years old and older with long-term illnesses that
are associated with a high risk of getting serious
pneumococcal infections or its complications should be
vaccinated. These include children whose spleens have been
surgically removed, as well as those who have sickle cell
disease, nephrotic syndrome, or CSF leaks. Children with
immunosuppression, including asymptomatic or
symptomatic HIV, should be vaccinated.

NOTE: Frequent diseases of the upper respiratory system,
including infections of the ear or sinuses, in children who are
otherwise healthy, are not reasons to use this vaccine.
Special Groups
Pneumococcal vaccine should be considered for persons living
in special environments or social settings with an identiﬁed
increased risk of pneumococcal disease or its complications,
such as certain Native American populations.
Timing of vaccination
If elective splenectomy is being considered, the vaccine
should be given at least 2 weeks before the operation.
Similarly, there should also be a two-week interval between
vaccination and initiation of cancer chemotherapy or other
immunosuppressive therapy.
Revaccination
Studies of revaccination with pneumococcal vaccine have
produced varying results. In general, available data have
not shown increased protection in the majority of
revaccinated persons. Routine revaccination of persons who
received the 14-valent vaccine is not recommended.
However, revaccination with the 23-valent vaccine should be
strongly considered for persons who received the 14-valent
vaccine if they are at highest risk of fatal pneumococcal
infection. Patients without spleens are in this category and
should be considered for revaccination. Revaccination should
also be considered for adults at highest risk who received the
23-valent vaccine 6 or more years before, and for those who
have been shown to have a rapid decline in pneumococcal
antibody levels. Patients with nephrotic syndrome, renal
failure, or transplant recipients would be in this category.
Revaccination after 3 to 5 years should also be considered for
children with nephrotic syndrome, asplenia, or sickle cell
anemia, who would be less than 11 years old at
revaccination.
Adverse Events Following Vaccination
About half of those who are given pneumococcal vaccine have
very mild side effects, such as redness and pain at the
injection site. Less than 1% of those given pneumococcal
vaccine may develop fever, muscle aches, and severe local
reactions.
Serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions have
rarely been reported-about ﬁve in every million doses given.

PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE m
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
A serious allergic reaction to a dose of pneumococcal vaccine
or a vaccine component is a contraindication to further doses
of vaccine. Such allergic reactions are rare. Persons with
moderate to severe illness should not be vaccinated until
their condition improves. However, minor illnesses, such as
upper respiratory infections, are not a contraindication to
vaccination.
The safety of pneumococcal vaccine for pregnant women has
not been studied, therefore, it should not be given to healthy
pregnant women. Women who are at high risk of
pneumococcal disease and who are candidates for
pneumococcal vaccine ideally should be vaccinated before
pregnancy.
Goals and Coverage Levels
The target groups for pneumococcal vaccine and inﬂuenza
vaccine overlap. These vaccines can be given at the same
time at different sites without increased side effects. The
Healthy People 2000 goal is to achieve 60% coverage for
pneumococcal vaccine among persons at highest risk of
pneumococcal disease. Data from the 1993 National Health
Interview Survey suggests that only 28% of persons 65 years
of age and older have ever been vaccinated. Opportunities to
vaccinate high-risk persons are missed both at the time of
hospital discharge and during visits to clinicians’ ofﬁces.
Effective programs for vaccine delivery are needed, including
offering the vaccine in hospitals at discharge, clinicians’
ofﬁces, nursing homes, and other chronic care facilities.
More than two-thirds of the persons who have been
hospitalized with serious pneumococcal disease have been
admitted to a hospital in the preceding 3 to 5 years. In
addition, persons who frequently visit physicians and who
have chronic conditions are more likely to be at high risk of
pneumococcal infection than those who require infrequent
visits. Screening and subsequent immunization of
hospitalized persons found to be at high risk could have a
signiﬁcant impact in reducing complications and death
associated with pneumococcal disease.

Chapter
Varicella
ARICELLA IS AN ACUTE CONTAGIOUS DISEASE CAUSED
v by varicella zoster virus (VZV). The recurrent infection
(herpes zoster, also known as shingles) has been recog-
nized since ancient times. Primary varicella infection
(chickenpox) was not reliably distinguished from smallpox
until the end of the 19th century. In 1875, Steiner
demonstrated that chickenpox was caused by an infectious
agent by inoculating volunteers with the vesicular ﬂuid from
a patient with acute varicella. Clinical observations of the
relationship between varicella and herpes zoster were made
in 1888 by von Bokay, when susceptible children acquired
varicella after contact with herpes zoster. VZV was isolated
from vesicular ﬂuid of both chickenpox and zoster lesions in
cell culture by Thomas Weller in 1954. Subsequent
laboratory studies of the virus led to the development of a
live attenuated varicella vaccine in Japan in the 1970s. The
vaccine was licensed for use in healthy children and adults in
the United States in March 1995.
Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV)
VZV is a DNA virus, and is a member of the herpesvirus
group. Like other herpes viruses, VZV has the capacity to
persist in the body after the primary (ﬁrst) infection as a
latent infection. VZV persists in sensory nerve ganglia.
Primary infection with VZV results in chickenpox. Herpes
zoster is the result of recurrent infection. The virus has a
short survival time outside the infected host.
Pathogenesis
VZV enters through the respiratory tract and conjunctiva.
The virus is believed to replicate at the site of entry in the
nasopharynx and in regional lymph nodes. A primary
viremia occurs 4-6 days after infection, which disseminates
the virus to other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and

\ concentrated on trunk
followed by a secondary viremia, with viral infection of the
skin. Virus can be cultured from mononuclear cells of an
infected person from 5 days before to 1 or 2 days following
the appearance of the rash.
Clinical Features
Incubation period
The average incubation period for varicella is 14 to 16 days
from exposure, with a range of 10 to 21 days. This may be
prolonged in immunocompromised patients and those who
have received varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG). The
incubation period may be up to 28 days after VZIG.
Prodrome
Adults may have 1 to 2 days of fever and malaise prior to
rash onset. In children, the rash is often the ﬁrst sign of
disease.
Rash
The rash is generalized, pruritic, and rapidly progresses
from macules to papules to vesicular lesions before crusting.
The rash usually appears ﬁrst on the scalp, moves to the
trunk, and then the extremities, with the highest
concentration of lesions on the trunk. Lesions also can occur
on mucous membranes of the oropharynx, respiratory tract,
vagina, conjunctiva, and the cornea. Lesions are usually 1
to 4 mm in diameter. The vesicles contain clear ﬂuid on an
erythematous base that may rupture or become purulent
before they dry and crust. Successive crops appear over
several days, with lesions present in several stages of
evolution. For example, macular lesions may be observed in
the same area of skin as mature vesicles. Healthy children
usually have 200-500 lesions in 2 to 4 successive crops.
The clinical course in normal children is generally mild,
with malaise, pruritus (itching), and fever up to 102°F for 2
to 3 days. Adults may have more severe disease and have a
higher incidence of complications. Respiratory and
gastrointestinal symptoms are absent. Children with
lymphoma and leukemia may develop a severe progressive
form of varicella characterized by high fever, extensive
vesicular eruption, and high complication rates. Children
infected with human immunodeﬁciency virus may also have
severe, prolonged illness.


## p. xlviii (#189) #########################################

VARICELLA
Recovery from primary varicella infection results in lifetime
immunity. In otherwise healthy persons, clinical illness
after reexposure is rare, but may occur in
immunocompromised persons. As with other viral diseases,
reexposure to natural (wild) varicella may lead to reinfection
that boosts antibody titers without causing clinical illness or
detectable viremia.
Herpes Zoster
Herpes zoster, or shingles, occurs when latent VZV
reactivates and causes recurrent disease. The immunologic
mechanism that controls latency of VZV is not well
understood. However, factors associated with recurrent
disease include aging, immunosuppression, intrauterine
exposure to VZV, and varicella at a young age (<18 months).
In immunocompromised persons, zoster may disseminate,
causing generalized skin lesions, and central nervous
system, pulmonary, and hepatic involvement.
The vesicular eruption of zoster generally occurs unilaterally
in the distribution of a dermatome supplied by a dorsal root
or extramedullary cranial nerve sensory ganglion. Most
often, this involves the trunk or the area of the ﬁfth cranial
nerve. Two to four days prior to the eruption there may be
pain and paresthesia in the segment involved. There are few
systemic symptoms. Post-herpetic neuralgia, or pain in the
area of the recurrence which persists after the lesions have
resolved, is a distressing complication of zoster, with no
adequate therapy currently available. Post-herpetic
neuralgia may last as long as a year after the episode of
zoster. Ocular nerve and other organ involvement with
zoster can occur, often with severe sequelae.
Complications
Acute varicella is generally mild and self-limited, but may be
associated with complications. The most common
complications of varicella include secondary bacterial
infections of skin lesions, dehydration, pneumonia, and
central nervous system involvement. Secondary bacterial
infections of skin lesions with staphylococcus or
streptococcus are the most common cause of hospitalization
and outpatient medical visits. Secondary infection with
invasive group A streptococci may cause serious illness and
lead to hospitalization or death. Pneumonia following
varicella is usually viral, but may be bacterial.‘ Secondary
bacterial pneumonia is more common in children <1 year of
age. Up to 30% of pneumonia cases among healthy adults
are fatal.

Central nervous system manifestations of varicella range
from aseptic meningitis to encephalitis. Involvement of the
cerebellum, with resulting cerebellar ataxia, is the most
common and generally has a good outcome. Encephalitis is
an infrequent complication of varicella (estimated 1.8 per
10,000 cases), and may lead to seizures and coma. Diffuse
cerebral involvement is more common in adults than in
children.
Reye syndrome is an unusual complication of varicella and
inﬂuenza and occurs almost exclusively in children who take
aspirin during the acute illness. The etiology of Reye
syndrome is unknown. There has been a dramatic decrease
in the incidence of Reye syndrome during the past decade,
presumably related to decreased use of aspirin in children.
Rare complications of varicella include aseptic meningitis,
transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome,
thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic varicella, purpura
fulminans, glomerulonephritis, myocarditis, arthritis,
orchitis, uveitis, iritis, and clinical hepatitis.
Approximately 10,000 persons with varicella require
hospitalization each year. Hospitalization rates are
approximately 2-3 per 1,000 cases among healthy children
and 8 per 1,000 cases among adults. Death occurs in
approximately 1 in 60,000 cases. From 50 to 100 deaths
from varicella are reported annually, most of which occur in
immunologically normal children and adults.
The risk of complications varies with age. Complications are
infrequent among healthy children, and are much higher in
persons 215 years of age , and infants <1 year of age. For
instance, among children 1-14 years of age, the fatality rate
of varicella is approximately 1 per 100,000 cases. Among
persons 15-19 years, the fatality rate is 2.7 per 100,000
cases, and among adults 30-49 years of age, 25.2 per 100,000
cases. Adults account for only 5% of reported cases of
varicella, but account for approximately 35% of mortality.
Immunocompromised persons have a high risk of serious
varicella infection and a high risk of disseminated disease
(up to 36% in one report). These persons may have multiple
organ system involvement, and the disease may become
fulminant and hemorrhagic. The most frequent
complications in immunocompromised persons are
pneumonia and encephalitis.


## p. xlviii (#191) #########################################

VARICELLA @
Perinatal infection
The onset of maternal varicella from 5 days before to 2 days
after delivery may result in overwhelming infection of the
neonate and a fatality rate as high as 30%. This severe
disease results from fetal exposure to varicella virus without
the beneﬁt of passive maternal antibody. Infants born to
mothers with onset of maternal varicella 5 days or more
prior to delivery usually have a benign course, presumably
due to passive transfer of maternal antibody across the
placenta.
Congenital VZ V infection
Primary varicella infection in the ﬁrst 20 weeks of gestation
is occasionally associated with a variety of abnormalities in
the newborn, including low birth weight, hypoplasia of an
extremity, cicatricial skin scarring, localized muscular
atrophy, encephalitis, cortical atrophy, chorioretinitis, and
microcephaly. These abnormalities, collectively known as
congenital varicella syndrome, was ﬁrst recognized in 1947.
The risk of congenital abnormalities from primary maternal
varicella infection during the ﬁrst trimester is felt to be very
low (<2%). Rare reports of congenital birth defects following
maternal zoster exist, but virologic conﬁrmation of maternal
lesions is lacking. Intrauterine Infection with VZV,
particularly after 20 weeks gestation, is associated with
zoster in those infants at an earlier age; the exact risk is
unknown.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis is not routinely required, but is useful
if conﬁrmation of the diagnosis or determination of
susceptibility is necessary.
Viral isolation
While rarely necessary for diagnosis, varicella zoster virus
may be isolated in tissue culture. The most frequent source
of isolation is vesicular ﬂuid. The virus is difﬁcult to isolate
from respiratory secretions.
Stained smears from vesicular scrapings (Tzanck smear)
may reveal multinucleated giant cells, consistent with VZV
and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. In some
instances, stains of vesicular scrapings may be tested using a
ﬂuorescent monoclonal antibody test which is very sensitive
and speciﬁc.

Serologic testing
A reliable history of chickenpox has been found to be a valid
measure of immunity to varicella because the rash is
distinctive, and subclinical cases are unusual. As a result,
serologic testing of children is generally not necessary.
However, serologic testing may be useful in adult
vaccination programs.
A variety of serologic tests for varicella antibody are
available. Available tests include compliment ﬁxation (CF),
indirect ﬂuorescent antibody (IFA), ﬂuorescent antibody to
membrane antigen (FAMA), neutralization, indirect
hemagglutination (IHA), immune adherence
hemagglutination (IAHA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), latex
agglutination (LA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). IFA, IAHA, FAMA, neutralization, and RIA
are sensitive tests, but are time consuming and have
requirements that make them unsuitable for general
diagnostic laboratories. Compliment ﬁxation (CF) tests have
been widely used but are the least sensitive test. Enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is sensitive and
speciﬁc, simple to perform, and is widely commercially
available. A commercially available latex agglutination (LA)
is sensitive, and simple and rapid to perform. LA is
generally more sensitive than commercial ELISA tests.
Either of these tests would be useful for screening for
varicella immunity.
For the diagnosis of acute varicella infection, serologic
conﬁrmation would include a signiﬁcant rise in varicella IgG
by any standard serologic assay, or a single positive serologic
test for varicella IgM antibody.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Varicella and herpes zoster occur worldwide. There are data
which suggest that varicella infection is less common in
childhood in tropical areas, and chickenpox occurs more
commonly among adults. The reason(s) for this difference in
age distribution is not known with certainty.
Reservoir
Varicella is a human disease. N 0 animal or insect source or
vector is known to exist.


## p. xlviii (#193) #########################################

VARICELLA M
Transmission
Infection with VZV occurs through the respiratory tract. The
most common mode of transmission of VZV is believed to be
person-to-person from infected respiratory tract secretions.
Transmission may also occur by respiratory contact with
airborne droplets, or by direct contact or inhalation of
aerosols from vesicular ﬂuid of skin lesions of acute varicella
or zoster.
Temporal pattern
In temperate areas, varicella has a distinct seasonal
ﬂuctuation, with the highest incidence occurring in winter
and early spring. In the United States, incidence is highest
between March and May, and lowest between September and
November. Less seasonality is reported in tropical areas.
Herpes zoster has no seasonal variation and occurs
throughout the year.
Communicability
The period of communicability extends from 1 to 2 days
before the onset of rash through the ﬁrst 4 to 5 days, or until
lesions have formed crusts. Immunocompromised patients
with progressive varicella are probably contagious during the
entire period new lesions are appearing. The virus has not
been isolated from crusted lesions.
Varicella is highly contagious. It is less contagious than
measles, but more so than mumps and rubella. Secondary
attack rates among susceptible household contacts of persons
with varicella are as high as 90% (that is, 9 out of 10
susceptible household contacts of persons with varicella will
become infected).
Secular Trends in the United States
Varicella in endemic in the United States and virtually all
persons acquire varicella by adulthood. As a result, the
number of cases occurring annually should approximate the
birth cohort, or approximately 4 million. Between 150,000
to 200,000 cases of varicella are reported annually to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, representing
4%-6% of all cases. As of December 1994, varicella was
notiﬁable in 25 states.

The majority of cases, approximately 90%, occur in children
less than 15 years of age. The highest age-speciﬁc attack
rates are in children 5 to 9 years of age (44% of cases) and 1-
4 years of age (33% of cases). By adulthood, more than 90%
of adults have antibodies to varicella.
Herpes Zoster
Herpes zoster is not a notiﬁable condition. An estimated
300,000 episodes of zoster of occur annually. Ninety ﬁve
percent of these episodes are ﬁrst occurrences, and 5% are
recurrences. The risk of zoster increases with increasing
age. By age 80, almost 50% of persons will have experienced
at least one episode of zoster.
Varicella Vaccine
Characteristics
Varicella zoster vaccine is a live attenuated viral vaccine,
derived from the Oka strain of VZV. The vaccine virus was
isolated by Takahashi in the early 1970s from vesicular ﬂuid
from a healthy child with varicella disease. The virus was
attenuated by sequential passage in human embryonic lung
cell culture, embryonic guinea pig ﬁbroblasts, and in WI-38
human diploid cells. The Oka-Merck vaccine has undergone
further passage through MRC-5 human diploid cell cultures
for a total of 31 passages. Varicella vaccine does not contain
egg or ovalbumin.
Varicella vaccine was licensed for general use in Japan and
Korea in 1988. It was licensed in the United States in
March 1995.
immunogenicity and Efficacy
More than 9,000 healthy children 12 months to 12 years of
age have been vaccinated with varicella vaccine in clinical
trials in the United States since 1981. After one dose of
vaccine, 97 % of children developed detectable antibody
titers. Over 90% of vaccine responders maintain antibody
for at least 6 years. In Japanese studies, 97% of children
had antibody from 7 to 10 years after vaccination. Clinical
efﬁcacy is estimated to be 95% after 7 years.
More than 1,600 healthy adolescents and adults have been
vaccinated in clinical trials. An average of 78% developed
antibody after one dose and 99% developed antibody after a
second dose given 4 to 8 weeks later. Antibody has persisted
for at least 1 year in 97% of vaccinees after the second dose
given 4 to 8 weeks after the ﬁrst dose. Studies on the

persistence of antibody and clinical efﬁcacy in both children
and adults are ongoing.
During 9 years of clinical trials in persons of all ages, <1% to
3% per year have developed breakthrough infections (i.e.,
developed varicella disease even though they had responded
to the vaccine). All breakthrough infections have been mild,
with fewer lesions (generally less than 50), many of which
are maculopapular rather than vesicular. Most persons with
breakthrough infection do not have fever. There have been
no complications. Illness associated with breakthrough
infection have not increased in severity during the 7-10 years
of follow-up study after vaccination.
Routine Schedule
AT THE TIME THIS TEXT WENT TO PRESS
(DECEMBER 1995) THE ACIP HAD NOT YET ISSUED
RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE OF VARICELLA
VACCINE. ACIP RECOMMENDATIONS ARE EXPECTED
TO BE PUBLISHED IN EARLY 1996.


Children
Varicella virus vaccine is expected to be recommended for all
children without contraindications at 12-18 months of age.
The vaccine may be given to all children at this age
regardless of prior history of varicella. However,
immunization is not necessary in children with reliable
histories of chickenpox. Varicella vaccine should be
administered subcutaneously. It has been shown to be safe
and effective in healthy children when administered at the
same time as measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine at
separate sites and with separate syringes. If varicella and
MMR vaccines are not administered at the same visit, they
should be separated by at least 30 days. Varicella vaccine
may also be administered simultaneously (but at separate
sites with separate syringes) as all other childhood vaccines
(DTP-DTaP, Haemophilus influenzae type b, hepatitis B).
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
strongly recommends that varicella vaccine be administered
simultaneously with all other vaccines recommended at 12 to
18 months of age.
Varicella vaccine is also recommended for immunization of
all susceptible children by the 13th birthday. Children who
have not been immunized previously and who do not have a
reliable history of chickenpox are considered susceptible.
Efforts should be made to assure varicella immunity by this
age, because after 13 years of age varicella disease is more
severe, complications are more frequent, and two doses of
vaccine are required.

K. Serologic testing may be cost effective
Adolescents and Adults
Varicella vaccine is approved for healthy adolescents and
adults. Approximately 80% of adolescents and adults
respond to a single dose of varicella vaccine. In contrast, at
least 97% of healthy children will develop detectable
antibody after a single dose. As a result, persons 13 years of
age and older should receive two doses of varicella vaccine
separated by 4 to 8 weeks. If there is a lapse of more than 8
weeks after the ﬁrst dose, the second dose may be
administered without repeating the ﬁrst dose.
Varicella Immunity
Children with a reliable history of chickenpox can be
assumed to be immune to varicella. A parental history is
acceptable, and physician documentation is not necessary.
Children without a reliable history, or with an uncertain
history of chickenpox should be considered susceptible.
Serologic testing of such children prior to vaccination is not
warranted, because the majority of children between
12 months and 12 years of age without a clinical history of
chickenpox are susceptible. Prior history of chickenpox is
not a contraindication to varicella vaccination.
Adolescents and adults with reliable parental or personal
histories of chickenpox can be assumed to be immune. Those
without a reliable history can be considered to be
susceptible, or may be tested to determine varicella
immunity. Epidemiologic and serologic studies indicate that
over 90% of adults are immune to varicella. In addition, 71%
to 93% of adults without a reliable history of chickenpox are
actually immune. As a result, serologic testing prior to
vaccination is likely to be cost effective for adults as well as
adolescents. As with children, a prior history of chickenpox
is not a contraindication to varicella vaccination.
Prioritization of Groups for_ _
Varicella Immunity or Vaccination
Varicella vaccine should be administered routinely to all
children 12 to 18 months of age, and to all susceptible older
children by 13 years of age.
Assessment of varicella immunity of all adolescents and
adults, and vaccination of those who are susceptible, is
desirable to protect these individuals from the higher risk of
complications from acquired varicella. Vaccination may be
offered at the time of routine health care visits. However,
speciﬁc assessment efforts should be focused on adolescents
and adults who are most likely to transmit varicella to
others, and those at highest risk of exposure.



## p. xlviii (#197) #########################################

VARICELLA @
Varicella vaccination is recommended for susceptible
adolescents and adults who will have close contact with
persons at high risk for serious complications of acquired
varicella. This group would include health care workers, and
susceptible family contacts of immunocompromised
individuals.
Varicella vaccination should be considered for susceptible
persons who are high risk of exposure to varicella. This
group includes persons who live or work in environments in
which there is a high likelihood of transmission of varicella,
such as teachers of young children, day care workers, and
residents and staff in institutional settings; persons who live
or work in environments in which varicella transmission
may occur (e.g., college students, inmates and staff of
correctional institutions, and military personnel);
nonpregnant women of childbearing age, in order to reduce
the risk of VZV transmission to the fetus if the susceptible
woman should develop varicella during pregnancy; and
international travelers.
Health Care Workers
ACIP is expected to recommend that all health care workers
be immune to varicella, either from a reliable history of
varicella disease or vaccination. In health care settings,
serologic screening of personnel who are uncertain of their
varicella history, or who claim not to have had the disease, is
likely to be cost effective. Testing for varicella immunity
following two doses of vaccine is not considered necessary
because 99% of persons are seropositive after the second
dose.
One potential problem is that Seroconversion does not always
result in full protection against disease (see section on
Immunogenicity and Efﬁcacy for information on
breakthrough infection). If a vaccinated health care worker
is exposed to varicella, the exposed person should be tested
for varicella antibody as soon as possible following the
exposure. Persons with detectable antibody are unlikely to
develop varicella. Persons without antibody can be retested
5-6 days later to determine if an anamnestic response is
present (i.e., antibody appears quickly after exposure). If
antibody is present less than 7 days after exposure it is
unlikely that the exposed person will develop disease.
Persons who remain susceptible (i.e., antibody negative)
7 days following exposure should be furloughed, or monitored
very closely and furloughed at the onset of symptoms
suggestive of varicella.

- Usually <50 lesions


KSystemic reactions and fever rare

The risk of transmission of vaccine virus from a vaccinated
person to a susceptible contact appears to be very low, and
the beneﬁts of vaccinating susceptible health care workers
clearly outweigh this potential risk. Transmission of
vaccine virus appears to occur primarily if and when the
vaccinee develops a vaccine-associated rash. As a safeguard,
institutions may wish to consider precautions for personnel
who develop a rash following vaccination (e.g., avoidance of
contact with persons at high risk of serious complications,
such as immunosuppressed persons).
Post-exposure Prophylaxis
There are no data on post-exposure efﬁcacy of the current
varicella vaccine. Post-exposure prophylaxis of children with
earlier formulations of vaccine suggests that the vaccine may
prevent infection in up to 90% of children when the vaccine
was given within 3 days of exposure. However, until
additional data are available, vaccine should not be relied
upon to prevent varicella if administered after exposure has
occurred. Vaccination should be considered for unvaccinated
susceptible health care workers who are exposed to varicella
disease. However, because the protective effects of
postexposure vaccination are unknown, persons vaccinated
following an exposure should be managed as if they were
susceptible.
Adverse Events Following Vaccination
The most common adverse events following varicella vaccine
are injection site complaints such as pain, soreness, redness,
and swelling. Based on information from the manufacturer’s
clinical trials of varicella vaccine, local reactions are reported
by 19% of children, and by 24% of adolescents and adults
(33% following the second dose). These local adverse events
are generally mild and self-limited. A varicella-like rash at
injection site is reported by 3% of children , and by 1% of
adolescents and adults following the second dose. In both
circumstances, there has been a median of two lesions.
These lesions generally occur within 2 weeks, and are most
commonly maculopapular rather than vesicular.
A generalized varicella-like rash is reported by 4% to 6% of
recipients of varicella vaccine (1% after the second dose in
adolescents and adults), with a median of ﬁve lesions. Most
of these generalized rashes occur within 3 weeks and most
are maculopapular.
Fever within 42 days of vaccination is reported by 15% of
children and 10% of adolescents and adults. The majority of
these episodes of fever have been attributed to intercurrent
illness rather than to the vaccine.


## p. xlviii (#199) #########################################

VARICELLA
Zoster following vaccination
Varicella vaccine is a live virus vaccine, and results in a
latent infection, similar to that caused by wild varicella
virus. Consequently, zoster caused by the vaccine virus has
been reported. Among children, the rate of zoster following
varicella vaccine is estimated to be 18 cases per 100,000
person-years of observation. This rate is 4-5 times less than
estimated 77 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation
for persons infected with wild varicella virus. One case of
zoster in a vaccinated adult has been reported. However, the
virus isolated from zoster lesions was similar to wild
varicella virus, suggesting that the zoster was due to
antecedent wild virus infection. All cases of zoster following
vaccine have been mild and have not been associated with
complications, including post-herpetic neuralgia.
Contraindications and Precautions
Contraindications and precautions to varicella vaccine are
similar to those for other live attenuated vaccines. Persons
with a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine component or
following a prior dose of vaccine should not receive varicella
vaccine. Varicella vaccine contains minute amounts of
neomycin and gelatin, but does not contain egg protein or
preservatives.
Vaccination of persons with moderate or severe illnesses
should be postponed until the condition has improved. This
precaution is intended to prevent complicating the
management of an ill patient with a potential vaccine
adverse event, such as fever. Minor illness, such as otitis
media and upper respiratory infections, concurrent antibiotic
therapy, and exposure or recovery from other illnesses are
not contraindications to varicella vaccine. Although there is
no evidence that either varicella or varicella vaccine
exacerbates tuberculosis, vaccination is not recommended for
persons known to have untreated active tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis skin testing is not a prerequisite for varicella
vaccination.
Persons with immunosuppression due to leukemia,
lymphoma, generalized malignancy, immune deﬁciency
disease, or immunosuppressive therapy should not be
vaccinated. However, treatment with low dose (<2 mg-kg/
day), alternate day, topical, replacement, or aerosolized
steroid preparations is not a contraindication to varicella
vaccination. Persons whose immunosuppressive therapy
with steroids or chemotherapeutic agents has been stopped
for 3 months may be vaccinated. Varicella vaccine is
available from the manufacturer under a research protocol

for special use in certain patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia in remission. Please consult the ACIP statement
or contact the manufacturer for further information.
Few data exist on the use of varicella vaccine in persons with
asymptomatic or symptomatic infection with human
immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV). At this time, varicella
vaccine is not recommended for persons known to be infected
with HIV, regardless of the degree of immunosuppression.
However, routine testing for HIV infection of asymptomatic
children who come for vaccination is not recommended. If
inadvertent vaccination of a HIV-infected person results in
clinical illness, the use of acyclovir may modify the severity
of the disease.
The effects of varicella vaccine on a developing fetus are
unknown. Since infection with wild varicella virus poses
only a small risk to the fetus, and the vaccine virus is
attenuated, the risk to the fetus, if any, should be even
lower. However, because deﬁnitive data are lacking, women
known to be pregnant should not be vaccinated. Although the
manufacturer’s package insert states otherwise, ACIP and
the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that
pregnancy be avoided for 1 month following receipt of
varicella vaccine.
The manufacturer, in collaboration with the Centers for
Disease Control has established a Varicella Vaccination in
Pregnancy registry to monitor the maternal-fetal outcomes of
pregnant women inadvertently given varicella vaccine. The
telephone number for the Registry is 1-800-986-8999.
The effect of the administration of antibody-containing blood
products (e.g., immune globulin, whole blood or packed red
blood cells, intravenous immune globulin, varicella zoster
immune globulin [VZIG]) on the response to varicella vaccine
virus is unknown. Because of the potential inhibition of the
response to varicella vaccination by passively transferred
antibodies, varicella vaccine should not be given for at least
5 months after antibody-containing blood products. Immune
globulin or VZIG should not be given for 3 weeks following
vaccination unless the beneﬁts exceed those of the vaccine.
In such cases, the vaccinee should either be revaccinated
5 months later or tested for immunity 6 months later and
revaccinated if seronegative.
No adverse events following varicella vaccination related to
the use of salicylates (e.g., aspirin) have been reported to
date. However, the manufacturer recommends that vaccine
recipients should avoid the use of salicylates for 6 weeks
after receiving varicella vaccine because of the association
between aspirin use and Reye Syndrome following
chickenpox.


## p. xlviii (#201) #########################################

VAR/cm @
Transmission of varicella vaccine virus
Available data suggest that healthy children have limited
potential to transmit vaccine virus to susceptible contacts.
The risk of transmission may be higher in persons who
develop a rash following vaccination. Among household
contacts of vaccinated children, less than 1% of susceptible
household contacts seroconverted. No secondary clinical
illnesses have been reported.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Varicella vaccine is very fragile and must be handled with
extreme care. To maintain potency, the lyophilized vaccine
must be stored frozen at an average temperature of +5 F (-15
C). Household freezers, including frost-free models,
manufactured within the last 5-10 years, are designed to
maintain temperatures as low as -4F (-20C), and are
acceptable for storage of the vaccine. Refrigerators with ice
compartments which are not tightly enclosed or are enclosed
with unsealed, uninsulated doors (i.e., small dormitory-style
refrigerator-freezer combinations) will generally not be
capable of maintaining the required storage temperature.
Regardless of the type of freezer, providers should check the
adequacy of their freezer storage before obtaining vaccine
by monitoring and verifying the temperature of their
freezer.
The vaccine diluent should be stored separately at room
temperature or in the refrigerator. The vaccine should be
reconstituted according to the directions in the package
insert and only with the diluent supplied, which does not
contain preservative or other anti-viral substances which
might inactivate the vaccine virus. Once reconstituted, the
vaccine must be used immediately to minimize loss of
potency. The vaccine must be discarded if not used within
30 minutes of reconstitution.
If varicella vaccine is inadvertently placed in the
refrigerator, or if lyophilized vaccine is left at room
temperature for a short time, it may still be potent enough
to use. Mishandled vaccine should be clearly marked and
replaced in the freezer separate from properly handled
vaccine. After storing the vaccine, the manufacturer must
be contacted for recommendations before any of the
mishandled vaccine is used. The Merck Vaccine Division
varicella information telephone number is 1-800-9VARIVAX
(1-800-982-7482). If the vaccine has been kept cold, or has
been exposed to room temperature for a very short time, the
manufacturer may recommend that the expiration date be
shortened, and that the vaccine be used as quickly as
possible. Mishandled vaccine should never be destroyed
until the manufacturer has been consulted.

Because of the lability of varicella vaccine, transport of the
vaccine from a central clinic or storage area to an off-site
clinic will be very difﬁcult. Until more information on the
stability of the vaccine at higher-than-recommended
temperatures is available, such off-site transport is
discouraged. If off-site transport is attempted, a high-quality
container should be used, the vaccine should be transported
on dry ice, and the temperature should be monitored
continuously, to assure that the appropriate storage
temperature is maintained.
Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG)
VZIG is a human blood product that contains high titers of
varicella zoster virus antibody. It was licensed in 1981, and
is available throughout the country from the American Red
Cross. If administered within 96 hours of exposure, VZIG
can modify or prevent clinical varicella and prevent
complications or death, especially in susceptible
immunocompromised individuals.
The decision to administer VZIG should be based on whether
the patient is susceptible either by having a negative history
of chickenpox or by lacking documentation of vaccination,
whether the exposure is likely to result in infection and,
most importantly, whether the patient is at greater risk of
complications than the general population. VZIG is
expensive ($400-$500 for the maximum dose in an adult) and
provides only temporary protection.
VZIG is indicated for use in susceptible individuals at high
risk for complications who have had a signiﬁcant exposure
(continuous household contact; playmate contact of over an
hour; hospital contact in the same 2- to 4-bed room; or
prolonged direct contact) to a person with varicella. It is
most commonly used for post-exposure prophylaxis of
immunocompromised children (immune deﬁciencies,
neoplastic disease, or on immunosuppressive therapy), and
newborns of mothers with varicella onset 5 days before to
48 hours days after delivery. It is also recommended for
premature infants with postnatal exposure, including those
born at less than 28 weeks gestation or less than 1,000 gram
birth weight (who may not have received adequate maternal
antibody regardless of whether the mother is immune), or
premature infants whose mother is not immune to varicella.
Healthy and immunocompromised adults and pregnant
women are at increased risk of complication of varicella.
VZIG should be considered if such individuals are considered
to be susceptible. There is no evidence that VZIG will
prevent congenital varicella if given as post-exposure
prophylaxis to a pregnant woman.


## p. xlviii (#203) #########################################

VARICELLA
201
VZIG is supplied in vials containing 125 units in
approximately 1.25 ml. The recommended dose considered
likely to prevent or modify varicella is 125 units per 10
kilograms of body weight, up to a maximum of 625 units, or
ﬁve vials. Higher doses can be considered for
immunosuppressed persons. VZIG is given intramuscularly,
and must never be given intravenously. It should be given
within 96 hours of exposure, preferably as soon as possible.
The administration of VZIG may prolong the incubation
period of varicella to 28 days or longer post-exposure.
More detailed information on the evaluation of a person
exposed to varicella and the use of VZIG may be found in the
varicella ACIP statement.
Special Varicella Exposure Situations
Hospital personnel
Susceptible workers with signiﬁcant exposure to varicella
should be relieved from direct patient contact from day 10 to
day 21 after exposure. If workers develop chickenpox,
varicella lesions must be crusted before they return to direct
patient contact. Receipt of VZIG does not change this
recommendation for reassignment. Since VZIG can prolong
the incubation period, the period of removal from direct
patient contact should be lengthened by 1 week or more.
Newborn with maternal rash onset
5 days before to 48 hours after delivery
Since about 50% of infants who receive VZIG will develop
varicella, if these infants remain hospitalized beyond age
10 days, they should be kept in strict isolation for the entire
incubation period (until day 28 or longer).
Acyclovir
Acyclovir is a synthetic nucleoside analog which inhibits
replication of human herpes viruses, including VZV.
Intravenous acyclovir has been available since the early
1980s for use in immunocompromised patients with
varicella. Oral acyclovir was approved in 1992 for the
treatment of chickenpox in otherwise healthy children.
Clinical studies indicate that acyclovir may be beneﬁcial if
given within 24 hours of onset of rash, including reductions
in the number of days in which new lesions appeared, in the
duration of fever, and in the severity of cutaneous and '
systemic signs and symptoms. Acyclovir has not been shown
to decrease transmission of varicella, reduce the duration of
absence from school, or reduce complications.

ACIP has made recommendations regarding the use of
acyclovir. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does
not consider acyclovir in healthy children of sufficient beneﬁt
to justify routine administration to normal children.
Because complicated varicella and more severe disease may
occur in adolescents and adults or secondary cases in the
household, AAP considered these appropriate situations for
use of the drug. Acyclovir may also be considered for
children over 12 months of age with a chronic cutaneous or
pulmonary disorder, or on salicylate therapy, and for
children receiving short, intermittent or aerosolized courses
of corticosteroids. If the child is immunocompromised,
intravenous administration is indicated. Corticosteroids
should be discontinued, if possible, after exposure.

Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive 0.5 mL hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hrs of birth,
and either 5 pg of Merck vaccine (Recombivax H8) or 10 pg of SB vaccine (Engerix-B) at a separate site. The 2nd dose is
recommended at 1-2 mos of age and the 3rd dose at 6 mos of age.
infants born to mothers whose HBsAg status is unknown should receive either 5 pg of Merck vaccine (Recombivax H8) or
10 pg of SB vaccine (Engerix-B) within 12 hrs of birth. The 2nd dose of vaccine is recommended at 1 mo of age and the 3rd
dose at 6 mos of age.
Adolescents who have not previously received 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine should initiate or complete the series at the
11-12 year-old visit. The 2nd dose should be administered at least 1 mo after the 1st dose, and the 3rd dose should be
administered at least 4 mos after the 1st dose and at least 2 mos after the 2nd dose.
DTP4 may be administered at 12 mos of age, if at least 6 mos have elapsed since DTP3. DTaP (diphtheria and tetanus
toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine) is licensed for the 4th andlor 5th vaccine dose(s) for children aged 315 mos and
may be preferred for these doses in this age group. Td (tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, adsorbed, for adult use) is
recommended at 11-12 years of age if at least 5 years have elapsed since the last dose of DTP, DTaP, or DT.
Three H. influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines are licensed for infant use. If PRP-OMP (PedvaxHlB [Merck]) is
administered at 2 and 4 mos of age, a dose at 6 mos is not required. After completing the primary series, any Hib conjugate
vaccine may be used as a booster.
Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is recommended for routine infant vaccination. Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is
recommended for persons with a congenital or acquired immune deficiency disease or an altered immune status as a result
of disease or immunosuppressive therapy, as well as their household contacts, and is an acceptable alternative for other
persons. The primary 3-dose series for IPV should be given with a minimum interval of4 wks between the 1st and 2nd
doses and 6 mos between the 2nd and 3rd doses.
The 2nd dose of MMR is routinely recommended at 4-6 yrs of age or at 11-12 yrs of age, but may be administered at any
visit, provided at least 1 mo has elapsed since receipt of the 1st dose.
Varicella zoster virus vaccine (Var) can be administered to susceptible children any time after 12 months of age.
Unvaccinated children who lack a reliable history of chickenpox should be vaccinated at the 11-12 year-old visit.

*This table is not intended for determining the correct indications and dosage for the use of immune globulin preparations. Unvaccinated persons may not
be fully protected against measles during the entire suggested interval and additional doses of immune globulin and-or measles vaccine may be indicated
following measles exposure. The concentration of measles antibody in a particular immune globulin preparation can vary by lot. The rate of antibody
clearance following receipt of an immune globulin preparation can also vary. The recommended intervals are extrapolated from an estimated half-life of 30
days for passively acquired antibody and an observed interference with the immune response to measles vaccine for 5 months following a dose of 80 mg

DEFINITIONS
lmmunobiologic: lmmunobiologics include antigenic substances, such as vaccines
and toxoids, or antibody-containing preparations, such as globulins and antitoxins,
from human or animal donors. These products are used for active or passive immuni-
zation or therapy. The following are examples of immunobiologics:
a) Vaccine: A suspension of live (usually attenuated) or inactivated microorganisms
(e.g., bacteria, viruses, or rickettsiae) or fractions thereof administered to induce im-
munity and prevent infectious disease or its sequelae. Some vaccines contain highly
defined antigens (e.g., the polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b or the
surface antigen of hepatitis B); others have antigens that are complex or incompletely
defined (e.g., killed Bordetella pertussis or live attenuated viruses). For a list of li-
censed vaccines, see Table 1.
b) Toxoid: A modified bacterial toxin that has been made nontoxic, but retains the
ability to stimulate the formation of antitoxin. For a list of licensed toxoids, see Table 1.
c) Immune globulin (IG): A sterile solution containing antibodies from human
blood. It is obtained by cold ethanol fractionation of large pools of blood plasma and
contains 15%-18% protein. Intended for intramuscular administration, (G is primarily
indicated for routine maintenance of immunity of certain immunodeficient persons
and for passive immunization against measles and hepatitis A. lG does not transmit
hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or other infectious diseases.
For a list of immune globulins, see Table 2.
d) Intravenous immune globulin (IGIV): A product derived from blood plasma from
a donor pool similar to the IG pool, but prepared so it is suitable for intravenous use.
lGlV does not transmit infectious diseases. It is primarily used for replacement therapy
in primary antibody-deficiency disorders, for the treatment of Kawasaki disease, im-
mune thrombocytopenic purpura, hypogammaglobulinemia in chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, and some cases of HIV infection. For a list of intravenous immune globulins,
see Table 2.
e) Specific immune globulin: Special preparations obtained from blood plasma
from donor pools preselected for a high antibody content against a specific antigen
(e.g., hepatitis B immune globulin, varicella-zoster immune globulin, rabies immune
globulin, tetanus immune globulin, vaccinia immune globulin, and cytomegalovirus
immune globulin). Like IG and lGlV, these preparations do not transmit infectious dis-
eases. For a list of specific immune globulins, see Table 2.
f) Antitoxin: A solution of antibodies (e.g., diphtheria antitoxin and botulinum anti-
toxin) derived from the serum of animals immunized with specific antigens. Antitoxins
are used to confer passive immunity and for treatment. For a list of antitoxins, see
Table 2.
Vaccination and Immunization
Vaccination and vaccine derive from vaccinia, the virus once used as smallpox
vaccine. Thus, vaccination originally meant inoculation with vaccinia virus to make a
person immune to smallpox. Vaccination currently denotes the physical act of admin-
istering any vaccine or toxoid.
Immunization is a more inclusive term denoting the process of inducing or provid-
ing immunity artificially by administering an immunobiologic. Immunization can be
active or passive.


## p. vi (#224) #############################################

vi MMWR January 28, 1994
Active immunization is the production of antibody or other immune responses
through the administration of a vaccine or toxoid. Passive immunization means the
provision of temporary immunity by the administration of preformed antibodies.
Three types of lmmunobiologics are administered for passive immunization:
a) pooled human lG or IGIV, b) specific immune globulin preparations, and c) antitox-
ins.
Although persons often use vaccination and immunization interchangeably in ref-
erence to active immunization, the terms are not synonomous because the
administration of an immunobiologic cannot be automatically equated with the devel-
opment of adequate immunity.

General Recommendations on Immunization
Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on
_ Immunization Practices (ACIP)
Summary
This revision of the General Recommendations on Immunization updates the
1989 statement ( 1). Changes in the immunization schedule for infants and chil-
dren include recommendations that the third dose of oral polio vaccine be
administered routinely at 6 months of age rather than at age 15 months and that
measles-mumps-rubella vaccine be administered routinely to all children at 12-
15 months of age. Other updated or new sections include a) a listing of vaccines
and other immunobiologics available in the United States by type and recom-
mended routes, advice on the proper storage and handling of immunobiologics,
a section on the recommended routes for administration of vaccines, and dis-
cussion of the use of jet injectors; b) revisions in the guidelines for spacing
administration of immune globulin preparations and live virus vaccines, a dis-
cussion of vaccine interactions and recommendations for the simultaneous
administration of multiple vaccines, a section on the interchangeability of vac-
cines from different manufacturers, and a discussion of hypersensitivity to
vaccine components; c) a discussion of vaccination during pregnancy, a section
on breast-feeding and vaccination, recommendations for the vaccination of pre-
mature infants, and updated schedules for immunizing infants and children
(including recommendations for the use of Haemophilus influenzae type b con-
jugate vaccines); d) sections on the immunization of hemophiliacs and
immunocompromised persons; e) discussion of the Standards for Pediatric lm-
munization Practices (including a new table of contraindications and
precautions to vaccination), information on the National Vaccine Injury Compen-
sation Program, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, and Vaccine
Information Pamphlets; and f) guidelines for vaccinating persons without docu-
mentation of immunization, a section on vaccinations received outside the
United States, and a section on reporting of vaccine-preventable diseases.
These recommendations are based on information available before publishing
and are not comprehensive for each vaccine. The most recentAdvisory Commit-
tee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for each specific
vaccine should be consulted for more details.

INTRODUCTION
Recommendations for vaccinating infants, children, and adults are based on char-
acteristics of immunobiologics, scientific knowledge about the principles of active and
passive immunization and the epidemiology of diseases, and judgments by public

health officials and specialists in clinical and preventive medicine. Beneﬁts and risks
are associated with the use of all immunobiologics: no vaccine is completely safe or
completely effective. Benefits of vaccination range from partial to complete protection
against the consequences of infection, ranging from asymptomatic or mild infection
to severe consequences, such as paralysis or death. Risks of vaccination range from
common, minor, and inconvenient side effects to rare, severe, and life-threatening
conditions. Thus, recommendations for immunization practices balance scientific evi-
dence of benefits, costs, and risks to achieve optimal levels of protection against
infectious disease. These recommendations describe this balance and attempt to
minimize risk by providing information regarding dose, route, and spacing of im-
munobiologics and delineating situations that warrant precautions or contraindicate
the use of these immunobiologics. These recommendations are for use only in the
United States because vaccines and epidemiologic circumstances often differ in other
countries. Individual circumstances may warrant deviations from these recommenda-
tions. The relative balance of benefits and risks can change as diseases are controlled
or eradicated. For example, because smallpox has been eradicated throughout the
world, the risk of complications associated with smallpox vaccine (vaccinia virus) now
outweighs any theoretical risk of contracting smallpox or related viruses for the gen-
eral population. Consequently, smallpox vaccine is no longer recommended routinely
for civilians or most military personnel. Smallpox vaccine is now recommended only
for selected laboratory and health-care workers with certain defined exposures to
these viruses (2 ).
IMMUNOBIOLOGICS
The specific nature and content of immunobiologics can differ. When immunobi-
ologics against the same infectious agents are produced by different manufacturers,
active and inert ingredients in the various products are not always the same. Practitio-
ners are urged to become familiar with the constituents of the products they use.
suspending Fluids
These may be sterile water, saline, or complex fluids containing protein or other
constituents derived from the medium or biologic system in which the vaccine is pro-
duced (e.g., serum proteins, egg antigens, and cell-culture-derived antigens).
Preservatives, Stabilizers, Antibiotics
These components of vaccines, antitoxins, and globulins are used to inhibit or pre-
vent bacterial growth in viral cultures or the final product, or to stabilize the antigens
or antibodies. Allergic reactions can occur if the recipient is sensitive to one of these
additives (e.g., mercurials [thimerosal], phenols, albumin, glycine, and neomycin).
Adjuvants
Many antigens evoke suboptimal immunologic responses. Efforts to enhance im-
munogenicity include mixing antigens with a variety of substances or adjuvants (e.g.,
aluminum adjuvants such as aluminum phosphate or aluminum hydroxide).

Vol. 43 / No. RR-1 MMWR 3
Storage and Handling of immunobiologics
Failure to adhere to recommended specifications for storage and handling of im-
munobiologics can make these products impotent (3 ). Recommendations included in
a product's package inserts, including reconstitution of vaccines, should be followed
closely to assure maximum potency of vaccines. Vaccine quality is the shared respon-
sibility of all parties from the time the vaccine is manufactured until administration. in
general, all vaccines should be inspected and monitored to assure that the cold chain
has been maintained during shipment and storage. Vaccines should be stored at rec-
ommended temperatures immediately upon receipt. Certain vaccines, such as oral
polio vaccine (OPV) and yellow fever vaccine, are very sensitive to increased tempera-
ture. Other vaccines are sensitive to freezing, including diphtheria and tetanus toxoids
and pertussis vaccine, adsorbed (DTP), diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular
pertussis vaccine, adsorbed (DTaP), diphtheria and tetanus toxoids for pediatric use
(DT), tetanus and diphtheria toxoids for adult use (Td), inactivated poliovirus vaccine
(IPV), Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (Hib), hepatitis B vaccine,
pneumococcal vaccine, and influenza vaccine. Mishandled vaccine may not be easily
distinguished from potent vaccine. When in doubt about the appropriate handling of
a vaccine, contact the manufacturer.
ADMINISTRATION OF VACCINES
General Instructions
Persons administering vaccines should take the necessary precautions to minimize
risk for spreading disease. They should be adequately immunized against hepatitis B,
measles, mumps, rubella, and influenza. Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids are recom-
mended for all persons. Hands should be washed before each new patient is seen.
Gloves are not required when administering vaccinations, unless the persons who
administer the vaccine will come into contact with potentially infectious body fluids or
have open lesions on their hands. Syringes and needles used for injections must be
sterile and preferably disposable to minimize the risk of contamination. A separate
needle and syringe should be used for each injection. Different vaccines should not be
mixed in the same syringe unless specifically licensed for such use.* Disposable nee-
dles and syringes should be discarded in labeled, puncture-proof containers to
prevent inadvertent needlestick injury or reuse.
Routes of administration are recommended for each immunobiologic (Table 1). To
avoid unnecessary local or systemic effects and to ensure optimal efficacy, the practi-
tioner should not deviate from the recommended routes. lnjectable immunobiologics
should be administered where there is little likelihood of local, neural, vascular, or
tissue injury. In general, vaccines containing adjuvants should be injected into the
muscle mass; when administered subcutaneously or intradermally they can cause lo-
cal irritation, induration, skin discoloration, inflammation, and granuloma formation.
Before the vaccine is expelled into the body, the needle should be inserted into the
*The only vaccines currently licensed to be mixed in the same syringe by the person adminis-
tering the vaccine are PRP-T Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine, lyophilized,
which can be reconstituted with DTP vaccine produced by Connaught. This PRP-T/DTP com-
bination was licensed by the FDA on November 18, 1993.

Subcutaneous injections are usually administered into the thigh of infants and in
the deltoid area of older children and adults. A 5/8- to 3/4-inch, 23- to 25-gauge needle
should be inserted into the tissues below the dermal layer of the skin.
Intramuscular Injections
The preferred sites for intramuscular injections are the anterolateral aspect of the
upper thigh and the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. The buttock should not be used
routinely for active vaccination of infants, children, or adults because of the potential
risk of injury to the sciatic nerve (5 ). In addition, injection into the buttock has been
associated with decreased immunogenicity of hepatitis B and rabies vaccines in
adults, presumably because of inadvertent subcutaneous injection or injection into
deep fat tissue (6). If the buttock is used for passive immunization when large vol-
umes are to be injected or multiple doses are necessary (e.g., large doses of immune
globulin [IG]), the central region should be avoided; only the upper, outer quadrant
should be used, and the needle should be directed anteriorly (i.e., not inferiorly or
perpendicular to the skin) to minimize the possibility of involvement with the sciatic
nerve (7).
For all intramuscular injections, the needle should be long enough to reach the
muscle mass and prevent vaccine from seeping into subcutaneous tissue, but not so
long as to endanger underlying neurovascular structures or bone. Vaccinators should
be familiar with the structural anatomy of the area into which they are injecting vac-
cine. An individual decision on needle size and site of injection must be made for each
person based on age, the volume of the material to be administered, the size of the
muscle, and the depth below the muscle surface into which the material is to be in-
jected.
Infants (<12 months of age). Among most infants, the anterolateral aspect of the
thigh provides the largest muscle mass and is therefore the recommended site. How-
ever, the deltoid can also be used with the thigh; for example, when multiple vaccines
must be administered at the same visit. In most cases, a 7/8- to l-inch, 22- to 25-gauge
needle is sufficient to penetrate muscle in the thigh of a 4-month-old infant. The free
hand should bunch the muscle, and the needle should be directed inferiorly along the
long axis of the leg at an angle appropriate to reach the muscle while avoiding nearby
neurovascular structures and bone.
Toddlers and Older Children. The deltoid may be used if the muscle mass is ade-
quate. The needle size can range from 22 to 25 gauge and from 5/8 to 1% inches,
based on the size of the muscle. As with infants, the anterolateral thigh may be used,
but the needle should be longer—generally ranging from 7/8 to 1% inches.
Adults. The deltoid is recommended for routine intramuscular vaccination among
adults, particularly for hepatitis B vaccine. The suggested needle size is 1 to 1% inches
and 20 to 25 gauge.

intradermal Injections
intradermal injections are generally administered on the volar surface of the fore-
arm, except for human diploid cell rabies vaccine (HDCV) for which reactions are less
severe when administered in the deltoid area. With the bevel facing upwards, a 3/8- to
3/4-inch, 25- or 27-gauge needle can be inserted into the epidermis at an angle parallel
to the long axis of the forearm. The needle should be inserted so the entire bevel
penetrates the skin and the injected solution raises a small bleb. Because of the small
amounts of antigen used in intradermal injections, care must be taken not to inject the
vaccine subcutaneously because it can result in a suboptimal immunologic response.
Multiple Vaccinations
If more than one vaccine preparation is administered or if vaccine and an immune
globulin preparation are administered simultaneously, it is preferable to administer
each at a different anatomic site. It is also preferable to avoid administering two intra-
muscular injections in the same limb, especially if DTP is one of the products
administered. However, if more than one injection must be administered in a single
limb, the thigh is usually the preferred site because of the greater muscle mass; the
injections should be sufficiently separated (i.e., 1-2 inches apart) so that any local re-
actions are unlikely to overlap (8,9).
Jet Injectors
Jet injectors that use the same nozzle tip to vaccinate more than one person (mul-
tiple-use nozzle jet injectors) have been used worldwide since 1952 to administer
vaccines when many persons must be vaccinated with the same vaccine within a
short time period. These jet injectors have been generally considered safe and effec-
tive for delivering vaccine if used properly by trained personnel; the safety and
efficacy of vaccine administered by these jet injectors are considered comparable to
vaccine administered by needle and syringe.
The multiple-use nozzle jet injector most widely used in the United States (Ped-o-
Jet) has never been implicated in transmission of bloodborne diseases. However, the
report of an outbreak of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission following use of one type
of multiple-use nozzle jet injector in a weight loss clinic and laboratory studies in
which blood contamination of jet injectors has been simulated have caused concern
that the use of multiple-use nozzle jet injectors may pose a potential hazard of
bloodborne-disease transmission to vaccine recipients (10 ). This potential risk for dis-
ease transmission would exist if the jet injector nozzle became contaminated with
blood during an injection and was not properly cleaned and disinfected before sub-
sequent injections. The potential risk of bloodborne-disease transmission would be
greater when vaccinating persons at increased risk for bloodborne diseases such as
HBV or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection because of behavioral or other
risk factors (11,12).
Multiple-use nozzle jet injectors can be used in certain situations in which large
numbers of persons must be rapidly vaccinated with the same vaccine, the use of
needles and syringes is not practical, and state and-or local health authorities judge
that the public health benefit from the use of the jet injector outweighs the small po-
tential risk of bloodborne-disease transmission. This potential risk can be minimized

by training health-care workers before the vaccine campaign on the proper use of jet
injectors and by changing the injector tip or removing the jet injector from use if there
is evidence of contamination with blood or other body fluid. In addition, mathematical
and animal models suggest that the potential risk for bloodborne-disease transmis-
sion can be substantially reduced by swabbing the stationary injector tip with alcohol
or acetone after each injection. it is advisable to consult sources experienced in the
use of jet injectors (e.g., state or local health departments) before beginning a vaccina-
tion program in which these injectors will be used. Manufacturer's directions for use
and maintenance of the jet injector devices should be followed closely.
Newer models of jet injectors that employ single-use disposable nozzle tips should
not pose a potential risk of bloodborne disease transmission if used appropriately.
Regurgitated Oral Vaccine
infants may sometimes fail to swallow oral preparations (e.g., oral poliovirus vac-
cine IOPVI) after administration. if, in the judgment of the person administering the
vaccine, a substantial amount of vaccine is spit out, regurgitated, or vomited shortly
after administration (i.e., within 5-10 minutes), another dose can be administered at
the same visit. If this repeat dose is not retained, neither dose should be counted, and
the vaccine should be re-administered at the next visit.
Non-Standard Vaccination Practices
The recommendations on route, site, and dosages of immunobiologics are derived
from theoretical considerations, experimental trials, and clinical experience. The Advi-
sory Committee on immunization Practices (ACIP) strongly discourages any variations
from the recommended route, site, volume, or number of doses of any vaccine.
Varying from the recommended route and site can result in a) inadequate protec-
tion (e.g., when hepatitis B vaccine is administered in the gluteal area rather than the
deltoid muscle or when vaccines are administered intradermally rather than intramus-
cularly) and b) increased risk for reactions (e.g., when DTP is administered
subcutaneously rather than intramuscularly). Administration of volumes smaller than
those recommended, such as split doses, can result in inadequate protection. Use of
larger than the recommended dose can be hazardous because of excessive local or
systemic concentrations of antigens or other vaccine constituents. The use of multiple
reduced doses that together equal a full immunizing dose or the use of smaller divided
doses is not endorsed or recommended. The serologic response, clinical efficacy, and
frequency and severity of adverse reactions with such schedules have not been ade-
quately studied. Any vaccination using less than the standard dose or a nonstandard
route or site of administration should not be counted, and the person should be revac-
cinated according to age. if a medically documented concern exists that revaccination
may result in an increased risk of adverse effects because of repeated prior exposure
from nonstandard vaccinations, immunity to most relevant antigens can be tested se-
rologically to assess the need for revaccination.
AGE AT WHICH IMMUNOBIOLOGICS ARE ADMINISTERED
Recommendations for the age at which vaccines are administered (Tables 3-5)
are influenced by several factors: age-specific risks of disease, age-specific risks of

dose of Td to complete a primary series for tetanus and diphtheria).
§When polio vaccine is administered to previously unvaccinated persons 218 years of age, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) is
preferred. For the immunization schedule for IPV, see specific ACIP statement on the use of polio vaccine.
1Persons born before 1957 can generally be considered immune to measles and mumps and need not be vaccinated. Rubella (or
MMR) vaccine can be administered to persons of any age, particularly to nonpregnant women of childbearing age.
**Hepatitis B vaccine, recombinant. Selected high-risk groups for whom vaccination is recommended include persons with occupational
risk, such as health-care and public-safety workers who have occupational exposure to blood, clients and staff of institutions for the
developmentally disabled, hemodialysis patients, recipients of certain blood products (e.g., clotting factor concentrates), household
contacts and sex partners of hepatitis B virus carriers, injecting drug users, sexually active homosexual and bisexual men, certain
sexually active heterosexual men and women, inmates of long-term correctional facilities, certain international travelers, and families
of HBsAg-positive adoptees from countries where HBV infection is endemic. Because risk factors are often not identified directly
among adolescents, universal hepatitis B vaccination of teenagers should be implemented in communities where injecting drug use,
pregnancy among teenagers, and-or sexually transmitted diseases are common.
"The ACIP recommends a second dose of measles-containing vaccine (preferably MMR to assure immunity to mumps and rubella)
for certain groups. Children with no documentation of live measles vaccination after the first birthday should receive two doses of
live measles-containing vaccine not less than 1 month apart. In addition, the following persons born in 1957 or later should have

complications, ability of persons of a given age to respond to the vaccineis), and po-
tential interference with the immune response by passively transferred maternal
antibody. in general, vaccines are recommended for the youngest age group at risk for
developing the disease whose members are known to develop an adequate antibody
response to vaccination.
SPACING OF IMMUNOBIOLOGICS
Interval Between Multiple Doses of Same Antigen
Some products require administration of more than one dose for development
of an adequate antibody response. in addition, some products require periodic
reinforcement or booster doses to maintain protection. in recommending the ages
and intervals for multiple doses, the ACIP considers risks from disease and the need
to induce or maintain satisfactory protection (Tables 3-5).
Longer-than-recommended intervals between doses do not reduce final antibody
concentrations. Therefore, an interruption in the immunization schedule does not
require reinstitution of the entire series of an immunobiologic or the addition of extra
doses. However, administering doses of a vaccine or toxoid at less than the recom-
mended minimum intervals may decrease the antibody response and therefore
should be avoided. Doses administered at less than the recommended minimum in-
tervals should not be considered part of a primary series.
Some vaccines produce increased rates of local or systemic reactions in certain
recipients when administered too frequently (e.g., adult Td, pediatric DT, tetanus
toxoid, and rabies vaccines). Such reactions are thought to result from the formation
of antigen-antibody complexes. Good recordkeeping, maintaining careful patient his-
tories, and adherence to recommended schedules can decrease the incidence of such
reactions without sacrificing immunity.
Simultaneous Administration
Experimental evidence and extensive clinical experience have strengthened the
scientific basis for administering certain vaccines simultaneously (13-16). Many of
the commonly used vaccines can safely and effectively be administered simultane-
ously (i.e., on the same day, not at the same anatomic site). Simultaneous
administration is important in certain situations, including a) imminent exposure to
several infectious diseases, b) preparation for foreign travel, and c) uncertainty that
the person will return for further doses of vaccine.
Killed vaccines
In general, inactivated vaccines can be administered simultaneously at separate
sites. However, when vaccines commonly associated with local or systemic reactions
(e.g., cholera, parenteral typhoid, and plague) are administered simultaneously, the
reactions might be accentuated. When feasible, it is preferable to administer these
vaccines on separate occasions.


## p. 13 (#237) #############################################

Vol. 43 / No. FIR-1 MMWR 13
Live vaccines
The simultaneous administration of the most widely used live and inactivated vac-
cines has not resulted in impaired antibody responses or increased rates of adverse
reactions. Administration of combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine yields
results similar to administration of individual measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines
at different sites. Therefore, there is no medical basis for administering these vaccines
separately for routine vaccination instead of the preferred MMR combined vaccine.
Concern has been raised that oral live attenuated typhoid (Ty21a) vaccine theoreti-
cally might interfere with the immune response to OPV when OPV is administered
simultaneously or soon after live oral typhoid vaccine (17). However, no published
data exist to support this theory. Therefore, if OPV and oral live typhoid vaccine are
needed at the same time (e.g., when international travel is undertaken on short no-
tice), both vaccines may be administered simultaneously or at any interval before or
after each other.
Routine childhood vaccines
Simultaneous administration of all indicated vaccines is important in childhood
vaccination programs because it increases the probability that a child will be fully im-
munized at the appropriate age. During a recent measles outbreak, one study
indicated that about one third of measles cases among unvaccinated preschool chil-
dren could have been prevented if MMR had been administered at the same time
another vaccine had been received (18 ).
The simultaneous administration of routine childhood vaccines does not interfere
with the immune response to these vaccines. When administered at the same time
and at separate sites, DTP, OPV, and MMR have produced seroconversion rates and
rates of side effects similar to those observed when the vaccines are administered
separately ( 13). Simultaneous vaccination of infants with DTP, OPV (or IPV), and either
Hib vaccine or hepatitis B vaccine has resulted in acceptable response to all antigens
(14-16). Routine simultaneous administration of DTP (or DTaP), OPV (or lPV), Hib
vaccine, MMR, and hepatitis B vaccine is encouraged for children who are the recom-
mended age to receive these vaccines and for whom no specific contraindications
exist at the time of the visit, unless, in the judgment of the provider, complete vaccina-
tion of the child will not be compromised by administering different vaccines at
different visits. Simultaneous administration is particularly important if the child
might not return for subsequent vaccinations. Administration of MMR and Hib vaccine
at 12-15 months of age, followed by DTP (or DTaP, if indicated) at age 18 months re-
mains an acceptable alternative for children with caregivers known to be compliant
with other health-care recommendations and who are likely to return for future visits;
hepatitis B vaccine can be administered at either ofthese two visits. DTaP may be used
instead of DTP only for the fourth and fifth dose for children 15 months of age through
6 years (i.e., before the seventh birthday). individual vaccines should not be mixed in
the same syringe unless they are licensed for mixing by the U5. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).*
*The only vaccines currently licensed to be mixed in the same syringe by the person adminis-
tering the vaccine are PRP-T Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine, lyophilized,
which can be reconstituted with DTP vaccine produced by Connaught. This PRP-T/DTP com-
bination was licensed by the FDA on November 18, 1993.


## p. 14 (#238) #############################################

14 MMWR January 28, 1994
Other vaccines
The simultaneous administration of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and
whole-virus influenza vaccine elicits a satisfactory antibody response without increas-
ing the incidence or severity of adverse reactions in adults (19 ). Simultaneous
administration of pneumococcal vaccine and split-virus influenza vaccine can be ex-
pected to yield satisfactory results in both children and adults.
Hepatitis B vaccine administered with yellow fever vaccine is as safe and effica-
cious as when these vaccines are administered separately (20 ). Measles and yellow
fever vaccines have been administered together safely and with full efficacy of each of
the components (21 ).
The antibody response of yellow fever and cholera vaccines is decreased if admin-
istered simultaneously or within a short time of each other. If possible, yellow fever
and cholera vaccinations should be separated by at least 3 weeks. If time constraints
exist and both vaccines are necessary, the injections can be administered simultane-
ously or within a 3-week period with the understanding that antibody response may
not be optimal. Yellow fever vaccine is required by many countries and is highly effec-
tive in protecting against a disease with substantial mortality and for which no therapy
exists. The currently used cholera vaccine provides limited protection of brief dura-
tion; few indications exist for its use.
Antimalarials and vaccination
The antimalarial mefloquine (Lariam®) could potentially affect the immune re-
sponse to oral live attenuated typhoid (Ty21a) vaccine if both are taken simultaneously
(17,22,23 ). To minimize this effect, it may be prudent to administer Ty21a typhoid vac-
cine at least 24 hours before or after a dose of mefloquine. Because chloroquine
phosphate (and possibly other structurally related antimalarials such as mefloquine)
may interfere with the antibody response to HDCV when HDCV is administered by the
intradermal dose-route, HDCV should not be administered by the intradermal
dose-route when chloroquine, mefloquine, or other structurally related antimalarials
are used (24-26 ).
Nonsimultaneous Administration
Inactivated vaccines generally do not interfere with the immune response to other
inactivated vaccines or to live vaccines except in certain instances (e.g., yellow fever
and cholera vaccines). In general, an inactivated vaccine can be administered either
simultaneously or at any time before or after a different inactivated vaccine or live
vaccine. However, limited data have indicated that prior or concurrent administration
of DTP vaccine may enhance anti-PRP antibody response following vaccination with
certain Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines (i.e., PRP-T, PRP-D, and
HbOC) (27-29 ). For infants, the immunogenicity of PRP-0MP appears to be unaffected
by the absence of prior or concurrent DTP vaccination (28,30 ).
Theoretically, the immune response to one live-virus vaccine might be impaired if
administered within 30 days of another live-virus vaccine; however no evidence exists
for currently available vaccines to support this concern (31 ). Whenever possible, live-
virus vaccines administered on different days should be administered at least 30 days
apart (Table 6). However, OPV and MMR vaccines can be administered at any time


## p. 15 (#239) #############################################

Vol. 43 I No. RR-1 MMWR 15
before, with, or after each other, if indicated. Live-virus vaccines can interfere with the
response to a tuberculin test (32-34 ). Tuberculin testing, if otherwise indicated, can be
done either on the same day that live-virus vaccines are administered or 4-6 weeks
later.
Immune Globulin
Live vaccines
OPV and yellow fever vaccines can be administered at any time before, with, or
after the administration of immune globulin or specific immune globulins (e.g., hepa-
titis B immune globulin [HBIG] and rabies immune globulin [RlGll (Table 7) (35 ). The
concurrent administration of immune globulin should not interfere with the immune
response to oral Ty21a typhoid vaccine.
Previous recommendations, based on data from persons who received low doses
of immune globulin, have stated that MMR and its individual component vaccines can
be administered as early as 6 weeks to 3 months after administration of immune
globulin (1,36 ). However, recent evidence suggests that high doses of immune globu-
lin can inhibit the immune response to measles vaccine for more than 3 months
(37,38 ). Administration of immune globulin can also inhibit the response to rubella
vaccine (37). The effect of immune globulin preparations on the response to mumps
and varicella vaccines is unknown, but commercial immune globulin preparations
contain antibodies to these viruses.
Blood (e.g., whole blood, packed red blood cells, and plasma) and other antibody-
containing blood products (e.g., immune globulin; specific immune globulins; and
immune globulin, intravenous llGlVl) can diminish the immune response to MMR or
its individual component vaccines. Therefore, after-an immune globulin preparation is
received, these vaccines should not be administered before the recommended
interval (Tables 7 and 8). However, the postpartum vaccination of rubella-susceptible
women with rubella or MMR vaccine should not be delayed because anti-RholD)
lG (human) or any other blood product was received during the last trimester of

optimal.

pregnancy or at delivery. These women should be vaccinated immediately after deliv-
ery and, if possible, tested at least 3 months later to ensure immunity to rubella and,
if necessary, to measles.
If administration of an immune globulin preparation becomes necessary because
of imminent exposure to disease, MMR or its component vaccines can be admin-
istered simultaneously with the immune globulin preparation, although vaccine-
induced immunity might be compromised. The vaccine should be administered at a
site remote from that chosen for the immune globulin inoculation. Unless serologic
testing indicates that specific antibodies have been produced, vaccination should be
repeated after the recommended interval (Tables 7 and 8).
If administration of an immune globulin preparation becomes necessary after
MMR or its individual component vaccines have been administered, interference can

occur. Usually, vaccine virus replication and stimulation of immunity will occur
1-2 weeks after vaccination. Thus, if the interval between administration of any of
these vaccines and subsequent administration of an immune globulin preparation is
<14 days, vaccination should be repeated after the recommended interval (Tables 7
and 8), unless serologic testing indicates that antibodies were produced.
Killed vaccines
immune globulin preparations interact less with inactivated vaccines and toxoids
than with live vaccines (39). Therefore, administration of inactivated vaccines and
toxoids either simultaneously with or at any interval before or after receipt of immune
globulins should not substantially impair the development of a protective antibody
response. The vaccine or toxoid and immune globulin preparation should be adminis-
tered at different sites using the standard recommended dose of corresponding
vaccine. Increasing the vaccine dose volume or number of vaccinations is not indi-
cated or recommended.
Interchangeability of Vaccines from Different Manufacturers
When at least one dose of a hepatitis B vaccine produced by one manufacturer is
followed by subsequent doses from a different manufacturer, the immune response
has been shown to be comparable with that resulting from a full course of vaccination
with a single vaccine (11,40).
Both HDCV and rabies vaccine, adsorbed (RVA) are considered equally efficacious
and safe and, when used as licensed and recommended, are considered interchange-
able during the vaccine series. RVA should not be used intradermally. The full 1.0-mL
dose of either product, administered by intramuscular injection, can be used for both
preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis (25 ).
When administered according to their licensed indications, different diphtheria and
tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccines as single antigens or various combinations, as
well as the live and inactivated polio vaccines, also can be used interchangeably. How-
ever, published data supporting this recommendation are generally limited (41 ).
Currently licensed Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines have been
shown to induce different temporal patterns of immunologic response in infants (42 ).
Limited data suggest that infants who receive sequential doses of different vaccines
produce a satisfactory antibody response after a complete primary series (43-45 ). The
primary vaccine series should be completed with the same Hib vaccine, if feasible.
However, if different vaccines are administered, a total of three doses of Hib vaccine is
considered adequate for the primary series among infants, and any combination of
Hib conjugate vaccines licensed for use among infants (i.e., PRP-OMP, PRP-T, HbOC,
and combination DTP-Hib vaccines) may be used to complete the primary series. Any
of the licensed conjugate vaccines can be used for the recommended booster dose at
12-18 months of age (Tables 3 and 4).
HYPERSENSITIVITY TO VACCINE COMPONENTS
Vaccine components can cause allergic reactions in some recipients. These reac-
tions can be local or systemic and can include mild to severe anaphylaxis or
anaphylactic-like responses (e.g., generalized urticaria or hives, wheezing, swelling of


## p. 19 (#243) #############################################

Vol. 43 I No. RR-1 MMWR 19
the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, and shock). The responsible
vaccine components can derive from a) vaccine antigen, b) animal protein, c) antibiot-
ics, d) preservatives, and e) stabilizers.
The most common animal protein allergen is egg protein found in vaccines pre-
pared using embryonated chicken eggs (e.g., influenza and yellow fever vaccines) or
chicken embryo cell cultures (e.g., measles and mumps vaccines). Ordinarily, persons
who are able to eat eggs or egg products safely can receive these vaccines; persons
with histories of anaphylactic or anaphylactic-like allergy to eggs or egg proteins
should not. Asking persons if they can eat eggs without adverse effects is a reason-
able way to determine who might be at risk for allergic reactions from receiving
measles, mumps, yellow fever, and influenza vaccines. Protocols requiring caution
have been developed for testing and vaccinating with measles, mumps, and MMR
vaccines those persons with anaphylactic reactions to egg ingestion (46-49). A regi-
men for administering influenza vaccine to children with egg hypersensitivity and
severe asthma has also been developed (50 ). Rubella vaccine is grown in human dip-
loid cell cultures and can safely be administered to persons with histories of severe
allergy to eggs or egg proteins.
Some vaccines contain trace amounts of antibiotics (e.g., neomycin) to which pa-
tients may be hypersensitive. The information provided in the vaccine package insert
should be carefully reviewed before deciding if the uncommon patient with such hy-
persensitivity should receive the vaccine(s). No currently recommended vaccine
contains penicillin or penicillin derivatives.
MMR and its individual component vaccines contain trace amounts of neomycin.
Although the amount present is less than would usually be used for the skin test to
determine hypersensitivity, persons who have experienced anaphylactic reactions to
neomycin should not receive these vaccines. Most often, neomycin allergy is a contact
dermatitis-a manifestation of a delayed-type (cell-mediated) immune response-
rather than anaphylaxis. A history of delayed-type reactions to neomycin is not a
contraindication for these vaccines.
Certain parenteral bacterial vaccines such as cholera, DTP, plague, and typhoid are
frequently associated with local or systemic adverse effects, such as redness, sore-
ness, and fever. These reactions are difficult to link with a specific sensitivity to vaccine
components and appear to be toxic rather than hypersensitive. Urticarial or anaphy-
lactic reactions in DTP, DT, Td, or tetanus toxoid recipients have been reported rarely.
When these reactions are reported, appropriate skin tests can be performed to deter-
mine sensitivity to tetanus toxoid before its use is discontinued (51 ). Alternatively,
serologic testing to determine immunity to tetanus can be performed to evaluate the
need for a booster dose of tetanus toxoid.
Exposure to vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal (e.g., DTP, DTaP, DT,
Td, Hib, hepatitis B, influenza, and Japanese encephalitis) can lead to induction of
hypersensitivity. However, most patients do not develop reactions to thimerosal given
as a component of vaccines even when patch or intradermal tests for thimerosal
indicate hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity to thimerosal usually consists of local
delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (52,53 ).

VACCINATION OF PRETERM INFANTS
Infants born prematurely, regardless of birthweight, should be vaccinated at the
same chronological age and according to the same schedule and precautions as full-
term infants and children (Tables 3 and 4). Birthweight and size generally are not
factors in deciding whether to postpone routine vaccination of a clinically stable pre-
mature infant (54-56). The full recommended dose of each vaccine should be used.
Divided or reduced doses are not recommended (57). To prevent the theoretical risk
of poliovirus transmission in the hospital, the administration of OPV should be de-
ferred until discharge.
Any premature infant born to a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAgl-positive mother
should receive immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG beginning at or
shortly after birth. For premature infants of HBsAg-negative mothers, the optimal tim-
ing of hepatitis B vaccination has not been determined. Some studies suggest that
decreased seroconversion rates might occur in some premature infants with low
birthweights li.e., <2000 grams) following administration of hepatitis B vaccine at birth
(58 ). Such low birthweight premature infants of HBsAg-negative mothers should re-
ceive the hepatitis B vaccine series, which can be initiated at discharge from the
nursery if the infant weighs at least 2000 grams or at 2 months of age along with DTP,
OPV, and Hib vaccine.
BREAST-FEEDING AND VACCINATION
Neither killed nor live vaccines affect the safety of breast-feeding for mothers or
infants. Breast-feeding does not adversely affect immunization and is not a contrain-
dication for any vaccine. Breast-fed infants should be vaccinated according to routine
recommended schedules (59-61).
inactivated or killed vaccines do not multiply within the body. Therefore they
should pose no special risk for mothers who are breast-feeding or for their infants.
Although live vaccines do multiply within the mother's body, most have not been
demonstrated to be excreted in breast milk. Although rubella vaccine virus may be
transmitted in breast milk, the virus usually does not infect the infant, and if it does,
the infection is well tolerated. There is no contraindication for vaccinating breast-
feeding mothers with yellow fever vaccine. Breast-feeding mothers can receive OPV
without any interruption in the feeding schedule.
VACCINATION DURING PREGNANCY
Risk from vaccination during pregnancy is largely theoretical. The benefit of vacci-
nation among pregnant women usually outweighs the potential risk when a) the risk
for disease exposure is high, b) infection would pose a special risk to the mother or
fetus, and c) the vaccine is unlikely to cause harm.
Combined tetanus and diphtheria toxoids are the only lmmunobiologic agents rou-
tinely indicated for susceptible pregnant women. Previously vaccinated pregnant
women who have not received a Td vaccination within the last 10 years should receive
a booster dose. Pregnant women who are unimmunized or only partially immunized
against tetanus should complete the primary series. Depending on when a woman

Vol. 43 / No. RR-1 MMWR 21
seeks prenatal care and the required interval between doses, one or two doses of Td
can be administered before delivery. Women for whom the vaccine is indicated but
who have not completed the required three-dose series during pregnancy should be
followed up after delivery to assure they receive the doses necessary for protection.
There is no convincing evidence of risk from vaccinating pregnant women with
other inactivated virus or bacteria vaccines or toxoids. Hepatitis B vaccine is recom-
mended for women at risk for hepatitis B infection, and influenza and pneumococcal
vaccines are recommended for women at risk for infection and for complications of
influenza and pneumococcal disease.
OPV can be administered to pregnant women who are at substantial risk of immi-
nent exposure to natural infection (62). Although OPV is preferred, IPV may be
considered if the complete vaccination series can be administered before the antici-
pated exposure. Pregnant women who must travel to areas where the risk for yellow
fever is high should receive yellow fever vaccine. in these circumstances, the small
theoretical risk from vaccination is far outweighed by the risk of yellow fever infection
(21,63 ). Known pregnancy is a contraindication for rubella, measles, and mumps vac-
cines. Although of theoretical concern, no cases of congenital rubella syndrome or
abnormalities attributable to a rubella vaccine virus infection have been observed in
infants born to susceptible mothers who received rubella vaccine during pregnancy.
Persons who receive measles, mumps, or rubella vaccines can shed these viruses
but generally do not transmit them. These vaccines can be administered safely to the
children of pregnant women. Although live polio virus is shed by persons recently
vaccinated with OPV (particularly after the first dose), this vaccine can also be admin-
istered to the children of pregnant women because experience has not revealed any
risk of polio vaccine virus to the fetus.
All pregnant women should be evaluated for immunity to rubella and tested for the
presence of HBsAg. Women susceptible to rubella should be vaccinated immediately
after delivery. A woman infected with HBV should be followed carefully to assure the
infant receives HBIG and begins the hepatitis B vaccine series shortly after birth.
There is no known risk to the fetus from passive immunization of pregnant women
with immune globulin preparations. Further information regarding immunization of
pregnant women is available in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-
gists Technical Bulletin Number 160, October 1991. This publication is available from
the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Attention: Resource Center,
409 12th Street SW, Washington, DC 20024-2188.
ALTERED IMMUNOCOMPETENCE
The ACIP statement on vaccinating immunocompromised persons summarizes
recommendations regarding the efficacy, safety, and use of specific vaccines and im-
mune globulin preparations for immunocompromised persons (64 ). ACIP statements
on individual vaccines or immune globulins also contain additional information re-
garding these issues.
Severe lmmunosuppression can be the result of congenital immunodeficiency, HIV
infection, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy or therapy with alkylating
agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large amounts of corticosteroids. Severe
complications have followed vaccination with live, attenuated virus vaccines and live

bacterial vaccines among immunocompromised patients (65-71 ). in general, these
patients should not receive live vaccines except in certain circumstances that are
noted below. in addition, OPV should not be administered to any household contact of
a severely immunocompromised person. If polio immunization is indicated for immu-
nocompromised patients, their household members, or other close contacts, IPV
should be administered. MMR vaccine is not contraindicated in the close contacts
of immunocompromised patients. The degree to which a person is immunocom-
promised should be determined by a physician.
Limited studies of MMR vaccination in HIV-infected patients have not documented
serious or unusual adverse events. Because measles may cause severe illness in per-
sons with HIV infection, MMR vaccine is recommended for all asymptomatic
HIV-infected persons and should be considered for all symptomatic HIV-infected
persons. HIV-infected persons on regular IGIV therapy may not respond to MMR or its
individual component vaccines because of the continued presence of passively ac-
quired antibody. However, because of the potential benefit, measles vaccination
should be considered approximately 2 weeks before the next monthly dose of IGIV (if
not otherwise contraindicated), although an optimal immune response is unlikely to
occur. Unless serologic testing indicates that specific antibodies have been produced,
vaccination should be repeated (if not otherwise contraindicated) after the recom-
mended interval (Table 8).
An additional dose of IGIV should be considered for persons on routine IGIV ther-
apy who are exposed to measles 23 weeks after administration of a standard dose
(100-400 mg-kg) of 16W.
Killed or inactivated vaccines can be administered to all immunocompromised pa-
tients, although response to such vaccines may be suboptimal. All such childhood
vaccines are recommended for immunocompromised persons in usual doses and
schedules; in addition, certain vaccines such as pneumococcal vaccine or Hib vaccine
are recommended specifically for certain groups of immunocompromised patients,
including those with functional or anatomic asplenia.
Vaccination during chemotherapy or radiation therapy should be avoided because
antibody response is poor. Patients vaccinated while on immunosuppressive therapy
or in the 2 weeks before starting therapy should be considered unimmunized and
should be revaccinated at least 3 months after therapy is discontinued. Patients with
leukemia in remission whose chemotherapy has been terminated for 3 months may
receive live-virus vaccines.
The exact amount of systemically absorbed corticosteroids and the duration of ad-
ministration needed to suppress the immune system of an otherwise healthy child are
not well defined. Most experts agree that steroid therapy usually does not contraindi-
cate administration of live virus vaccine when it is short term (i.e., <2 weeks); low to
moderate dose; long-term, alternate-day treatment with short-acting preparations;
maintenance physiologic doses (replacement therapy); or administered topically (skin
or eyes), by aerosol, or by intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injection (64 ). Although of
recent theoretical concern, no evidence of increased severe reactions to live vaccines
has been reported among persons receiving steroid therapy by aerosol, and such ther-
apy is not in itself a reason to delay vaccination. The immunosuppressive effects of
steroid treatment vary, but many clinicians consider a dose equivalent to either
2 mg-kg of body weight or a total of 20 mg per day of prednisone as sufficiently

Vol. 43 / No. RR-1 MMWR 23
immunosuppressive to raise concern about the safety of vaccination with live virus
vaccines (64 ). Corticosteroids used in greater than physiologic doses also can reduce
the immune response to vaccines. Physicians should wait at least 3 months after dis-
continuation of therapy before administering a live-virus vaccine to patients who have
received high systemically absorbed doses of corticosteroids for 22 weeks.
VACCINATION OF PERSONS WITH HEMOPHILIA
Persons with bleeding disorders such as hemophilia have an increased risk of ac-
quiring hepatitis B and at least the same risk as the general population of acquiring
other vaccine-preventable diseases. However, because of the risk of hematomas, in-
tramuscular injections are often avoided among persons with bleeding disorders by
using the subcutaneous or intradermal routes for vaccines that are normally adminis-
tered by the intramuscular route. Hepatitis B vaccine administered intramuscularly to
153 hemophiiiacs using a 23-gauge needle, followed by steady pressure to the site for
1 to 2 minutes, has resulted in a 4% bruising rate with no patients requiring factor
supplementation (72 ). Whether an antigen that produces more local reactions, such
as pertussis, would produce an equally low rate of bruising is unknown.
When hepatitis B or any other intramuscular vaccine is indicated for a patient with
a bleeding disorder, it should be administered intramuscularly if, in the opinion of a
physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered
with reasonable safety by this route. if the patient receives antihemophilia or other
similar therapy, intramuscular vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy
is administered. A fine needle (523 gauge) can be used for the vaccination and firm
pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient or
family should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection.
MISCONCEPTIONS CONCERNING TRUE
CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS TO VACCINATION
Some health-care providers inappropriately consider certain conditions or circum-
stances to be true contraindications or precautions to vaccination. This misconception
results in missed opportunities to administer needed vaccines. Likewise, providers
may fail to understand what constitutes a true contraindication or precaution and may
administer a vaccine when it should be withheld. This practice can result in an in-
creased risk of an adverse reaction to the vaccine.
Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practice
National standards for pediatric immunization practices have been established and
include true contraindications and precautions to vaccination (Table 9) (73 ). True con-
traindications, applicable to all vaccines, include a history of anaphylactic or
anaphylactic-like reactions to the vaccine or a vaccine constituent (unless the recipient
has been desensitized) and the presence of a moderate or severe illness with or with-
out a fever. Except as noted previously, severely immunocompromised persons
should not receive live vaccines. Persons who developed an encephalopathy within
7 days of administration of a previous dose of DTP or DTaP should not receive further

* This information is based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) and those of the Committee on Infectious Diseases (Red Book Committee) of the American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Sometimes these recommendations vary from those contained in the
manufacturer's package inserts. For more detailed information, providers should consult the published
recommendations of the ACIP, AAP, and the manufacturer's package inserts.
The events or conditions listed as precautions, although not contraindications, should be carefully
reviewed. The benefits and risks of administering a specific vaccine to an individual under the
circumstances should be considered. If the risks are believed to outweigh the benefits, the vaccination
should be withheld; if the benefits are believed to outweigh the risks (for example, during an outbreak
or foreign travel), the vaccination should be administered. Whether and when to administer DTP to
children with proven or suspected underlying neurologic disorders should be decided on an individual
basis. It is prudent on theoretical grounds to avoid vaccination pregnant women. However, if immediate
protection against poliomyelitis is needed, OPV is preferred, although IPV may be considered if full
gvaccination can be completed before the anticipated imminent exposure.
Acetaminophen given before administering DTP and thereafter every 4 hours for 24 hours should be
considered for children with a personal or family history of convulsions in siblings or parents.
No data exist to substantiate the theoretical risk of a suboptimal immune response from the
administration of OPV and MMR within 30 days of each other.
** Persons with a history of anaphylactic reactions following egg ingestion should be vaccinated only with
caution. Protocols have been developed for vaccinating such persons and should be consulted. [J Pediatr

HMeasles vaccination may temporarily suppress tuberculin reactivity. lf testing can not be done the day

doses of DTP or DTaP. Persons infected with HIV, with household contacts infected
with HIV, or with known altered immunodeficiency should receive IPV ratherthan OPV.
Because of the theoretical risk to the fetus, women known to be pregnant should not
receive MMR.
Certain conditions are considered precautions rather than true contraindications
for vaccination. When faced with these conditions, some providers may elect to ad-
minister vaccine if they believe that the benefits outweigh the risks for the patient. For
example, caution should be exercised in vaccinating a child with DTP who, within
48 hours of receipt of a prior dose of DTP, developed fever 240.5 C (105 F); had
persistent, inconsolable crying for 23 hours; collapsed or developed a shock-like state;
or had a seizure within 3-days of receiving the previous dose of DTP.
Conditions often inappropriately regarded as contraindications to vaccination are
also noted (Table 9). Among the most important are diarrhea and minor upper-
respiratory illnesses with or without fever, mild to moderate local reactions to a
previous dose of vaccine, current antimicrobial therapy, and the convalescent phase
of an acute illness. Diarrhea is not a contraindication to OPV.
Febrile Illness
The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of a current or recent feb-
rile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and on the etiology of the disease.
All vaccines can be administered to persons with minor illness such as diarrhea,
mild upper-respiratory infection with or without low-grade fever, or other low-grade
febrile illness. Studies suggest that failure to vaccinate children with minor illness can
seriously impede vaccination efforts (74-76 ). Among persons whose compliance with
medical care cannot be assured, it is particularly important to take every opportunity
to provide appropriate vaccinations.
Most studies from developed and developing countries support the safety and effi-
cacy of vaccinating persons who have mild illness (77-79 ). One large ongoing study
in the United States has indicated that more than 97% of children with mild illnesses
develop measles antibody after vaccination (80). Only one study has reported a
somewhat lower rate of seroconversion (79%) to the measles component of MMR
vaccine among children with minor, afebrile upper-respiratory infection (81 ). There-
fore, vaccination should not be delayed because of the presence of mild respiratory
illness or other illness with or without fever.
Persons with moderate or severe febrile illness should be vaccinated as soon as
they have recovered from the acute phase of the illness. This precaution avoids super-
imposing adverse effects of the vaccine on the underlying illness or mistakenly
attributing a manifestation of the underlying illness to the vaccine.
Routine physical examinations and measuring temperatures are not prerequisites
for vaccinating infants and children who appear to be healthy. Asking the parent or
guardian if the child is ill and then postponing vaccination for those with moderate to
severe illness, or proceeding with vaccination if no contraindications exist, are appro-
priate procedures in childhood immunization programs.

REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS FOLLOWING
VACCINATION
Modern vaccines are safe and effective. However, some adverse events have been
reported following the administration of all vaccines. These events range from fre-
quent, minor, local reactions to extremely rare, severe, systemic illness, such as
paralysis associated with OPV. It is often impossible to establish evidence for cause-
and-effect relationships on the basis of case reports alone because temporal
association alone does not necessarily indicate causation. Unless the syndrome
following vaccination is clinically or pathologically distinctive, more detailed
epidemiologic studies to compare the incidence rates of the event in vaccinees with
the incidence rates among unvaccinated persons may be necessary. Reporting of se-
rious adverse events is extremely important to stimulate studies to confirm a causal
association and to study risk factors for adverse events. More complete information
on adverse reactions to a specific vaccine may be found in the AClP recommendations
for that vaccine.
Health-care providers are required to report selected events occurring after vacci-
nation to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Persons other than
health-care workers can also report adverse events to VAERS. Adverse events other
than those that must be reported or that occur after administration of other vaccines,
especially events that are serious or unusual, should also be reported to VAERS re-

VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION
The National Vaccine lnjury Compensation Program, established by the National
Childhood Vaccine lnjury Act of 1986, is a system under which compensation can be
paid on behalf of a person who was injured or died as a result of receiving a vaccine.
The program, which became effective on October 1, 1988, is intended as an alternative
to civil litigation under the traditional tort system in that negligence need not be
proven.
The law establishing the program also created a vaccine injury table, which lists the
vaccines covered by the program and the injuries, disabilities, illnesses, and condi-
tions (including death) for which compensation may be paid. The table also defines
the period of time during which the first symptom or substantial aggravation of the
injury must appear. Persons may be compensated for an injury listed in the estab-
lished table or one that can be demonstrated to result from administration of a listed
vaccine. Injuries following administration of vaccines not listed in the legislation
authorizing the program are not eligible for compensation through the program. Ad-
ditional information about the program is available from:

PATIENT INFORMATION
Parents, guardians, legal representatives, and adolescent and adult patients should
be informed about the benefits and risks of vaccine in understandable language. Op-
portunity for questions and answers should be provided before each vaccination.
Vaccine Information Pamphlets
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) requires that vaccine informa-
tion materials be developed for each vaccine covered by the Act (DTP or component
antigens, MMR or component antigens, IPV, and OPV). The resulting Vaccine informa-
tion Pamphlets must be used by allpublic and private providers of vaccines, although
private providers may elect to develop their own materials. Such materials must con-
tain the specific, detailed elements required by law. Copies of these pamphlets are
available from individual providers and from state health authorities responsible for
immunization (82 ).
Important Information Statements
CDC has developed important Information Statements for the vaccines not covered
by the NCVIA. These statements must be used in public health clinics and other set-
tings where federally purchased vaccines are used. Copies can be obtained from state
health authorities responsible for immunization. The use of similar statements in the
private sector is encouraged.
IMMUNIZATION RECORDS
Provider Records
Documentation of patient vaccinations helps ensure that persons in need of vac-
cine receive it and that adequately vaccinated patients are not overimmunized,
increasing the risk for hypersensitivity (e.g., tetanus toxoid hypersensitivity).
Serologic test results for vaccine-preventable diseases (such as those for rubella
screening) as well as documented episodes of adverse events also should be recorded
in the permanent medical record of the vaccine recipient.


## p. 29 (#253) #############################################

Vol. 43 / No. RR-1 MMWR 29
Health-care providers who administer one or more of the vaccines covered by
NVICP are required to ensure that the permanent medical record of the recipient (or a
permanent office log or file) states the date the vaccine was administered, the vaccine
manufacturer, the vaccine lot number, and the name, address, and title of the person
administering the vaccine. The term health-care provider is defined as any licensed
health-care professional, organization, or institution, whether private or public (includ-
ing federal, state, and local departments and agencies), under whose authority a
specified vaccine is administered. The ACIP recommends that the above information
be kept for all vaccines and not only for those required by the National Vaccine Injury
Act.
Patient's Personal Record
Official immunization cards have been adopted by every state and the District of
Columbia to encourage uniformity of records and to facilitate the assessment of
immunization status by schools and child care centers. The records are also important
tools in immunization education programs aimed at increasing parental and patient
awareness of the need for vaccines. A permanent immunization record card should be
established for each newborn infant and maintained by the parent. in many states,
these cards are distributed to new mothers before discharge from the hospital. Some
states are developing computerized immunization record systems.
Persons Without Documentation of Vaccinations
Health-care providers frequently encounter persons who have no adequate docu-
mentation of vaccinations. Although vaccinations should not be postponed if records
cannot be found, an attempt to locate missing records should be made by contacting
previous health-care providers. If records cannot be located, such persons should be
considered susceptible and should be started on the age-appropriate immunization
schedule (Tables 4 and 5). The following guidelines are recommended:
0 MMR, OPV (or IPV, if indicated), Hib, hepatitis B, and influenza vaccines can be
administered because no adverse effects of repeated vaccination have been
demonstrated with these vaccines.
0 Persons who develop a serious adverse reaction after administration of DTP,
DTaP, DT, Td, or tetanus toxoid should be individually assessed before the ad-
ministration of further doses of these vaccines (see the ACIP recommendations
for use of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines) (14,83,84 ).
0 Pneumococcal vaccine should be administered, if indicated. In most studies,
local reactions in adults after revaccination were similar compared with initial
vaccination (see the ACIP recommendations for the use of Pneumococcal Poly-
saccharide Vaccine for further details) (85 ).
Acceptability of Vaccinations Received Outside the United States
The acceptability of vaccines received in other countries for meeting vaccination
requirements in the United States depends on vaccine potency, adequate documenta-
tion of receipt of the vaccine, and the vaccination schedule used. Although problems
with vaccine potency have occasionally been detected (most notably with tetanus


## p. 30 (#254) #############################################

30 MMWR January 28, 1994
toxoid and OPV), the majority of vaccine used worldwide is from reliable local or inter-
national manufacturers. It is reasonable to assume that vaccine received in other
countries was of adequate potency.
Thus, the acceptability of vaccinations received outside the United States depends
primarily on whether receipt of the vaccine was adequately documented and whether
the immunization schedule li.e., age at vaccination and spacing of vaccine doses) was
comparable with that recommended in the United States (Tables 3—5,10). The follow-
ing recommendations are derived from current immunization guidelines in the United

recommended routine and accelerated vaccination schedules.
fDTaP can be used in place of the fourth (and fifth) dose of DTP for children who are at least
15 months of age. Children who have received all four primary vaccination doses before
their fourth birthday should receive a fifth dose of DTP (DT) or DTaP at 4-6 years of age
before entering kindergarten or elementary school and at least 6 months after the fourth
dose. The total number of doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids should not exceed six
each before the seventh birthday (14 ).
§The American Academy of Pediatrics permits DTP and OPV to be administered as early as
4 weeks of age in areas with high endemicity and during outbreaks.
‘The booster dose of Hib vaccine which is recommended following the primary vaccination
series should be administered no earlier than 12 months of age and at least 2 months after
the previous dose of Hib vaccine (Tables 3 and 4).
**See text to differentiate conventional inactivated poliovirus vaccine from enhanced-potency
IPV.
"For unvaccinated adults at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus with <3 months but
>2 months available before protection is needed, three doses of IPV should be administered
at least 1 month apart.
§§Although the age for measles vaccination may be as young as 6 months in outbreak areas
where cases are occurring in children <1 year of age, children initially vaccinated before
the first birthday should be revaccinated at 12-15 months of age and an additional dose of
vaccine should be administered at the time of school entry or according to local policy.
Doses of MMR or other measles-containing vaccines should be separated by at least
1 month.

States. They are based on minimum acceptable standards and may not represent op-
timal recommended ages and intervals.
Only doses of vaccine with written documentation of the date of receipt should be
accepted as valid. Self-reported doses of vaccine without written documentation
should not be accepted.
Because childhood vaccination schedules vary in different countries, the age at
vaccination and the spacing of doses may differ from that recommended in the United
States. The age at vaccination is particularly important for measles vaccine. In most
developing countries, measles vaccine is administered at 9 months of age when sero-
conversion rates are lower than at ages 12-15 months. For this reason, children
vaccinated against measles before their first birthday should be revaccinated at 12-
15 months of age and again, depending on state or local policy, upon entry to primary,
middle, or junior high school. Doses of MMR or other measles-containing vaccines
should be separated by at least 1 month. Combined MMR vaccine is preferred. Chil-
dren who received monovalent measles vaccine rather than MMR on or aftertheir first
birthday also should receive a primary dose of mumps and rubella vaccines.
In most countries, including the United States, the first of three regularly scheduled
doses of OPV is administered at 6 weeks of age at the same time as DTP vaccine.
However, in polio-endemic countries, an extra dose of OPV is often administered at
birth or at 32 weeks of age. For acceptability in the United States, doses of OPV and
IPV administered at 26 weeks (42 days) of age can be counted as a valid part of the
vaccination series. For the primary vaccination series, each of the three doses of OPV
should have been separated by a minimum of 6 weeks (42 days). If enhanced-potency
IPV (available in the United States beginning in 1988) was received, the first two doses
should have been separated by at least 4 weeks with at least 6 months between the
second and third dose. If conventional inactivated poliovirus vaccine (available in the
United States until 1988 and still used routinely in some countries leg, the Nether-
lands]) was used for the primary series, the first three doses should have been
separated by at least 4 weeks with at least 6 months between the third and fourth
dose. If both OPV and an inactivated poliovirus vaccine were received, the primary
vaccination series should consist of a combined total of four doses of polio vaccine,
unless the use of enhanced potency IPV can be verified. If OPV and enhanced-potency
IPV were received, the primary series consists of a combined total of three doses of
polio vaccine. Any dose of polio vaccine administered at the above recommended
minimum intervals can be considered valid. Because the recommended polio vaccina-
tion schedule in many countries differs from that used in the United States, persons
vaccinated outside the United States may need one or more additional doses of OPV
(or enhanced-potency IPV) to meet current immunization guidelines in the United
States.
Any dose of DTP vaccine or Hib vaccine administered at 26 weeks of age can be
considered valid. The "booster" dose of Hib vaccine should not have been adminis-
tered before age 12 months. The first three doses of DTP vaccine should have been
separated by a minimum of 4 weeks, and the fourth dose should have been adminis-
tered no less than 6 months after the third dose. Doses of Hib vaccine in the primary
series should have been administered no less than 1 month apart. The booster dose
of Hib vaccine should have been administered at least 2 months after the previous
dose.

The first dose of hepatitis B vaccine can be administered as early as at birth and
should have been separated from the second dose by at least 1 month. The final (third
or fourth) dose should have been administered no sooner than 4 months of age and at
least 2 months after the previous dose, although an interval of at least 4 months is
preferable.
Any dose of vaccine administered at the recommended minimum intervals can be
considered valid. Intervals longer than those recommended do not affect antibody
titers and may be counted.
Immunization requirements for school entry vary by state. Specific state require-
ments should be consulted if vaccinations have been administered by schedules
substantially different from those routinely recommended in the United States.
VACCINE PROGRAMS
The best way to reduce vaccine-preventable diseases is to have a highly immune
population. Universal immunization is an important part of good health care and
should be accomplished through routine and intensive programs carried out in physi-
cians’ offices and in public-health clinics. Programs should be established and
maintained in all communities with the goal to ensure vaccination of all children at the
recommended age. In addition, appropriate vaccinations should be available for all
adults.
Providers should strive to adhere to the Standards for Pediatric Immunization Prac-
tices (74 ). These Standards define appropriate immunization practices for both the
public and private sectors. The Standards provide guidance on how to make immuni-
zation services more conducive to the needs of children through implementation of
practices which will result in eliminating barriers to vaccination. These include
practices aimed at eliminating unnecessary prerequisites for receiving vaccines, elimi-
nating missed opportunities to vaccinate, improving procedures to assess a child's
need for vaccines, enhancing knowledge about vaccinations among both parents and
providers, and improving the management and reporting of adverse events. In addi-
tion, the Standards address the importance of tracking systems and the use of audits
to monitor clinic-office immunization coverage levels among clients. The Standards
are the goal to which all providers should strive to attain appropriate vaccination of all
children.
Standards of practice have also been published to increase vaccination levels
among adults (86). All adults should complete a primary series of tetanus and diph-
theria toxoids and receive a booster dose every 10 years. Persons 265 years of age and
all adults with medical conditions that place them at risk for pneumococcal disease or
serious complications of influenza should receive pneumococcal polysaccharide vac-
cine and annual injections of influenza vaccine. Adult immunization programs should
also provide MMR vaccine whenever possible to anyone susceptible to measles,
mumps, or rubella. Persons born after 1956 who are attending college (or other post-
high school educational institutions), who are newly employed in situations that place
them at high risk for measles transmission (e.g., health-care facilities), or who are trav-
eling to areas with endemic measles, should have documentation of having received
two doses of live MMR on or after their first birthday or other evidence of immunity.
All other young adults in this age group should have documentation of a single dose

of live MMR vaccine on or after their first birthday or have other evidence of immunity.
Use of MMR causes no harm if the vaccinee is already immune to one or more of its
components and its use ensures that the vaccinee has been immunized against three
different diseases. In addition, widespread use of hepatitis B vaccine is encouraged for
all persons who are or may be at increased risk (e.g., adolescents and adults who are
either in a high-risk group or reside in areas with high rates‘ of injecting drug use,
teenage pregnancy, and-or sexually transmitted disease).
Every visit to a health-care provider is an opportunity to update a patient's immuni-
zation status with needed vaccines. Official health agencies should take necessary
steps, including developing and enforcing school immunization requirements, to as-
sure that students at all grade levels (including college students) and those in child
care centers are protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. Agencies should
also encourage institutions such as hospitals and long-term-care facilities to adopt
policies regarding the appropriate vaccination of patients, residents, and employees.
Dates of vaccination (day, month, and year) should be recorded on institutional
immunization records, such as those kept in schools and child care centers. This will
facilitate assessments that a primary vaccine series has been completed according to
an appropriate schedule and that needed boosters have been obtained at the correct
time.
The ACIP recommends the use of "tickler" or recall systems by all health-care
providers. Such systems should also be used by health-care providers who treat
adults to ensure that at-risk persons receive influenza vaccine annually and that other
vaccinations, such as Td, are administered as needed.
REPORTING VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES
Public health officials depend on the prompt reporting of vaccine-preventable
diseases to local or state health departments by health-care providers to effectively
monitor the occurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases for prevention and control
efforts.
Nearly all vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States are notifiable; individ-
ual cases should be reported to local or state health departments. State health
departments report these diseases each week to CDC. The local and state health de-
partments and CDC use these surveillance data to determine whether outbreaks or
other unusual events are occurring and to evaluate prevention and control strategies.
In addition, CDC uses these data to evaluate the impact of national policies, practices,
and strategies for vaccine programs.
SOURCES OF VACCINE INFORMATION
In addition to these general recommendations, other sources are available that
contain specific and updated vaccine information. These sources include the
following:
Official vaccine package circulars. Manufacturer-provided product-specific infor-
mation approved by the FDA with each vaccine. Some of these materials are
reproduced in the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR).

Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP): Use of Vaccines and Immune
Globulins for Persons with Altered Immunocompetence
INTRODUCTION
This statement summarizes current recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immuniza-
tion Practices (ACIP) on the use of active and passive immunization for persons with altered
Immunocompetence. The purpose of this statement is to make ACIP recommendations more acces-
sible for clinicians by consolidating them into a single document. ACIP statements on individual
vaccines or immune globulins should be consulted for more details on safety and efficacy and on the
epidemiology of the diseases. Recommendations on immunization following bone marrow trans-
plantation will be published in a separate ACIP statement.
These recommendations are for use in the United States and its territories and are appropriate for
the epidemiologic setting and program priorities of these areas. Other organizations, particularly the
Expanded Programme on Immunization of the World Health Organization, have made different rec-
ommendations, particularly with respect to the use of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and Bacille
Calmette-Guerin (BCG) for immunocompromised persons. Those recommendations are appropriate
for populations, particularly in developing countries, with higher risks of exposure to wild poliovirus
infection and tuberculosis.
This statement is divided into four sections. The first is a brief summary of principles for vaccinat-
ing immunocompromised persons. The second section discusses how specific immuno-
compromising conditions may alter recommendations for vaccination. The third section discusses
each vaccine and how recommendations for use may be altered in immunocompromised persons.
The final section contains summary tables on the use of vaccines and immune globulins, arranged
by immunocompromising condition.
SUMMARY OF PRINCIPLES FOR VACCINATING
IMMUNOCOMPROMISED PERSONS
The degree to which an individual patient is immunocompromised should be determined by a
physician. Severe immunosuppression can be due to a variety of conditions, including congenital
immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, leukemia, lymphoma, general-
ized malignancy or therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large amounts of
corticosteroids. For some of these conditions, all affected persons will be severely immunocom-
promised; for others, such as HIV infection, the spectrum of disease severity due to disease or
treatment stage will determine the degree to which the immune system is compromised. The re-
sponsibility for determining whether a patient is severely immunocompromised ultimately lies with
the physician.
Killed or inactivated vaccines do not represent a danger to immunocompromised persons and
generally should be administered as recommended for healthy-persons. For specific immunocom-
promising conditions (e.g., asplenia), such patients may be at higher risk for certain diseases, and
additional vaccines, particularly bacterial polysaccharide vaccines [Haemophilus influenzae type b
(Hib), pneumococcal and meningococcal], are recommended for them. Frequently, the immune re-
sponse of immunocompromised persons to these vaccine antigens is not as good as that of
immunocompetent persons; higher doses or more frequent boosters may be required, although
even with these modifications, the immune response may be suboptimal.
Steroid therapy usually does not contraindicate administration of live-virus vaccines when such
therapy is short term (<2 weeks); low to moderate dose; long-term, alternate-day treatment with
short-acting preparations; maintenance physiologic doses (replacement therapy); or administered
topically (skin or eyes), by aerosol, or by infra-articular, bursal, or tendon injection. The exact amount


## p. 46 (#270) #############################################

of systemic corticosteroids and the duration of their administration needed to suppress the immune
system of an otherwise healthy child are not well defined. The immunosuppressive effects of steroid
treatment vary, but many clinicians consider a dose equivalent to either 2 mg-kg of body weight or a
total of 20 mg-day of prednisone as sufficiently immunosuppressive to raise concern about the safety
of immunization with live-virus vaccines. Corticosteroids used in greater than physiologic doses also
may reduce the immune response to vaccines. Physicians should wait at least 3 months after discon-
tinuation of therapy before administering a live-virus vaccine to patients who have received
high-dose, systemic steroids for 22 weeks.
SPECIFIC IMMUNOCOMPROMISING CONDITIONS
For practical considerations, persons with immunocompromising conditions may be divided into
three groups:
A. Persons who are severely immunocompromised not as a result of HIV infection;
B. Persons with HIV infection; and
C. Persons with conditions that cause limited immune deficits (e.g., asplenia, renal failure) that
may require use of special vaccines or higher doses of vaccines but that do not contraindicate
use of any particular vaccine.
These groups differ primarily in the recommendations for use of live-virus vaccines, which are
contraindicated for all persons in group A, for some vaccines and some persons in group B, and are
not contraindicated in group C.
A. Severely immunocompromised, Non-HIV-lnfected Persons
Severe immunosuppression not associated with HIV can be the result of congenital immunodefi-
ciency, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy or therapy with alkylating agents,
antimetabolites, radiation, or large amounts of corticosteroids (1-3 ). Virus replication after admini-
stration of live, attenuated-virus vaccines can be enhanced in severely immunocompromised
persons (4-6). In general, these patients should not be administered live vaccines, with the excep-
tions noted below. In addition, OPV should not be administered to any household contact of a
severely immunocompromised person. Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is not contraindi-
cated for the close contacts (including health-care providers) of immunocompromised persons.
Persons with leukemia in remission who have not received chemotherapy for at least 3 months
are not considered severely immunosuppressed for the purpose of receiving live-virus vaccines (7).
When cancer chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy is being considered (e.g., for patients
with Hodgkin's disease or organ transplantation), vaccination ideally should precede the initiation of
chemotherapy or immunosuppression by 22 weeks. Vaccination during chemotherapy or radiation
therapy should be avoided because antibody responses are suboptimal. Patients vaccinated while on
immunosuppressive therapy or in the 2 weeks before starting therapy should be considered unim-
munized and should be revaccinated at least 3 months after discontinuation of therapy.
Passive immunoprophylaxis with immune globulins may be indicated for immunocompromised
persons instead of or in addition to vaccination (see discussion under use of immune globulins).
When exposed to a vaccine-preventable disease such as measles, severely immunocompromised
children should be considered susceptible regardless of their history of vaccination.
B. HIV-Infected Persons
In general, persons known to be HIV infected should not receive live-virus or live-bacteria vac-
cines. However, evaluation and testing for HIV infection of asymptomatic persons are not necessary
before decisions concerning vaccination with live-virus vaccines are made. Limited studies of MMR
vaccination among both asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV-infected patients have not documented
serious or unusual adverse events (see discussion under MMR vaccine) (8). Therefore, MMR vacci-
nation is recommended for all children and for adults when otherwise indicated, regardless of their
HIV status. Enhanced inactivated polio vaccine (elPV) is the preferred polio vaccine for persons


## p. 47 (#271) #############################################

known to have HIV infection. Pneumococcal vaccine is indicated for all HIV-infected persons 22 years
of age. Children <2 years of age with known HIV infection should receive Hib vaccine according to the
routine schedule. Clinicians deciding whether to administer Hib vaccine to HIV-infected persons
should take into consideration the individual patient’s risk of Hib disease and the effectiveness of the
vaccine for these persons. In some settings, the incidence of Hib disease may be higher among HIV-
infected adults than non-HlV-infected adults (9,10), and the disease can be severe in these patients.
In general, symptomatic HIV-infected children and adults have suboptimal immunologic re-
sponses to vaccines (8,11-15). The response to both live and killed antigens may decrease as the HIV
disease progresses (8). However, the response to higher doses of vaccine and the persistence of
antibody in HIV-infected patients have not been systematically evaluated. Although higher doses or
more frequent boosters may be considered for these patients, firm recommendations cannot be
made at this time.
C. Medical Conditions Associated Only with Special Indications for Vaccines
Certain medical conditions, such as renal failure, diabetes, alcoholic cirrhosis, or asplenia, may
increase the patient’s risk for certain diseases. Some antigens, particularly bacterial polysaccharide
vaccines, are recommended for such patients. Frequently, the immune response of these patients to
these antigens is not as good as that of immunocompetent persons, and higher doses or more fre-
quent boosters may be required. Persons with these conditions are generally not considered
immunosuppressed for the purposes of vaccination and should receive routine vaccinations with
both live and inactivated vaccines according to the usual schedules.
Renal Failure
Patients with renal failure have an increased risk of infection with a variety of pathogens, particu-
larly pneumococcus and hepatitis B (16—19). The efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination for some of
these patients, including those on dialysis, may be considerably lower than for immunocompetent
patients (20,21 ), their antibody levels may be lower (22 ), and they may require repeat vaccination
(23,24) or an increased dose of vaccine. Because secondary antibody responses are less affected
than primary antibody responses, immunization strategies should be formulated early in the course
of progressive renal disease. This approach is particularly important if transplantation and chronic
immunosuppressive therapy are being considered. Nephrotic syndrome is the renal disease most
clearly associated with an increased risk for pneumococcal infection. See the discussion under Influ-
enza and Hepatitis B vaccine for recommendations on the use of those antigens.
Diabetes
Although several in vitro tests of immunologic function are known to be abnormal among dia-
betic patients, these defects may be of little clinical importance. However, because patients with
longstanding diabetes mellitus often have cardiovascular, renal, and other end-organ dysfunction,
one-time pneumococcal vaccination and annual influenza vaccination are recommended. Pneumo-
coccal vaccine is safe and effective for these patients and does not interfere with insulin levels or
glucose control (25,26 ). Patients receiving either insulin or oral antidiabetic agents respond normally
to influenza vaccination without impairment of diabetic control (27 ).
Alcoholic Cirrhosis
Patients with alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease have an increased incidence of infections,
especially pneumonia. Such patients have many defects in host defenses, although the clinical im-
portance of any one defect as measured in the laboratory is often uncertain. Many of these patients
have leukopenia, decreased complement activity, chemotactic defects, and impaired cell-mediated
immunity. In cirrhotic patients, portosystemic shunting can diminish the clearance of bacteria and
increase the severity of infection. Patients with alcoholism or alcoholic liver disease should receive
one-time pneumococcal and yearly influenza vaccination.


## p. 48 (#272) #############################################

Asplenia
Persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia have an increased risk for fulminant bactere-
mia, associated with a high mortality rate. Polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for all
asplenic persons 22 years of age. In some instances, reimmunization with pneumococcal vaccine is
indicated (see discussion under Pneumococcal vaccine). Quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccha-
ride vaccine also should be administered to asplenic children 22 years of age. Immunization with Hib
vaccine should be initiated in infancy at the same dosage and schedule as recommended for other-
wise healthy children. Hib vaccines are immunogenic in splenectomized adults and may be
considered for this group. When elective splenectomy is planned, vaccination with pneumococcal,
meningococcal, and Hib vaccines should precede surgery by at least 2 weeks, if possible.
SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS FOR USE OF VACCINES
Live, Attenuated Vaccines
MeasIes-Mumps-Rubella (MMR/MR/M/R) Vaccine
MMR vaccine should not be administered to severely immunocompromised persons. For HIV-in-
fected children, MMR should routinely be administered at 15 months of age. MMR should be
considered for all symptomatic HIV-infected persons who would otherwise be eligible for measles
vaccine, since measles can affect these patients severely (28). Evaluation and testing for HIV infec-
tion of asymptomatic children are not necessary before decisions concerning immunization with
live-virus vaccines are made. Limited studies of MMR vaccination among both asymptomatic and
symptomatic HIV-infected patients have not documented serious or unusual adverse events (8). If
there is risk of exposure to measles, single-antigen measles vaccine should be administered at 6-11
months of age with a second dose (of MMR) at >12 months of age. Severely immunocompromised
patients and symptomatic HIV-infected patients who are exposed to measles should receive immune
globulin (IG), regardless of prior vaccination status. The recommended dose of (G for measles pro-
phylaxis of immunocompromised persons is 0.5 mL/kg of body weight (maximum dose, 15 mL). The
immunogenicity of measles vaccine is decreased if vaccine is administered <6 months after IG.
Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)
OPV should not be used to immunize immunocompromised patients, their household contacts, or
nursing personnel in close contact with such patients; eIPV is recommended for such persons. lmmu-
nocompromised patients may be unable to limit replication of vaccine virus effectively, and
administration of OPV to children with congenital immunodeficiency has resulted in severe, progres-
sive neurologic involvement (29-32 ). Although a protective immune response to eIPV in the
immunocompromised patient cannot be assured, the vaccine is safe and may confer some protec-
tion. If OPV is inadvertently administered to a household or intimate contact (regardless of prior
immunization status) of an immunocompromised patient, close contact between the patient and the
recipient of OPV should be avoided for approximately 1 month after vaccination, the period of maxi-
mum excretion of vaccine virus. Because of the possibility of immunodeficiency in other children
born to a family in which there has been one such case, OPV should not be administered to a mem-
ber of a household in which there is a history of inherited immunodeficiency until the immune status
of the recipient and other children in the family is documented. Although OPV has not been harmful
when administered to asymptomatic HIV-infected children (8), eIPV is the vaccine of choice for a
child who is known to be infected. Evaluation and testing for HIV infection of asymptomatic children
are not necessary before decisions concerning immunization with live-virus vaccines are made.
BCG
BCG vaccine is not routinely recommended for use in the United States for prevention of tubercu-
losis (TB). BCG vaccine is strongly recommended for infants and children with negative tuberculin


## p. 49 (#273) #############################################

skin tests who are a) at high risk of intimate and prolonged exposure to persistently untreated or
ineffectively treated patients with infectious pulmonary TB, cannot be removed from the source of
exposure, and cannot be placed on long-term preventive therapy; or b) continuously exposed to
persons with TB who have bacilli resistant to isoniazid and rifampin. BCG is also recommended for
tuberculin-negative infants and children in groups in which the rate of new infections exceeds 1% per
year and for whom the usual surveillance and treatment programs have been attempted but are not
operationally feasible.
BCG should be administered with caution to persons in groups at high risk for HIV infection or
persons known to be severely immunocompromised. Although limited data suggest that the vaccine
may be safe for use for asymptomatic children infected with HIV (33 ), BCG vaccination is not recom-
mended for HIV-infected adults or for persons with symptomatic disease (34-36). Until further
research can clearly define the risks and benefits of BCG vaccination for this population, vaccination
should be restricted to persons at exceptionally high risk for tuberculosis infection. HIV-infected per-
sons thought to be infected with M. tuberculosis should be strongly recommended for tuberculosis
preventive therapy.
Typhoid Vaccine
Live, attenuated TY21a typhoid vaccine should not be administered to immunocompromised per-
sons, including those known to be infected with HIV. Parenteral inactivated vaccine is a theoretically
safer alternative for this group.
Yellow Fever Vaccine
Yellow fever vaccine virus poses a theoretical risk of encephalitis to those with severe immuno-
suppression or known HIV infection, and such patients should not receive the vaccine. If travel to an
area endemic for yellow fever is necessary, patients should be advised of the risk, instructed in meth-
ods for avoiding vector mosquitos, and supplied with vaccination waiver letters by their physicians.
Persons who are known to be HIV infected and who cannot avoid potential exposure to yellow fever
virus should be offered the choice of vaccination. Vaccinees should be monitored for possible ad-
verse effects. Since the vaccination of such persons may be less effective than that for
non-HIV-infected persons, it may be desirable to measure their neutralizing antibody responses be-
fore travel. (For these tests, contact the appropriate state health department or CDC [303-221-6400]).
Family members of immunosuppressed persons who themselves have no contraindications may
receive yellow fever vaccine.
Vaccinia
The only persons for whom vaccinia vaccine is recommended are laboratory personnel working
with orthopox viruses and certain health-care workers involved in clinical trials of vaccinia recombi-
nant vaccines. Vaccinia should not be administered to severely immunocompromised persons or
those with symptomatic HIV infection. Disseminated vaccinia has been reported in a military recruit
with HIV infection (37).
Killed or Inactivated Vaccines
Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP/DTaP/DT/Td)
For children who are severely immunocompromised or who are infected with HIV, DTP vaccine is
indicated in the same schedule and dose as for immunocompetent children, including the use of
acellular pertussis-containing vaccines (DTaP) as a booster. Although no specific studies with pertus-
sis vaccine are available, if immunosuppressive therapy is to be discontinued shortly it would be
reasonable to defer immunization until at least 3 months after the patient last received therapy; 0th-
erwise, the patient should be vaccinated while still receiving therapy.


## p. 50 (#274) #############################################

Enhanced lnactivated Polio Vaccine (elPV)
If polio immunization is indicated, immunocompromised infants, their household members, nurs-
ing personnel in close contact, and other close contacts should receive elPV rather than OPV. (See the
discussion under OPV.) For unvaccinated adults at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus, a primary
series of enhanced-potency elPV is recommended. This recommendation applies to both immu-
nologically normal and immunocompromised adults.
Haemophilus influenzae b Conjugate Vaccine (Hib)
immunocompromised children should receive Hib conjugate vaccines in the same dosage and
schedule as for immunocompetent children. Unimmunized children 25 years of age with a chronic
illness known to be associated with increased risk of Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, specifi-
cally, persons with anatomic or functional asplenia or sickle-cell anemia or those who have
undergone splenectomy, should receive Hib vaccine. One dose may be insufficient to induce immu-
nity in children >5 years of age with sickle cell disease, but the data are insufficient to recommend
whether persons suffering from this or other immunosuppressive disorders should receive more
than one dose. Clinicians deciding whether to administer Hib vaccine to HIV-infected persons should
take into consideration the individual patient's risk of Hib disease and the effectiveness of the vaccine
for these persons. In some settings, the incidence of Hib disease may be higher among HIV-infected
adults than non-HlV-infected adults (9,10), and the disease can be severe in these patients. Patients
with Hodgkin's disease should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before the initiation of chemotherapy
or, if this is not possible, 23 months after the end of chemotherapy. Hib vaccine can be administered
simultaneously with pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccine in separate syringes at different sites.
Influenza Vaccine
Because influenza may result in serious illness and complications for immunocompromised per-
sons, vaccination is recommended and may result in protective antibody levels in many
immunocompromised recipients (38). Influenza vaccine is recommended for children with sympto-
matic HIV infection. However, the antibody response to vaccine may be low in persons with
advanced HIV-related illnesses; a booster dose of vaccine has not been shown to improve the im-
mune response for these persons (39 ). There is currently little information regarding the frequency
and severity of influenza illness in HIV-infected persons (40 ).
Patients with chronic renal failure should receive annual influenza immunization. Uremic patients
on chronic hemodialysis may often have an impaired but adequate antibody response to influenza
vaccination (41-43 ). Antibody response in renal transplant patients after influenza immunization is
lower in those receiving cyclosporine A than in those on azathioprine (44,45). Amantadine prophy-
laxis or treatment also should be considered during periods of increased type A influenza activity in
the community. However, strict attention must be given to administering reduced doses of aman-
tadine to patients with renal failure.
Pneumococcal Vaccine
Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for use in persons 22 years of age with chronic illnesses
specifically associated with increased risk of pneumococcal disease or its complications (e.g.,
anatomic or functional asplenia [including sickle cell disease], nephrotic syndrome, cerebrospinal
fluid leaks, and conditions associated with immunosuppression, including HIV infection) (46 ). Revac-
cination after 3—5 years should be considered for children with nephrotic syndrome, asplenia, or
sickle cell anemia who would be $10 years old at revaccination.
Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for use in immunocompetent adults who are at increased
risk of pneumococcal disease or its complications because of chronic illness (e.g., cardiovascular
disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, cirrhosis, or cerebrospinal fluid leaks).
Vaccination is also recommended for immunocompromised adults at increased risk of pneumococ-
cal disease or its complications (e.g., persons with splenic dysfunction or anatomic asplenia,
Hodgkin's disease, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syn-

drome, or conditions such as organ transplantation associated with lmmunosuppression). Revacci-
nation should be strongly considered 26 years after the first dose for those patients at highest risk of
fatal pneumococcal infection (e.g., asplenic patients) or for those at highest risk of rapid decline in
antibody levels (e.g., those with chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, or transplanted organs).
Hepatitis B Vaccine
Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for susceptible hemodialysis patients. Although serore-
sponse to hepatitis B vaccine is lower in hemodialysis patients than in healthy persons, for those
patients who do respond, hepatitis B vaccine will protect them from hepatitis B virus infection and
reduce the necessity for frequent serologic screening (47). Hepatitis B vaccine is also indicated for
patients whose renal disease is likely to lead to dialysis or transplantation. Such patients are at in-
creased risk for hepatitis B because of their need for blood products and hemodialysis. Patients with
uremia who were vaccinated before they required dialysis have been shown to have higher serocon-
version rates and antibody titers (48 ). The response may also be better in children (49 ). In addition,
periodic booster doses are usually necessary following successful immunization, with their timing
determined by serologic testing at 12-month intervals.
For patients undergoing hemodialysis and for other immunosuppressed patients, higher vaccine
doses or increased number of doses are required. A special formulation of one vaccine is now avail-
able for such persons (Recombivax HB, 40 ug/mL). Persons with HIV infection have an impaired
response to hepatitis B vaccine. The immunogenicity of higher doses of vaccine is unknown for this
group, and firm recommendations on dosage cannot be made at this time (50). The anti-Hbs re-
sponse of such persons should be tested after they are vaccinated, and those who have not
responded should be revaccinated with 1-3 additional doses.
Meningococcal Vaccine
Routine immunization with the quadrivalent vaccine is recommended for certain high-risk groups,
including persons with terminal complement component deficiencies and those with anatomic or
functional asplenia. Persons splenectomized because of trauma or nonlymphoid tumors and those
with inherited complement deficiencies have acceptable antibody responses to meningococcal vac-
cine, although its clinical efficacy has not been documented in these patients.
Rabies Vaccine
Corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive agents, and immunosuppressive illnesses can inter-
fere with the development of active immunity and predispose the patient to developing rabies if
exposed. immunosuppressive agents should not be administered during postexposure therapy, un-
less essential for the treatment of other conditions. When rabies postexposure prophylaxis is
administered to persons receiving steroids or other immunosuppressive therapy, it is especially im-
portant that serum be tested for rabies antibody to ensure that an adequate response has developed.
Other Killed Antigens
Other vaccines containing killed antigens, including cholera, plague, and anthrax, do not pose a
risk to immunocompromised persons and should be used for the same indications as for immu-
nologically normal persons.
USE OF IMMUNE GLOBULINS
lmmunocompromised persons may benefit from protection by passive immunization. The use of
immune globulin preparations in these patients is described below.
Immune Globulin (IG)
For immunocompromised persons, IG is indicated to prevent measles following exposure. If im-
mediate protection against measles is required for immunocompromised persons with


## p. 52 (#276) #############################################

contraindications to measles vaccination, including exposed infants <1 year of age, passive immuni-
zation with 16, 0.5 mL/kg of body weight (maximum dose = 15 mL), should be administered
intramuscularly as soon as possible after exposure. Exposed symptomatic HIV-infected and other
severely immunocompromised persons should receive lG regardless of their previous vaccination
status, because measles vaccine may not be effective in such patients and the disease may be se-
vere. For immunocompromised persons, the recommended dose is 0.5 mL/kg of body weight if 16 is
administered intramuscularly (maximum dose = 15 mL). This corresponds to a dose of protein of
approximately 82.5 mg-kg (maximum dose = 2,475 mg). Intramuscular 16 may not be necessary if a
patient with HIV infection is receiving 100-400 mg-kg IGIV at regular intervals and the last dose was
administered within 3 weeks of exposure to measles. Because the amounts of protein administered
are similar, high-dose IGIV may be as effective as IG administered intramuscularly. However, no data
are available concerning the effectiveness of IGIV in preventing measles.
For immunocompromised persons receiving 16 for measles prophylaxis (0.50 mL/kg [82 mg-kg]
intramuscularly), measles vaccination should be delayed for 6 months following 16 administration.
For persons receiving IG for replacement of humoral immune deficiencies (320 mg-kg intravenously),
measles vaccination should be delayed until 8 months following 16 administration.
For the prevention of hepatitis A, 16 should be administered in the same dose and schedule to
both immunocompromised and immunocompetent persons.
Varicella-zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG)
The most important use of VZIG is for passive immunization of neonates and susceptible, severely
immunocompromised persons after significant exposure to chickenpox or zoster. (Significant expo-
sure to a person with varicella is defined to include household contact, close contact indoors of
>1 hour, sharing the same two- to four-bed hospital room, or prolonged direct, face-to-face contact
such as occurs with nurses or doctors who care for the patient [51].) immunocompromised patients
who are exposed to varicella and receive VZIG may have lower rates of complications and infections.
Varicella-susceptible pregnant women may be at higher risk for serious complications than are adults
in general. Of especial concern is the risk to the fetus when a woman develops varicella-zoster infec-
tion during the first half of pregnancy. Whether the fetus will be protected against development of
malformations if VZIG is administered to a pregnant, susceptible woman after exposure is unknown.
When deciding to administer VZIG to an immunocompromised patient, the clinician must deter-
mine whether the patient is likely to be susceptible and whether the exposure is likely to result in
infection. The risks of VZIG administration appear to be negligible, but the costs of administration
can be substantial. A physician should carefully evaluate the susceptibility of patients to varicella
before administering VZIG. Both immunocompetent and immunocompromised adults and children
who are believed to have had varicella on the basis of a carefully obtained history by an experienced
interviewer can be considered immune. Laboratory determination of susceptibility to varicella is
often impractical. Modern antibody assays may detect either nonspecific antibody or antibody levels
that may not be protective.
Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG)
immunocompromised persons should receive HBIG for the same indications (perinatal, needle-
stick, or sexual exposure to a person positive for hepatitis B surface antigen) and in the same doses
as immunocompetent persons. The HB vaccine series should be started concurrently with HBIG
treatment.
Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG), Tetanus Immune Globulin (TIG), and Human Rabies
Immune Globulin (HRIG)
immunocompromised persons should receive VIG, TIG, and HRIG for the same indications and in
the same doses as immunocompetent persons.

ORGANIZATION OF THE SUMMARY TABLES


The following tables summarize recommendations for vaccine use in immuno-
compromised persons. A "Recommended" entry denotes that the vaccine is
either recommended as part of the routine schedule or the medical condition rep-
resents an indication for use of the vaccine. A "Use if Indicated" entry in the table
denotes that the category of immunosuppression is not a contraindication to the
use of the vaccine if otherwise indicated. A "Contraindicated" entry denotes that
the medical condition represents either an absolute or relative contraindication to
the use of the vaccine. A "Considered" entry indicates that the decision to use the
vaccine should include consideration of the individual patient’s risk of disease and
the likely effectiveness of the vaccine. See section on "Principles for vaccinating
immunocompromised persons" for a discussion of categories of immunosup-
pression.

Current Trends
Reported Vaccine-Preventable Diseases —-
Un'rted States, 1993,
and the Childhood Immunization Initiative
In the United States, children are'routinely vaccinated against nine diseases-
diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), hepatitis B, measles, mumps, per-
tussis, poliomyelitis (paralytic), rubella, and tetanus (1). Based on public health
surveillance and epidemiologic assessment of most of these diseases, the impact of
childhood vaccination on reported occurrence has been substantial (2,3 ): provisional
surveillance data for 1993 indicate that for ﬁve of these diseases and for congenital
rubella syndrome (CRS), the number of reported cases is at or near the lowest levels
ever, suggesting near interruption of transmission of these diseases. This report pre-
sents provisional data for December 1993 for these 10 diseases, compares provisional
data for 1993 with final data for 1992, and describes the Childhood Immunization
Initiative (Cll).
In December 1993, state health departments reported no cases of CR8, diphtheria,
or poliomyelitis, and fewer than ﬁve cases each of measles and tetanus (Table 1). In
addition, no cases of indigenously acquired measles were reported that could not be
linked to chains of transmission from known imported cases during September-
December, the longest such period since surveillance began in 1912.
Provisional data for 1993 indicate that the numbers of reported cases of CR8, diph-
theria, measles, poliomyelitis, rubella, and tetanus were at or near the lowest levels
ever (Table 1). Marked differences were observed in the age-specific incidence of inva-
sive H. influenzae disease,‘ acute hepatitis B, mumps, and pertussis; the number of
persons with reported cases for whom age was known was 1211, 11,633, 1515, and
5793, respectively. For invasive H. influenzae disease, preschool-aged (aged <5 years)
children constituted 399 (33%) cases; for acute hepatitis B, 142 (1%*); for mumps,
275 (18%); and for pertussis, 3753 (65%). Of preschool-aged children with pertussis,
2549 (68%) were aged <1 year (4 ).
Reported by: National Immunization Program, CDC.
Editorial Note: The findings in this report indicate that the incidences of most vaccine-
preventable diseases during 1993 were at or near their lowest reported levels.
‘ H. influenzae serotype is not routinely reported to the National Notiﬁable Diseases Surveillance
System.
tBecause most hepatitis B virus infections among infants and children aged <5 years are
asymptomatic (although more likely to become chronic), acute disease surveillance does not
reflect the incidence of this problem in this age group or the effectiveness of hepatitis B vac-
cination in infants.


## p. 187 (#296) ############################################

However, decreases in disease burden and mortality can be sustained only by achiev-
ing and maintaining high vaccination levels among children aged O-2 years. For
example, although the incidence of measles was low during 1981-1988, during 1989-
1991, a resurgence of measles-attributed primarily to a failure to vaccinate
preschool-aged children on time (i.e., early during the second year of life) (5)—
accounted for an estimated 55,000 measles cases, 11,000 hospitalizations, and
130 deaths (CDC, unpublished data, 1993).
The national response to the resurgence of measles has improved vaccination cov-
erage among children aged 0-2 years. However, because no system has been fully
established to ensure that all children complete the recommended series of 11-
15 doses of vaccine by their second birthday, vaccination coverage remains unaccept-
ably low in many areas of the United States (1,6 ). In 1993, the President initiated Cll, a
more comprehensive national response to undervaccination. The goals of Cll are to
1) eliminate indigenous cases of six vaccine-preventable diseases (i.e., diphtheria, Hib
disease [among children aged <5 years], measles, poliomyelitis, rubella, and tetanus
[among children aged <15 years] by 1996§; 2) increase vaccination coverage levels to
at least 90% among 2-year-old children by 1996 for each of the vaccinations recom-
mended routinely for children (for hepatitis B, the objective is set for 1998) (Table 2);
and 3) establish a vaccination-delivery system that maintains and further improves
high coverage levels.
sObjectives to reduce cases of mumps, pertussis, and hepatitis B will be set during 1994.

Cii comprises six broad areas of activity that constitute the framework for meeting
the nation's goals for 1996 and beyond:
' Improve quality and quantity of vaccination-delivery services. State and local
health agencies will use new federal resources to hire personnel, extend clinic
hours, and encourage health-care providers to use all health-care contacts to ad-
minister needed vaccines and reduce obstacles parents encounter in obtaining
vaccinations for children (7). Computerized state vaccination information sys-
tems are being developed to remind parents when vaccinations are due and to
assist health-care providers in determining the vaccination needs of patients.
a Increase community participation and education. A long-term, national outreach
campaign will be initiated in April 1994 to improve parent awareness of the need
for timely childhood vaccination and to prompt health-care providers to use all
health-care contacts to administer needed vaccines to children. At the national
level, elements of this campaign will include widespread distribution of radio,
television, and print public service announcements; dissemination of a national
theme and call to action; and other activities designed to unify efforts throughout
the country. At the state and community levels, the campaign will include a grass
roots organizing effort to unite all sectors of the community (e.g. public and pri-
vate health-care providers, business groups, community leaders, minority
groups, voluntary and service organizations, religious institutions, and media
affiliates).
0 Reduce vaccine cost for parents. To reduce vaccine cost as a barrier to vaccina-
tion, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will initiate the Vaccines
for Children program on October 1, 1994. This program will purchase vaccines
from manufacturers and provide them at no cost to participating public and pri-
vate health-care providers for use in children aged 0-18 years who are eligible for
Medicaid, are without health insurance, or are American Indian. Children with
health insurance who are served by federally qualiﬁed health centers also will be
able to receive free vaccine if their insurance does not cover vaccination. State
vaccination programs will be permitted to purchase additional vaccines at re-
duced federal contract prices.
0 improve surveillance for coverage and disease. An improved system for measur-
ing vaccination coverage at the national, state, and local levels among infants
and young children is being established to identify undervaccinated populations

and to monitor progress in achieving coverage goals. Clinic or ofﬁce-based as-
sessments are being completed to assist health-care providers in increasing
coverage among the populations they serve. Surveillance for vaccine-prevent-
able diseases will be intensified by investigating each case of disease targeted
for elimination to determine how that case might have been prevented and en-
able initiation of aggressive control measures when cases are detected.
Form and-strengthen partnerships. Many-federal agencies provide vaccinations
to children, reimburse for vaccination services, or have access—through educa-
tion, food, housing, or other assistance-to populations at high risk for
undervaccination. Similarly, many private providers and organizations vaccinate
children or otherwise serve or advocate for children. Coordination of these
efforts will be strengthened and new partnerships formed to concentrate the
efforts of these providers and organizations on improving the vaccination of
children.
Improve vaccines. Emphasis will be placed on the development and licensure of
new and safer or more effective vaccines. Existing vaccination schedules will be
simpliﬁed, and development of combination vaccines will be promoted.
To track progress toward achieving the goals of CH, CDC's National Immunization
Program is initiating in this issue of MMWR monthly publication of a table that sum-
marizes the number of cases of all diseases preventable by routine childhood
vaccination reported during the previous month and year-to-date (provisional data)
(Table 1). In addition, the table compares provisional data with ﬁnal data for the pre-
vious year and highlights the number of reported cases among children aged
<5 years-who are the primary focus of CH. Data in the table are derived from CDC's
National Notiﬁable Diseases Surveillance System.

Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practices
Preamble
Ideally, immunizations should be given as part of comprehensive child health care.
This is the ultimate goal toward which the nation must strive if all of America’s
children are to beneﬁt from the best primary disease prevention our health care
system has to offer.
Overall improvement in our primary care delivery system requires intensive effort
and will take time. However, we should not wait for changes in this system before
providing immunizations more effectively to our children. Current health care
policies and practices in all settings result in the failure to deliver vaccines on
schedule to many of our vulnerable preschool-aged children. This failure is due
primarily to barriers that impede vaccine delivery and to missed opportunities
during clinic visits. Changes in policies and practices can immediately improve
coverage. The present system should be geared to "user-friendly," family-centered,
culturally sensitive, and comprehensive primary health care that can provide
rapid, efficient, and consumer-oriented services to the users, i.e., children and
their parents. The failure to do so is evidenced by the recent resurgence of
measles and measles-related childhood mortality, which may be an omen of other
vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks.
Present childhood immunization practices must be changed if we Wish to protect
the nation’s children and immunize 90% of two-year-olds by the year 2000.
The following standards for pediatric immunization practices address these issues.
These standards are recommended for use by all health professionals in the public
and private sector who administer vaccines to or manage immunization services
for infants and children. These Standards represent the most desirable
immunization practices which health care providers should strive to achieve to the
extent possible. By adopting these Standards, providers can begin to enhance
and change their own policies and practices. It is recognized that not all providers
will have the funds necessary to fully implement the Standards immediately.
Nevertheless, those providers and programs lacking the resources to implement
the Standards fully should find them a useful tool in better delineating
immunization needs and in obtaining additional resources in the future in order to
achieve the Healthy People 2000 immunization objective.

@iscussion
Immunization services are readily available.
Immunization services should be responsive to the needs of patients. For
example, in large urban areas, public immunization clinic services should
be available daily, 8 hours per day. In smaller cities and rural areas,
clinics may operate less frequently. To be fully responsive, providers in
many locations should consider offering immunization services each working day as well
as during some off-hours (e.g., weekends, evenings, early mornings, or lunch-hours).
Immunization services should be considered for all days and at all hours that other child
health services in the same site are offered (e.g., Special Supplemental Food Program for
Women, Infants, and Children, [WIC]). Private providers who offer primary care to
infants and children should always include immunization services as a routine part of
that care.


Ready availability of immunization services also requires that the supply of vaccines be
adequate at all times.
There are no barriers or unnecessary prerequisites to
the receipt of vaccines.
Appointment-only systems often serve as barriers to immunization in
both public and private settings. Thus, immunization services should also
be available on a walk-in basis at all times for both routine and new
enrollee visits. Waiting time should be minimized and generally not exceed 30 minutes.
Furthermore, administration of needed vaccines should not be contingent on enrollment in
a well-baby program unless enrollment is immediately available. Children presenting
only for immunizations should be rapidly and efﬁciently screened without requiring other
comprehensive health services. However, children receiving immunizations in such an
"express lane" fashion and found not to have a primary care provider should be referred to
one.
Physical examinations and temperature measurements prior to immunization should not
be required if they delay or impede the timely receipt of immunizations (e.g., appoint-
ments for physical examination in some facilities may take weeks to months). A reliable
decision to vaccinate can be based exclusively on the information elicited from a parent or
guardian and on the provider’s observations and judgment about the child’s wellness at
the time of vaccination. At a minimum, children should have pre-immunization assess-




## p. 197 (#306) ############################################

ments, including a) observing the child’s general state of health, b) asking the parent or
guardian if the child is well, and c) questioning the parent or guardian about potential
contraindications (see attached table).
In public clinic settings, the administration of vaccines should not be dependent on
individual Written orders or on a referral from a primary care provider. Rather, standing
orders should be developed and implemented.

Immunization services are available free or for a
minimal fee.
In the public sector, immunizations should be free of charge. If fees must
be collected, they should be kept to a minimum. In the private sector,
charges should include the cost of the vaccine, and a reasonable
administration fee. Affordable vaccinations will limit the fragmentation of care and help
assure the immunization of the greatest number of children. Public and private providers
charging a fee to administer vaccines obtained through a consolidated federal contract
should prominently display a state approved sign indicating that no one will be denied
immunization services because of inability to pay the fee.



Providers utilize all clinical encounters to screen for
needed vaccines and, when indicated, immunize
children.


Each encounter with a health care provider, including an emergency room
visit or hospitalization, is an opportunity to screen the immunization
status and, if indicated, administer needed vaccines. Before discharge from the hospital,
children should receive immunizations for which they are eligible by age and-or health
status. The child’s regular health care provider should be informed about the
immunizations administered. Implementation of this standard minimizes the number of
missed opportunities to vaccinate.
In addition, children accompanying parents or siblings who are seeking any service should
also be screened and, when indicated, given needed vaccines.
Providers in subspecialty clinics (e.g., oncology) who care for children should pay
particular attention to the immunization status of their patients and vaccinate or refer
them to immunization services or primary health care providers as appropriate.


## p. 198 (#307) ############################################

Providers in other specialties should also note the immunization status of children and
refer or immunize as appropriate.
Providers educate parents and guardians about
immunization in general terms.
Providers should educate parents and guardians in a culturally sensitive
way, preferably in their own language, about the importance of
immunizations, the diseases they prevent, the recommended
immunization schedules, the need to receive immunizations at recommended ages and the
importance of bringing their child’s immunization record to each visit. Parents should be
encouraged to take responsibility for ensuring that their child completes the full series.
Providers should answer all questions parents and guardians may have and provide
appropriate educational materials at suitable reading levels in pertinent languages.


Providers question parents or guardians about
contraindications and, before immunizing a child,
inform them in specific terms about the risks and
benefits of the immunizations their child is to
receive.


Minimal acceptable screening procedures for precautions and contraindications include
asking questions to elicit a possible history of adverse events following prior
immunizations and determining any existing precautions or contraindications (see
attached table).
The Vaccine Information Pamphlets (required by regulation1 to be used universally
beginning April 15, 1992 for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis
and Polio by all providers administering vaccine purchased from the federal contract)
should be provided and reviewed with parents or guardians. Private physicians who
purchase their own vaccines must use these pamphlets or must develop and use
alternative vaccine information materials that meet all the requirements of the law.
Similar information contained in the Important Information Statements for other vaccines
(e.g., hepatitis B and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b) should be provided to all parents or
guardians in public clinics and use of these statements should be considered by private
providers. Providers should ensure that information materials are current and available
in appropriate languages. Providers should ask parents or guardians if they have

1Federal Register 1991;56(199):51798-51818, Codiﬁed at 42 Code of Federal
Regulations Part 110


## p. 199 (#308) ############################################

questions about what they have read and should ensure that they receive satisfactory
answers to their questions.
Providers should explain where and how to obtain medical care during day- and night-
time hours in case of an adverse event following vaccination.

Providers follow only true contraindications.
Accepting conditions which are not true contraindications as being true
contraindications (see attached table) oﬁen results in the needless
deferment of indicated immunizations. The attached table of true
contraindications is based on the recommendations of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the recommendations of the Committee
on Infectious Diseases (Red Book Committee) of the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP). Sometimes these recommendations may vary from those contained in the
manufacturer’s package inserts. For more detailed information, providers should consult
the published recommendations of the ACIP, the AAP, the American Academy of Family
Physicians (AAFP), and the manufacturer’s package inserts.


Providers administer simultaneously all vaccine
doses for which a child is eligible at the time of
each visit.


Available evidence suggests that the simultaneous administration of
childhood immunizations is safe and effective. In addition, evidence
suggests that the simultaneous administration of multiple needed vaccines can potentially
raise immunization coverage by 9%-17%. If providers elect not to administer a needed
vaccine simultaneously with others (based either on their judgment that this action will
not compromise the timely immunization of the child or on a request by the parent or
guardian), they should document such actions and the reasons why the vaccine was not
administered. The record should be ﬂagged with an automatic recall for an appointment
to receive the needed vaccine(s). This next appointment should be discussed with the
parent or guardian of the child.
Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine should always be used in combined form when
providing routine childhood immunizations.
Providers use accurate and complete recording
procedures.
Providers are required by statute to record, what vaccine was given, the
date the vaccine was given (month, day, year), the name of the
manufacturer of the vaccine, the lot number, the signature and title of the





## p. 200 (#309) ############################################

person who gave the vaccine, and the address where the vaccine was given.2 In addition,
providers should record on the child’s personal immunization record card (preferably the
official state version) what vaccine was given, the date the vaccine was given and the
name of the provider. Providers should encourage parents or guardians to maintain a
copy of their child’s personal immunization record card. This card should be updated at
each visit for immunizations. If a parent fails to bring their child’s card, a new one
should be issued containing all previous immunizations and designated as a replacement
record card. When accepting immunization record data from parents, providers should
conﬁrm that prior doses of vaccines have actually been administered, either by reviewing
immunization record cards or by contacting former providers and entering this veriﬁed
information onto their records. When a provider who does not routinely vaccinate or care
for a child administers a vaccine to that child, the regular provider should be informed.
Providers with manual record-keeping systems should maintain separate or easily
retrievable ﬁles of the immunization records of preschoolers to facilitate assessment of
coverage as well as the identiﬁcation and recall of children who miss appointments. In
addition, preschooler immunization ﬁles should be sorted periodically, with inactive
records placed into a separate ﬁle. Providers should indicate in their records, or in an
appropriately identiﬁed place, all primary care services that each child receives in order to
facilitate co-scheduling with other services.
Providers co-schedule immunization appointments
in conjunction with appointments for other child
health services.


Providers of immunization-only services which require an appointment
should co-schedule immunization appointments with other needed health
care services such as WIC, dental exams or developmental screening provided such
scheduling does not create a barrier by delaying needed immunizations.
Providers report adverse events following
immunization promptly, accurately and completely.
Providers should encourage parents or legal guardians to inform them of
adverse events following immunization. Providers should report all such
clinically signiﬁcant events, including those required by law, to the
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), regardless of whether or not they
believe the events are caused by the vaccines. Report forms and assistance are available
by calling 1-800-822-7 967. Providers should document fully the adverse event in the
medical record at the time of the event or as soon as possible thereaﬁer.


242 US Code 300aa-25


## p. 201 (#310) ############################################

Providers operate a tracking system.
A tracking system should produce reminders of upcoming immunizations
as well as recalls for children who are overdue. A system may be
automated or manual and may include mailed or telephone messages. In
the public sector, health department staff may also make home visits. All
providers should identify, for additional intensive tracking efforts, children considered at
high risk of failing to complete the immunization series on schedule (e.g., children who
start their series late).


Providers adhere to appropriate procedures for
vaccine management.
Vaccines should be handled and ‘stored as recommended in the
manufacturer’s package inserts. The temperatures at which vaccines are
stored and transported should be monitored daily and the expiration date
for each vaccine should be noted.


Providers using publicly purchased vaccine should periodically report usage, wastage, loss
and inventory as required by state or local public health authorities.
Providers conduct semi-annual audits to assess
immunization coverage levels and to review
immunization records in the patient populations
they serve.



In both the public and private sector, the assessment of immunization services for pre-
school-aged patients should include audits of immunization records or inspection of a
random sample of records (1) to determine the immunization coverage level (i.e., the
percentage of children that are up-to-date by their second birthday), (2) to identify how
frequently opportunities for simultaneous immunization are missed and (3) to assess the
quality of documentation. The results of such assessments should be discussed by
providers as part of their ongoing quality assurance reviews and used to develop solutions
to the problems identiﬁed.



## p. 202 (#311) ############################################

Providers maintain up-to-date, easily retrievable
medical protocols at all locations where vaccines
are administered.


Providers administering vaccines should maintain a protocol which, at a
minimum, discusses the appropriate vaccine dosage, vaccine
contraindications, the recommended sites and techniques for vaccine administration as
well as possible adverse events and their emergency management. Such protocols should
specify the necessary emergency medical equipment, drugs (including dosage) and
personnel to safely and competently deal with any medical emergency which may arise
after the administration of a vaccine. All providers should be familiar with the content of
these protocols, their location and how to follow them. Vaccines can be administered in
any setting (e.g., schools, churches) where providers can adhere to these protocols.
Providers practice patient-oriented and community-
based approaches.
Public providers should routinely seek the input of their patients on
speciﬁc approaches to better serve their immunization needs and
implement the changes necessary to provide more user-friendly services.
Public providers should adopt a community-based approach to the provision of
immunization services which calls for reaching high coverage levels in their catchment
area populations and not only in the active patient populations they serve. Such a
community-based approach requires all public providers to publicize the availability of
their immunization services and to conduct community outreach activities to increase
demand for immunization services. Private providers should cooperate with local health
officials in their efforts to assure high coverage levels throughout the community.
Without high immunization coverage levels, no community is completely protected against
vaccine-preventable diseases. All providers share in the responsibility to achieve the
highest possible degree of community protection.


Vaccines are administered by properly trained
individuals.
Only properly trained individuals should administer vaccines. However,
the task of administering vaccines need not be assigned exclusively to
physicians and nurses. With appropriate training, including the
management of emergency situations, and under professional supervision, other personnel
can skillfully and safely administer vaccines. In some jurisdictions, statutory
requirements may limit the administration of vaccines to licensed physicians and-or

nurses which could therefore create barriers to immunization. If so, legal opinion should
be sought locally to determine the necessary steps to overcome this barrier.
Providers receive ongoing education and training
on current immunization recommendations.
Providers include all individuals who are involved in the administration
of vaccines, the management of immunization clinics, or the support of
these functions. Training and education should cover current guidelines
and recommendations of the ACIP, AAP and the AAFP as well as the Standards for
Immunization Practices and other immunization information sources such as the
manufacturer’s package inserts. Providers should also receive information about ongoing
national efforts to reach the year 2000 goal of 90% series complete immunization by the
second birthday.

*The events or conditions listed as precautions, although not contraindications, should be carefully reviewed. The beneﬁts and risks of
administering a speciﬁc vaccine to an individual under the circumstances should be considered. If the risks are believed to outweigh the
beneﬁts, the immunization should be withheld; if the beneﬁts are believed to outweigh the risks (for example, during an outbreak or
foreign travel), the immunization should be given. Whether and when to administer DTP to children with proven or suspected
underlying neurologic disorders should be decided on an individual basis. It is prudent on theoretical grounds to avoid vaccinating
pregnant women. However, if immediate protection against poliomyelitis is needed, OPV, not IPV, is recommended.
“Acetaminophen given prior to administering DTP and thereafter every 4 hours for 24 hours should be considered for children with a
personal or with a family history of convulsions in siblings or parents.
***There is a theoretical risk that the administration of multiple live virus vaccines (OPV & MMR) within 30 days of one another if not
given on the same day will result in a suboptimal immune response. There are no data to substantiate this.
****Persons with a history of anaphylactic reactions following egg ingestion should be vaccinated only with extreme caution. Protocols
have been developed for vaccinating such persons and should be consulted (J Pediatr 1983;102:196-9, J Pediatr 1988;113:504-6).
*****Measles vaccination may temporarily suppress tuberculin reactivity. If testing can not be done the day of MMR vaccination, the
test should be postponed for 4-6 weeks.
This information is based on the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and those of the
Committee on Infectious Diseases (Red Book Committee) of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Sometimes these
recommendations vary from those contained in the manufacturer’s package inserts. For more detailed information, providers
should consult the published recommendations of the ACIP, the AAP, the AAFP, and the manufacturer’s package inserts.

FOR OLDER ADULTS TO KNOW ABOUT VACCINES
Each year up to 60,000 adults, rmny aged 65 or older, die of preventable
infectious diseases (inﬂuenza, pneumococcal infection and hepatitis B).
All people 65 years of age or older should receive inﬂuenza and
pneumococcal vaccines. People who are in certain high risk groups should
receive hepatitis B vaccines.
Pneumonia and influenza, togetl'ter, are the SIXTH LEADING CAUSE OF
DEATH in the United States. Most of these deaths occur in people aged 65 or
older.
Inﬂuenza vaccine can prevent up to 70 percent of hospitalizations and 85
percent of deaths from inﬂuenza-related pneumonia.
Since influenza viruses change each year, people should receive the new
vaccine annually, usually in the fall. You cannot get inﬂuenza from the vaccine.
Inﬂuenza vaccine WILL NOT protect you from other respiratory infections,
such as colds and bronchitis.
Pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia,
accounting for up to one-third of all types of pneumonias that lead to
hospitalization.
Pneumococcal vaccine can prevent up to 60 percent of serious
pneumococcal infections, but it WILL NOT protect you from other types of
pneumonia.
Pneumococcal vaccine is usually a once-in-a-lifetirm shot. You cannot get
pneumonia from the vaccine.
Because most cases of tetanus and diphtheria occur in adults, ALL adults
should receive booster shots every 10 years. People who travel outside the US.
should be evaluated for other vaccines that may be necessary.

THE NATIONAL COALITION FOR ADULT IMMUNIZATION
The National Coalition for Adult Immunization (NCAI) is a network of organizations dedicated to promoting
adult immunization, primarily through educational and motivational activities. The Coalition was formed to
make the most efﬁcient use of public and private resources to achieve national goals in adult immunization.
The goal of the NCAI is to assist in efforts to raise immunization levels in high-risk and other adult target
groups by increasing awareness of physicians, other health care providers, and the general public about the
need for and the beneﬁts of immunization. The primary target diseases for which safe and effective vaccines
are available are influenza, pneumococcal disease, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, and
diphtheria, hepatitis A, and varicella.
The NCAI, formed in 1988, currently consists of more than 80 organizations, advocacy groups, vaccine
manufacturers, and government health agencies. Member organizations include the American Academy of
Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the American Hospital Health Association, the
Association of State and Territorial Health Ofﬁcials, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health
Insurance Association of America, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer’s Association, and the National Foundation
for Infectious Diseases, which also serves as the Executive Secretariat for the Coalition.
Since June 1988, the Steering Committee, NCAI has accomplished the following:
0 Promotion and support of the National Adult Immunization Awareness Week, begun by the National
Foundation for Infectious Diseases several years before the formation of NCAI. This activity, celebrated
nationally the last week in October, highlights collaborative efforts by Federal, state, and local health
agencies, public health organizations, and professional, private, volunteer, and other organizations to
improve adult immunization. NCAI is dedicated to developing activities to increase public awareness of
adult vaccine-preventable diseases, as recommended by goall #1 of the National Vaccine Advisory
Committee (NVAC) report.
0 Development and adoption of "Standards for Adult Immunization Practice" (copy attached). In addition
to national goals which guide the NCAI, the "Standards . . ." provide a pragmatic focus for the Coalition’s
information and education activities. The document is intended to unite the diverse interests of the member
organizations and offers a foundation of common goals among health care providers, policymakers, and
consumer interest groups.
Q Fostered the formation of three working action groups which conduct disease-speciﬁc informational and
educational activities. These groups are:
0 The Influenza-Pneumonia Action Group, chaired by the Institute for Advanced Studies and Aging
(IASID)
° The Measles-Mumps-Rubella Action Group, chaired by the American College Health Association
(ACHA).
O The Hepatitis B Action Group, chaired by the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID).
The action groups are the lifeblood of the NCAI. The activities of these working subcommittees determine the
success or failure of the Coalition. The current status of the action groups is described below.


## p. 213 (#322) ############################################

Inﬂuenza/Pneumococcal Action Group (I/P AG)
The I/P AG, chaired by the American Lung Association was formed in May 1989. This group has formed
eight state and local-based coalitions across the United States to promote inﬂuenza and pneumococcal
immunizations. Membership in these coalitions is broad-based, similar to that of the NCAI. The I/P AG
developed a resource guide for the eight sites to provide guidance in reaching health care providers in hospitals,
nursing homes, health maintenance organizations, private physician ofﬁces, and public health clinics. Each
of the eight I/P sites has taken a different approach on project initiatives, from focusing on immunization policy
development to local promotional campaigns. Additional strategies for the UP AG include implementing a
cooperative program with the American Association of Retired Persons and developing culturally speciﬁc
materials for minority communities, and working with medicine to provide inﬂuenza and pneumococcal
vaccination.
Measles-Mumps-Rubella-Varicella Action Group (MMR AG)
The primary focus of the MMR AG is to promote the two-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination
schedule, with a special focus on the high-risk adult groups of post-secondary students, health care personnel,
and international travelers. The MMR AG members have concentrated on the following two major activities:
1. Health Education Project: The development of a poster and brochure for high school and college
students, and development of a model health education unit for high schools.
2. Model prematriculation immunization requirement (PIR) legislation: The model PIR has been
developed by health experts represented on the AG, in conjunction with a health care legal ﬁrm, after
review of existing legislation in all states which currently have PIRs. The primary purpose of the
model PIR is to establish a system to require evidence of immunity by all post-secondary students
against vaccine-preventable diseases. The AG’s goal is to have the model FIR legislation become a
reference in the library of the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Hepatitis B Action Group (H/B AG)
The purpose of the H/B AG is to promote, through information and education, the current recommendations
for hepatitis B vaccine, for adolescents and higher risk adults. The work of the H/B AG has been delegated
to two subcommittees to develop information and educational materials for their target groups:
0 The Adolescent and High-Risk Adult subcommittees.
The NCAI relies on the member organizations to support their own representatives to attend meetings and to
utilize existing communications channels to reach speciﬁc constituencies of the member organizations.
Financial support of action group activities is dependent on funding sources to implement realistic and
reasonable action plans to improve cost-effective health care for adults.
Membership in the NCAI is open to all organizations with an interest in adult health issues. There is no
membership fee. For further information about joining the Coalition, please write The National Coalition for
Adult Immunization, 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, Maryland 20814.

This report was submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Health by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee
(NVAC) in 1994. It lays the framework for the improvement of adult immunization in the United States.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
NVAC Report on Adult Immunization
Immunization programs in the United States have dramatically reduced the occurrence of many childhood
diseases. Several of the classic diseases -- diphtheria, pertussis, measles, rubella, and mumps -- have been
largely controlled. Indigenous poliomyelitis has been eliminated and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b meningitis
is fast disappearing. Nonetheless, the recent resurgence of measles, reports of congenital rubella syndrome,
and questions about the safety of pertussis vaccine have been sober reminders of the need for constant vigilance
if these diseases are to remain controlled. Our nation’s response has been an unhesitating commitment to
expand our childhood immunization efforts.
The contrast between the occurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases of adults compared with those of
children is striking. In the United States, fewer than 500 persons each year die of vaccine-preventable diseases
of childhood, whereas 50,000 to 70,000 adults die of inﬂuenza, pneumococcal infections, and hepatitis B. The
overall costs to society of these and other vaccine-preventable diseases of adults exceed 10 billion dollars each
year. Yet adult vaccines are not widely used. Among the reasons given to explain this are (1) limited
appreciation of the importance of adult vaccine-preventable diseases; (2) doubts about the safety and efﬁcacy
of adult vaccines; (3) different target groups for different vaccines necessitating selective rather than universal
approaches to vaccination; (4) few organized programs in either the public or private sectors to deliver adult
vaccines; and (5) neglect of the reimbursement system for adult immunization. If adult immunization is more
complex than childhood vaccination, this does not mean that it has been ignored. Two new vaccines --
pneumococcal and hepatitis B -- have been introduced in recent years. Many professional organizations have
recommended adult vaccines and developed programs for their delivery. The federal government has also taken
an active role, most notably in the Medicare Influenza Vaccine Demonstration conducted during the period 1988
to 1992.
Any discussion of adult immunization in the United States must take place within the context of the debate
over health care reform. The demonstrated cost-effectiveness of several adult vaccines adds a note of urgency
to these discussions. Improving adult immunization will require greater awareness of the importance of vaccine-
preventable diseases and the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines. It will require closer working relationships
among health care professionals, vaccine companies, and the payers for health care services.
This report of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee describes ﬁve major goals for adult immunization
in the United States. These goals and 18 recommendations for achieving these goals are set forth in this
Executive Summary. The ﬁndings that underlie these recommendations and the 72 strategies recommended for
their implementation are described in the body of this report. None of these goals will be reached without
giving attention to all. The task is complex and the effort and resources needed to achieve success will be
substantial. In undertaking this work we should remind ourselves that our nation’s programs for childhood
immunization have reduced the costs of health care and improved the well-being of all our children. We can
and should expect no less from our efforts to immunize adults.


## p. 215 (#324) ############################################

I. GOAL: INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR ADULT VACCINATION BY IMPROVING

PROVIDER AND PUBLIC AWARENESS.
Increasing the demand for adult vaccination must begin with improving the awareness of both health care
providers and the general public of the health impact vaccine-preventable diseases and their costs. It will be
equally important to improve understanding of the effectiveness and safety of adult vaccines. However, this
knowledge must be used in such a way that it leads to changes in behavior -- health care providers to offer
vaccines and adults to expect, ask for, and accept recommended vaccines. Programs to increase awareness must
not focus simply on increasing content knowledge; i.e., that the diseases are "bad" and the vaccines "good".
They must go further and address behaviors that affect vaccine delivery at every level -- the individual, the
institution, and society at large.
I.A. Recommendation: Effective informational programs on adult immunization must be conducted for
health care providers on a regular basis to improve their vaccination practices.
I. B. Recommendation: Eﬁ'ecrive information programs must be regularly conducted that educate the public
on the importance of vaccine-preventable diseases of adults and the safety and benefits of
immunization.
II. GOAL: ASSURE THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS AN ADEQUATE CAPACITY TO
DELIVER VACCINES TO ADULTS.
A highly efﬁcacious vaccine will not be effective in preventing disease unless it is given to those who will
beneﬁt. The importance of vaccine delivery has been dramatically demonstrated by the achievements of
childhood immunization in the United States. Immunization of almost all children by the time of school entry
has been responsible for the elimination of poliomyelitis and the control of other childhood vaccine-preventable
diseases. Yet, our nation’s inability to adequately vaccinate inner city children was a major factor underlying
the recent resurgence of measles.
An adequate capacity to deliver vaccines is as essential for adults as it is for childhood immunization. This
requires strong leadership from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), working in
collaboration with state and local health authorities. Generalist physicians will remain a major force in
vaccinating adults, but specialist physicians and institutions must recognize their need to become involved in
vaccinating special groups of patients. All health care institutions need to adopt and implement guidelines and
standards of adult immunization practice. Doing so will reduce the many opportunities that are currently missed
to prevent disease through the use of vaccines.
ILA. Recommendation: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies should
assume increased responsibility for assuring that adults are immunized. A federal adult immunization
grant program separate from childhood immunization programs should be established to drill"! stale
and local health departments to improve adult vaccination.
II. B. Recommendation: All health care providers should be urged to reduce "missed opportunities "for adult
immunization.


## p. 216 (#325) ############################################

II. C. Recommendation: All adults who receive their primary care from general physicians should be
appropriately vaccinated.
II.D. Recommendation: Adults who receive their principal care from specialist physicians, other health care
providers or health care institutions should be appropriately vaccinated.
II.E. Recommendation: Public and private health care systems should develop and implement guidelines
and standards for adult immunization practice as part of their quality assurance programs.
IH. GOAL: ASSURE ADEQUATE FINANCING MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT THE
EXPANDED DELIVERY OF VACCINES TO ADULTS.
Childhood vaccination programs have long received partial ﬁnancial support from federal, state, and local
governments, and the level of support has increased dramatically in recent years. In contrast, the ﬁnancing of
adult immunization has been left largely in the hands of individuals. Coverage for adult immunization services
has been largely ignored by health insurance companies. Federal reimbursement for inﬂuenza vaccination was
speciﬁcally prohibited by Medicare regulations until 1993, and inadequately implemented for pneumococcal
vaccination since 1981. Although adult immunizations are very inexpensive and remarkably cost-effective
compared with most other health care services, they are often ignored by patients and providers alike.
Increasing adult immunization will require adequate public and private ﬁnancing mechanisms to support vaccine
delivery.
III.A. Recommendation: All publicly funded health insurance programs should adequately reimburse
providers for the costs of adult vaccines and their administration.
III. B. Recommendation: All private health insurance companies should adequately reimburse providers for
the cost of adult vaccines and their administration.
III. C. Recommendation: All proposals for national health care reform should include adult immunization
services as covered beneﬁts and provide mechanisms to ﬁnance their delivery.
IV. GOAL: MONITOR AND IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE NATION’S
VACCINE DELIVERY SYSTEM.
The nation’s ability to control vaccine-preventable diseases requires continuing surveillance of the diseases
themselves, an assured manufacturing capacity to provide the vaccines needed, and periodic assessment of
whether the vaccines are reaching the persons for whom they are intended. The resurgence of measles during
1989-1991 illustrate the important interplay between these three features of our nation’s system for childhood
vaccination. The CDC’s surveillance system was quick to spot the increase in reported cases of measles,
especially in large urban areas. However, the CDC was less effective in monitoring the delivery of measles
vaccine to children in the inner-city areas that later became centers of measles outbreaks. It quickly became
apparent that minority children, especially Hispanic and black preschoolers, were disproportionately affected
by the outbreak. It can be argued that if adequate information on their measles vaccination levels had been
available beforehand, vaccination programs could have been organized and the outbreak prevented. Fortunately,



## p. 217 (#326) ############################################


the sole U. S. manufacturer was able to provide enough measles vaccine for outbreak control efforts and for
the expansion in vaccine use that followed the ACIP’s 1989 recommendation that children and certain adults
be given a second dose.
I V.A. Recommendation: Surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases must be expanded to ensure the
eﬁective and eﬂ‘icient use of vaccines in adults.
IV. B. Recommendation: The capacity of the nation ’s vaccine manufacturers to meet current and ﬁiture needs
for adult vaccines must be preserved and strengthened.
IV. C. Recommendation: The nation 's vaccine delivery system must endeavor to meet the adult immunization
goals set forth in Healthy People 2000.
V. GOAL: ASSURE ADEQUATE SUPPORT FOR RESEARCH ON
(1) VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES OF ADULTS,
(2) ADULT VACCINES, (3) ADULT IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES, (4) NEW AND
IlVIPROVED VACCINES, (5) INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR ADULT
IMlVIUNIZATION.
Improvements in the control of vaccine-preventable diseases of adults will come from continued research.
Understanding the biology of the agents of disease and their interactions with their hosts will suggest new
approaches for vaccine development. Research on how vaccines are used in practice will assure that they are
given to everyone who will beneﬁt. The complexities of developing new and improved vaccines will require
extensive collaboration between individuals and institutions in the public and private sectors. Research on adult
vaccines and their use in other countries will expand our understanding of the possibilities for better control
of vaccine-preventable diseases of adults throughout the world.
V.A.
V.B.
V.C.
V.D.
V.E.
Recommendation: Research on vaccine-preventable diseases of adults is ﬁmdamenral to their
prevention and must be assured continued support.
Recommendation: The viability of our nation ’s adult immunization programs requires evidence of the
continued eﬁicacy, safety, clinical effectiveness, cost-beneﬁts and cost-eﬂectiveness of currently
available adult vaccines, and research in these areas must be assured adequate support.
Recommendation: The epidemiology of immunization practices must be better understood if we are to
use adult vaccines more effectively and with greater efficiency.
Recommendation: The health beneﬁts of adult immunization with several currently available vaccines
will be enhanced by improved vaccines and other diseases will become preventable with new vaccines.
Research and development of these vaccines must be assured continued and stable support.
Recommendation: Research on all aspects of adult immunization must expand to include other
developed and developing countries.

Increases in inﬂuenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates
0 The Healthy People 2000 goal for inﬂuenza vaccination coverage of noninstitutionalized persons at risk
of complications is 60%. Inﬂuenza vaccination levels in such persons 265 years of age have steadily
improved from 23% in 1985 to 42% in 1991. The 1993 vaccination level in this age group was 52%,
based on preliminary data from the NCHS’ 1993 National Health Interview Survey. Pneumococcal
vaccination levels in persons 265 years of age have also increased, although not as markedly as those
for inﬂuenza vaccine. In 1985, only 11% of such persons reported ever having received pneumococcal
vaccine, 21% in 1991, and 28% in 1993 (1993 data provisional). Overall vaccination levels (all ages)
and levels for persons aged 18-64 years with high-risk conditions are substantially lower. The increases
in vaccine coverage may be attributable to better acceptance by practitioners and the public of
preventive medical services, increasing delivery of vaccine by non-physicians such as visiting nurse
and home health agencies, and lack of perceived risk associated with vaccination (CDC. Inﬂuenza and
pneumococcal vaccination coverage levels among persons aged 265 years. MMWR 1995;44:506-
7,513-5).
CDC and Medicare Collaborative Activities
The CDC is actively working to improve inﬂuenza and pneumococcal vaccination levels. The National
Immunization Program, CDC, has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the Health Care
Financing Administration (HCFA) to implement collaborative efforts to promote inﬂuenza and pneumococcal
vaccination through Medicare.
These collaborative projects with HCFA include:
1.
Promotion of, and technical assistance in design and implementation of, State-based intervention
projects implemented through HCFA’s State Peer Review Organizations (PROs), designed to increase
inﬂuenza vaccination. These include efforts to improve statewide promotion of vaccination; target-
based strategies for providers; provider reminder systems; and implementation of standing orders and
reminder systems for inpatient facilities. These were begun in a few States for the 1995-96 inﬂuenza
season; other States will be planning projects for the 1996-97 inﬂuenza season.
Assisting HCFA with its annual national campaign, the Consumer Information Strategy (CIS) to
promote use of Medicare vaccination and other preventive services, including providing technical
assistance to develop the consumer information strategy materials which are distributed to Medicare
providers and beneﬁciaries.
Examining pneumococcal vaccination coverage among Medicare part B recipients during the period
1989-1993 to determine trends in coverage and identify target populations for interventions.
Providing technical assistance in design and analysis of a nursing home survey to assess inﬂuenza
vaccination coverage and practices in long-term care facilities.

3.
Working with PROs and State Immunization Projects to establish action-based coalitions focused on
improving delivery of vaccination services.
Providing technical assistance on efforts to determine factors inﬂuencing a persons decision to receive
inﬂuenza vaccination.
Providing technical assistance on activities to enhance media involvement.
CDC intervention demonstration projects include:
1.
A community-based vaccination project to assess reasons for under-vaccination and implement
interventions to raise vaccination rates among older Hispanic Americans.
Surveillance of pneumococcal disease and activities to improve pneumococcal vaccination levels in
intervention and control areas in New Jersey.
Developing a computer-based training module on vaccination strategies designed to provide continuing
education for health care practitioners.
Collaborative projects with HCFA planned for 1996 include:
1.
Developing a pneumococcal consumer information strategy or incorporating pneumococcal vaccination
into the 1996 inﬂuenza campaign.
Providing technical assistance in the development of the inﬂuenza CIS materials which are distributed
to Medicare providers and beneﬁciaries.
Executing a provider needs assessment to determine barriers to inﬂuenza vaccination and Medicare
reimbursements.
Executing a Medicare beneﬁciary survey to identify barriers to receiving inﬂuenza vaccination.
Compiling and reporting annually information on successful vaccination strategies based on a thorough
review of existing literature and the experience of PRO’s.
Information urging beneﬁciaries to receive inﬂuenza vaccine is sent to Medicare part B carriers and providers

DRAFT ACIP ADOLESCENT IMMUNIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS
Adopted February 1995 (in press)
Immunization programs in the United States which focus on infants and children have greatly decreased the
occurrence of many childhood infections (1). However, many vaccine preventable diseases continue to affect
adolescents and young adults including hepatitis B, measles, and rubella. Generally, vaccination programs have
not focused on improving vaccination coverage among adolescents.
The recommendations for immunization at ll-l2 years of age issued by the ACIP (to be published in early
1996) are consistent with those of other advisory groups. A routine preventive care visit at age ll-l2 years
offers an ideal opportunity to assure vaccination of those not previously vaccinated with MMR dose 2, hepatitis
B, and varicella vaccines, deliver tetanus and diphtheria toxoid (Td) boosters, and provide other vaccines that
may be recommended for certain adolescents as well as vaccines that may be recommended in the future.
Flexibility in administering vaccines is needed when working with adolescents. Since several vaccines
including multiple dose vaccines may be indicated, providers may need to determine which vaccines to
administer during the initial visit and schedule the adolescent for return visits.
Adolescent Preventive Health Services
There is an important need to integrate recommendations for immunization with other preventive services
provided to adolescents. Recently, a number of national advisory groups have emphasized the importance of
improving adolescent vaccination levels, in addition to providing other preventive services indicated for
adolescents and young adults (Table 2). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has long been a proponent
of adolescent immunization and has developed specific recommendations (2,3). The American Medical
Association (AMA) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) have proposed
comprehensive recommendations that provide a framework for organizing the content of preventive health
services for adolescents, including immunizations (4,5). The United States Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) has advocated speciﬁc immunizations for adolescents and adults tailored and scheduled according
to the patient’s age and other risk factors (6). The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) has made
recommendations for delivery of preventive services based on topics reviewed by the USPSTF and the AAFP
Commission on Public Health and Scientiﬁc Affairs (7). The various guidelines recommend the delivery of
preventive health services during a series of regular health visits between the ages of 11 and 21 years. These
services include speciﬁc guidance on health behaviors, screening for biomedical, behavioral, and emotional
conditions, and delivery of health services including immunizations. The recommendations for adolescent
immunization adopted by the ACIP, AAP and AAFP are compatible with recommendations of other groups
promoting adolescent preventive health services.
Recommendations
The recommendations for each vaccine are consistent with the currentACIP statements. The Td recommendation
has recently been changed to reﬂect the recommendation that the age of the ﬁrst Td booster may be decreased
from 14-16 years to ]I-12 years. The purpose of the adolescent visit is to ﬁtlly assess immunization status,
administer any immunizations that are missing, and schedule the indicated doses of vaccines not administered
during this visit. Specific recommendations include:

10.
The establishment of an immunization visit to screen for immunization deﬁciencies and administer indicated
vaccines that have not been received is recommended for all adolescents between the ages of 11-12 years.
Appointments for needed doses of vaccine which are not administered during the initial visit should also
be scheduled during the initial visit.
For adolescents who have had their primary series, a booster dose of Td vaccine can be given at age 11-12
years instead of 14-16 years, if no dose has been received during the previous 5 years. All subsequent Td
boosters should be given every 10 years.
All adolescents 11-12 years of age who were not previously vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine should be
vaccinated with a 3 dose series.
The second dose of MMR should be given at 4-6 or 11-12 years of age. The adolescent visit should be used
to assure that the second dose of MMR vaccine has been administered.
Immunization with varicella vaccine is recommended for adolescents age 11-12 years who do not have a
reliable history of chickenpox and have not received varicella vaccine.
Inﬂuenza vaccine is recommended for adolescents who, because of an underlying medical condition, are
at increased risk for complications of inﬂuenza. Others including adolescent household members in close
contact with persons in high-risk groups should also be vaccinated. Any adolescent may receive the vaccine
to reduce their likelihood of acquiring inﬂuenza infection.
Pneumococcal vaccine should be given to all adolescents with chronic illnesses associated with increased
risk of pneumococcal disease or its complications. The adolescent visit should be used to assure that the
vaccine has been administered to persons for whom it is indicated.
Hepatitis A vaccine should be given to adolescents who are traveling or living in countries with high or
intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A virus (HAV), live in communities with high endemic rates of HAV,
have chronic liver disease, are injecting drug users or are males who have sex with males.
Immunization status should be checked during all subsequent adolescent visits and deﬁciencies should be
corrected, including completion of the three-dose hepatitis B series.
Other indicated preventive services should be provided during this and all other adolescent visits.

Special Communication —
Adult Immunization
Summary of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee Report
David S. Fedson, MD. for the National Vaccine Advisory Committee
In January 1994 the National Vaccine Advisory Committee adopted a report lhal
reviewed the status of adult immunization in the United States. Vaccine-
preventable infections of adults represent a continuing cause of morbidity and
mortality. Their major impact is among older persons. Effective and safe vaccines
against these diseases are available, but they are poorly used. Several reasons
account for low immunization levels among adults. including inadequate aware-
ness by health care providers and the public of the importance and benefits of
vaccination. Health care providers often fail to take advantage of opportunities
to immunize adults during office, clinic, and hospital contacts and fail to organize
programs in medical settings that ensure adults are offered the vaccines they
need. Inadequate reimbursement for adult immunization by public and private
health insurers and a lack of federal programs to support vaccine delivery are
also major problems. The National Vaccine Advisory Committee's report in-
cludes five goals and 18 recommendations for improving adult immunization. To
reach the Public Health Service adult immunization goals for the year 2000, the
Committee recommends (1) improvements in public and provider education; (2)
major changes in clinical practice; (3) increased financial support by public and
private health insurers; (4) improved surveillance of vaccine-preventable dis-
eases and vaccine production and delivery; and (5) support for research on
vaccine-preventable diseases, new and improved vaccines, immunization prac-
tices, and international programs for adult immunization.
IMMUNIZATION programs in the
United States have dramatically reduced
the occurrence of many childhood infec-
tious diseases (Table 1).‘2 Diphtheria and
childhood tetanus have practically disap-
peared, and fatalcasesof pertussis (whoop-
ing cough) are rare.3 N 0 cases of indig-
enous poliomyelitis have been reported
since 1979.‘ The occurrence of measles
has been substantially reduced.5 Cases of
childhood rubella are rarely observed, and
there are few reports of congenital ru-
bella syndrome.6 Childhood mumps is sel-
dom encountered by physicians.7 The re-
cent extraordinary decline in Haemophi-
lus influenzae type b meningitis is largely
attributable to widespread use of Hae-
mophilus influenzae type b vaccines.”
Nonetheless, the reemergence of measles
during the period 1989 through 1991,5 the
persistence of congenital rubella syn-
drome,6 and lingering questions about the
safety of pertussis vaccine” are sobering
reminders that control of vaccine-prevent-
able childhood diseases requires constant
vigilance. Our nation has responded with
an unhesitating commitment of resources

A complete list of committee members appears at
the end of this article.

to expand our immunization efforts, most
notably the president's Childhood Immu-
nization Initiative.10
The contrast between the impact of
vaccine-preventable diseases of adults
compared with those of children is strik-
ing. Each year, fewer than 500 persons in
the United States die of vaccine-prevent-
able diseases of childhood. By compari-
son, 50000 to 70000 adults die of inﬂu-
enza, pneumococcal infections, and hepa-
titis B (Table 2).u In addition, many child-
hood vaccine-preventable infections are
now found among young adults. Out-
breaks of measles,m rubella,“ and
mumps?“ have caused major disruptions
on college campuses, in the workplace,
and in institutions such as hospitals and
prisons. Vaccine-preventable diseases re-
main an important cause of costly hospi-
talization, especially among the elderly.“
Currently, 98% or more of American
children are fully immunized by the time
of school entry.l Although in some com-
munities the proportion fully immunized
by 2 years of age is much lower, several
programs have been established to ad-
dress this problem.10 In contrast, and in
spite of the much heavier burden of dis-
ease, vaccines that are recommended for
adults are not widely used (Table 2).ll
Several reasons have been given to ex-
plain this. First, there is a limited per-
ception on the part of both health care
providers and the general public that adult
vaccine-preventable diseases are signiﬁ-
cant health problems. Second, there are
doubts in the minds of some health care
providers and the public about the efﬁ-
cacy and safety of several of the vaccines
used for adults. Third, adult immuniza-
tion is selective not universal; different
vaccines have diﬁ'erent target groups
(Table 3). Fourth, the sizes of the adult
target populations for individual vaccines
vary and for some vaccines are much
larger than the target population for child-
hood vaccination. Fifth, unlike the child-
hood vaccination schedule that must be
completed if children are to enter school,
there are no statutory requirements for
adult immunization. Sixth, unlike the child
health care practices in most communi-
ties, there are few programs in either the
public or private sectors for vaccinating
adults. Finally, reimbursement for adult
irmnunization has traditionally been ne-
glected by both government and private
insurers; children can usually obtain in-
expensive or free vaccines from public
health clinics, but until recently most
adults have had to pay the full costs for
most of their vaccines. The public avail-
ability of vaccines, school entry vaccina-
tion requirements, and responsible
parenting have given our nation a high
level of childhood immunization. In the
best of circumstances, it would be diﬁi-
cult to achieve the same for adults.
In spite of these problems, adult im-
munization has not been ignored. More
than 10 years ago two new vaccines for
adults were licensed: pneumococcal vac-
cine in 1977 and hepatitis B vaccine in
1983. The 1980s brought many new ini-
tiatives to promote adult immunization,
including those of the Advisory Commit-
tee on Immunization Practicesfw the
American College of Physicians,18 the In-
fectious Diseases Society ofAmerica,18 and
the US Preventive Services Task Force.“
In 1988 the Health Care Financing Ad-
ministration (HCFA) launched its Medi-
care Inﬂuenza Vaccine Demonstration.”
During the next 4 years, close to $69 mil-
lion was spent in a multifaceted program
to increase inﬂuenza vaccination among
Medicare enrollees and to evaluate its cost-
eﬁ'ectiveness and health beneﬁts.

Discussion of how to improve adult irn-
munization must be included in the de
bate over health system reform in the
United States. Vaccine-preventable dis-
eases of adults impose signiﬁcant health
care costs on the nation. Yet, there is
strong evidence that adult inununization
is highly cost-eﬂ'ective)” Thus, the choice
we face is not simply deciding whether to
pay for adult immunization, it is whether
to pay more for the costs of treating un-
prevented illness or less for preventing it
from occurring in the ﬁrst place.
In January 1994 the National Vaccine
Advisory Committee (NVAC) adopted
a report that reviewed the status of adult
immunization in the United States.21 This
article summarizes the N VAC report,
including the committee's goals and rec-
orrunendations (Table 4).
1. INCREASE THE DEMAND
vaccines and 50% of target groups for
new vaccines (eg, hepatitis B vaccine)
should be vaccinated within 5 years of
vaccine licensure.’ In 1990 these goals
had not been reached.
Surveys conducted during the 1980s
showed that physicians generally under-
stood the importance of vaccine-prevent-
able diseases and knew about the efﬁcacy
and safety of vaccines recommended for
adults. However, they often failed to
translate their knowledge into clinical
practice.’ Several studies demonstrated
that good administration and organiza-
tion were the keys to the success of vac-
cination programs.a Although speciﬁc de-
tails varied, for each successful program
a decision had been made to establish an
organized approach for offering vaccines
to adults on a regular basis.

riousness of vaccine-preventable diseases

predate that influenza presents a risk of
severe illness that may lead to hospital
admission or death.” Most elderly patients
have no knowledge of the frequency or
severity of pneumococcal infections. Few
young adults who have multiple sexual
partners understand their risks for ac-
quiring hepatitis B. Many adults are un-
aware of the clinical eﬁ'ectiveness and
safety of the vaccines that can prevent
these diseases. Educational programs can
help increase public understanding of the
need for and beneﬁts of adult irnmuniza-
tion. This was illustrated recently during
the HCFA Medicare Inﬂuenza Vaccine
Demonstration, when a letter sent to
Medicare enrollees by the HCFA admin-
istrator was helpful in persuading older
persons to get vaccinated.“
The NVAC recommends that educa-
tional programs be undertaken to improve
the adult immunization practices of phy-
sicians and other health care providers.
These programs should emphasize wide-
spread dissemination of the goals and rec-
ommendations for adult immunization, pe-
riodic assessment of provider knowledge
and attitudes about vaccines and immu-
nimtion practices, and better understand-
ing of the administrative and organiza-
tional features of successful vaccination
programs. Greater emphasis should be
given to adult immunization in profes-
sional education and certiﬁcation, and
more attention should be devotedto prac-
tical approaches for vaccine delivery in
training programs, including appropriate
immunization of students and trainees
themselves. The committee recommends
that the public also be better informed of
the importance of vaccine-preventable dis-
eases of adults and of the safety and ben-
eﬁts of immunization. This will require an
understanding of factors that constitute
barriers or promote easy access to vac-
cination services. The committee recom-
mends educational programs and media
campaigns for adult immunization, espe-
cially those that are linked to announce-
ments routinely directed to target popu-
lations by government agencies and com-
munity organizations.
2. ASSURE THAT THE HEALTH
CARE SYSTEM HAS AN ADEQUATE
CAPACITY TO DELIVER
VACClNES TO ADULTS
An emcacious vaccine will be eﬂ'ective
in preventing disease only if it is given to
those who will beneﬁt. The importance of
vaccine delivery has been dramatically
demonstrated by the contributions of the
Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) to childhood immunisation. Ap-
proximately half of all children in the
United States are immunized through
state and 10ml public health programs that
use vaccines purchased under federal con-
tracts negotiated by the CDC.1 Studies
by CDC investigators on the epidemiol-
ogy of vaccine-preventable diseases, the
susceptibility of children to infection, and
the shortcomings of vaccine delivery pro-

guarantee the regular oﬁ‘ering of vaccines
to adults, develop and implement stan-
dards and practice guidelines for adult
immunization, and include regular evalu-
ation of immunization practices as part of
their quality assurance programs.
3. ASSURE ADEQUATE FINANCING
MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT
'TD-IE EXPANDED DELIVERY
OF VACCINES TO ADULTS
Childhood immunization programs
have long received ﬁnancial support from
federal, state, and local governments. Pub-
lic agencies have been much less involved
with adult immunization; in 1991 less than
10% bf all doses of inﬂuenza and pneu-
mococcal vaccines used in the United
States were given by state and local health
departments (CDC, unpublished data,
1993). To address this problem, in 1981
the Congress instructed the HCFA to
pay physicians for pneumococcal vacci-
nation of elderly patients under Part B of
the Medicare program.” In 1984 reim-
bursement for hepatitis B vaccination was
added for Medicare patients with end-
stage renal disease. In 1993 Medicare was
authorized to pay for inﬂuenza vaccine
and its administration.“
The implementation of Medicare reim-
bursement for vaccination has not mea-
stu'ed up to its promise. For example,
Medicare reimbursement for pneumococ-
ml vaccination during the 1980s barely
covered the cost of the vaccine alone.”
Each year during the period 1985 through
1988,only300000to400000doses of pneu-
mococcal vaccinr.~25% of all doses dis-
tributed nationwide-could be accounted
for by the Medicare reimbursement pro-
gram. Whether adequate reimbursement
is important for adult immunization should
become apparent in Medicare’s recently
established program to pay for annual
inﬂuenza vaccination.
There is little information on the ex-
tent to which private health insurance
companies provide coverage for adult im-
munization. Health maintenance organi-
zations may provide such services, but
their immunization rates are often no bet-
ter than those of patients covered by tra-

grams provide the basis for the Childhood
Immunization Initiative.‘° This research
has shown that the majority of children
and adults who develop vaccine-prevent-
able illnesses have been seen previously
by health care providers and could have
been vaccinated at the time but were not.as
Such “missed opportunities" for vaccina-
tion have several causes, including mis-
conceptions about contraindications to vac-
cination and the lack of an organized ap-
proach to offering vaccines. The failure to
prevent vaccine-preventable diseases is
far more often due to the failure to vac-
cinate rather than to the failure of the
vaccines themselves. The costs of these
'Missed opportunities” are very high.
Most vaccines given to adults are ad-
ministered by generalist physicians, yet
wide variations have been shown in their
immunization practices.1823 Many adults
who should be vaccinated receive their
principal care from specialists rather than
general physicians or from highly spe-
cialized teams of health care profession-
als or administrative units such as clinics.
In such settings, a single focus of respon-
sibility for offering vaccines is often dif~
ﬁcult to identify. Thus, efforts to improve
adult immunization must focus on devel-
oping workable systems for regularly of-
fering vaccines to patients at risk, re-
gardless of where they receive their care.
Such systems should reﬂect practice
guidelines, and their evaluation should
become a common feature of quality as-
surance and accreditation programs.
The N VAC recommends that the CDC
and other federal agencies assume in-
creased responsibility for assuring that
adults are appropriately This
will require support for vaccine purchase
and program administration at the state
and local levels, as well as increased staﬁ'
and support at the CDC itself. The corn-
mittee urges that all health care provid-
ere, whether generalists or specialists, con-
sider any contact with adult patients as
an opportunity to provide recommended
vaccines. The committee recommends that
health care providers and the institutions
in which they practice adopt administra-
tive and organizational arrangements that

ditional health insurance.” Reliance on
regulatory approaches to improve private
health insurance coverage of adult im-
munization may not be sufﬁcient; busi-
nesses that self-insure their employees
are not subject to regulation by state gov-
ernments. Proposals for health system
reform usually include coverage of child-
hood immunization. Similar coverage is
needed for adult immunization.
The NVAC recommends that publicly
funded health insurance programs ad-
equately reimburse providers for the
costs of vaccines and their administra-
tion to adults. Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursement policies must be moni-
tored to ensure that they are effectively
implemented by ﬁscal intermediaries and
providers alike. When problems are iden-
tiﬁed, technical assistance must be pro-
vided and ﬁnancial or other incentives
considered so that adults enrolled in these
programs are appropriately Similarly, the committee recommends
that private health insurance companies
adequately reimburse providers for adult
immunization, without requiring indi-
vidual co-payments or deductibles. Busi-
ness and labor leaders and state-health
insurance regulators should encourage
inclusion of adult immunization as a cov-

the committee strongly recommends that
all national health system reform pro-
posals include coverage for adult immu-
nimtion servicesandprovidemechamsms
to ﬁnance their delivery.
4. MONITOR AND IMPROVE THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE NATION'S
VACCINE DELIVERY SYSTEM
The nation’s ability to control vaccine-
preventable diseases requires continu-
ing surveillance of the diseases them-
selves, an assured manufacturing capac-
ity to provide the vaccines needed, and
periodic assessment of whether the vac-
cines are reaching the persons for whom
they are intended.
The effective and efﬁcient use of vac-
cines in adults depends on a clear un-
derstanding of which diseases are epi-
demiologically important and which per-
sons are at risk of infection. The CDC
works closely with state and local health
departments to monitor the occurrence
of vaccine-preventable diseases. For ex-
ample, it regularly provides timely ad-
vice on the identity of inﬂuenza viruses
causing outbreaks and information on
whether the current influenza vaccine
should be protective?’7 Surveillance by
the CDC has provided better under-
standing of the epidemiology of hepati-
tis B” and pneumococcal infections.”
These programs could be improved if
inexpensive methods were developed for
more rapid diagnosis of disease. Sur-
veillsnce is also essential for accurately
assessing the economic impact of vac-
cine-preventable diseases.
The success of our nation's immuniza-
tion programs depends on the capacity of
our vaccine manufacturers to produce and
distribute a constant supply of vaccine
products. During the swine influenza pro-
gram in 1976, our system for vaccine sup-
ply was severely tested.” In the 1981s
liability costs contributed to the rise in
prices for childhood vaccines and seriously
threatened the economic viability of vac-
cine manufacturers.“1 The National Vac-
cine Injury Compensation Program, es-
tablished in 1986, provides a mechanism
by which claims for childhood vaccine-as-
sociated injuries can now be settled,” Al-
though its implementation has been costly
and not without problems, the program
has succeeded in stabilizing the market
for the vaccine manufacturers.
One reason why the 1990 goals for adult
immunization were not reached may be
the failure to monitor adult immunization
practices. In 1989 the National Center for
Health Statistics began to gather better
information on vaccination levels against
inﬂuenza, pneumococcal disease, tetanus,
and diphtheria. Its National Health In-
terview Survey has shown, for example,
1130 JAMA, October 12. 1994-Vol 272, No. 14
that only 20% of elderly persons have ever
received pneumococcal vaccine.“ How-
ever, little is known about geographic
variations in the use of this vaccine or
about vaccination rates in persons at in-
creased risk of disease. For hepatitis B
vaccine, a great deal is known about vac-
cination status of health care workers,
but almost nothing is known about the
status of the other high-risk groups that
account for more than 95% of all cases of
the disease.”
The N VAC recommends that surveil~
lance of vaccine-preventable diseases by
the CDC and by state and local health
agencies be strengthened, including the
development of better methods of diag-
nosing disease. The committee recom-
mends that the capacity of the nation's
vaccine manufacturers to meet current
and future needs for vaccines be peri-
odically assessed to identify potential
technical, regulatory, ﬁnancial, legal, or
political problems that could threaten
adequate supplies of vaccines for adult
immunization. This assessment should
also determine the appropriate level of
federal involvement in vaccine purchase,
production, and compensation for vaccine-
related adverse events. To reach the adult
immunization goals of Healthy People
2000, the committee recommends more
detailed evaluation of vaccination levels
in adults with speciﬁc high-risk condi-
tions and in speciﬁc population groups at
risk. It also recommends support for pro-
grams to improve vaccine delivery where
munumzation rates are found to be un-
satisfactory. (The adult immunization
goals of Healthy People 2000 provide for
increases in immunization levels as fol-
Iowa: (1) pneumococcal pneumonia and
influenza immunization among institution-
alized chronically ill or older people to at
least 80%; (2) pneumococcal pneumonia
and inﬂuenza immunization among non-
institutionalized, high-risk populations as
deﬁned by the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices to at least 60%;
and (3) hepatitis B immunization among
high-risk populations, including infants
or surface antigen-positive mothers, to
at least 90%; occupationally exposed work-
ers to at least 90%; intravenous-drug us-
ers in drug treatment programs to at least
50%; and homosexual men to at least 50%.)
5. ASSURE ADEQUATE SUPPORT
FOR RESEARCH
Basic research on the viruses and bac-
teria that cause disease is essential ifwe
are to develop new and improved vac-
cines.“ Equally important is research on
host responses to infection and vaccina-
tion, especially the responses of older
adults whose immune system become
less responsive with advancing age. For
each vaccine, evaluation of its ef-
ﬁcacy must be followed by an assessment
of its clinical effectiveness in preventing
the more serious and costly outcomes of
disease. In addition, much more needs to
be known about the health and economic
consequences of vaccinepreventable dis-
eases. The cost-effectiveness of adult im-
munization must be further assessed; cur-
rent evidence suggests that inﬂuenza and
pneumococcal vaccination are highly cost-
eﬂ'ective when compared with other pre-
ventive, screening, and treatment inter-
ventions in common use among elderly
persons.” New knowledge about the epi-
demiology of vaccine-preventable diseases
must be accompanied by research on the
epidemiology of efforts to prevent these
diseases, including variations in the vac-
cination practices of health care provid-
era. The importance of this research is
illustrated by a recent study showing that
persons at greatest risk of inﬂuenza were
least likely to be vaccinated.8
Research has provided several new
and improved vaccines that may beneﬁt
adults, including cold-adapted live in-
ﬂuenza, pneumococcal conjugate, vari-
cella-zoster, hepatitis A, and acellular
pertussis vaccinesfiu' Promising new
methods of vaccine administration are
being developed, including newer adju-
vants, epitope-based strategies that re-
ﬂect an understanding of antigen rec-
ognition sites, particulate antigens de-
livered as microcapsules, glycoconjugate
preparations, immunologic boosting with
cytokines and lymphokines, and the use
of vaccine vectors.
Whether adults in the United States
are to be protected against vaccine-pre-
veritable diseases will depend to some
extent on the occurrence of these dis-
eases in other parts of the world. Current
international programs for monitoring dis-
eases such as inﬂuenza need to be supple
mented by surveillance programs for
other emerging and reemerging infectious
diseases, such as diphtheria in countries
of the former Soviet Union,35 a new strain
of Vibrio choleme in South Asia,” and
the spread of antimicrobial-resistant
Streptococcus pneumzmihe in many coun-
tries.” International disease surveillance
and vaccination programs have already
paid rich dividends in the worldwide eradi-
cation of smallpox and the elimination of
poliomyelitis in the .Americas. Given the
promise of new and improved vaccines,
the Children's Vaccine Initiative has be-
come the organizing focus to coordinate
the transfer of new technologies for vac-
cine production and vaccine delivery to
developing countries.38 Many aspects of
this program have direct implications for
the development of new and improved
vaccines for adults.
The NVAC recommends continued
support of research on the microbiologi-

cal agents of and the host response to
vaccine-preventable infections, including
those of immunocompromised and aging
individuals. The committee urges the de-
velopment of better measures of the
health and economic consequences of cur-
rent and future vaccine-preventable dis-
eases. The committee recognizes that the
viability of our nation’s adult irnmuniza-
tion programs requires continued evi-
dence of the eﬁcacy, effectiveness, safety,
and cost-eﬁ'ectiveness of current and fu-
ture vaccines. The committee recom-
mends greater attention be given to stud-
ies of the epidemiolog of immunization
practices. Research on new and improved
vaccines for use in the United States and
internationally must be assured stable
and continuing support. Finally, the com-
mittee encourages greater collaboration
between federal agencies, nongoverrunen-
tal organizations, professional associa-
tions, and vaccine companies in the United
States and their counterparts in interna-
tional organizations and in countries
throughout the world.

CONCLUSION
In making its recommendations, the
NVAC recognizes that none of its goals
for adult immunization will be reached
without giving attention to all. The task is
complex and the eﬁort and resources
needed to achieve success will be sub-
stantial. However, in undertaking this
work, the committee is reminded that our
nation’s programs for childhood irnmuni-
mtion have reduced the costs of health
care and improved the well-being of all
our children. We can and should expect no
less from our eﬁ'orts to immunize adults.
The National Vaccine Program was established in
19% by the Public Health Service Act to achieve op-
timal prevention of infectious disease through im-
munintion and optimal prevention of adverse reac-
tions to vaccines. The program is responsible for

Vaccines are very expensive. Here’s what typical vaccines cost:
DTP: $10.10 per dose
Hepatitis B: $18.00 per dose
Polio: $10.47 per dose
Hib: $14.50 per dose
MMR: $25.87 per dose
If we don’t handle our vaccine properly, it will not protect our patients!
Vaccine Handling Rules
Refrigerate vaccine immediately when it is
received.* Store oral polio and varicella vaccine
in freezer. Do not store vaccine in the door of
the refrigerator.
Protect MMR from light at all times and keep
it cold. Don’t get the vial from the refrigerator
until time to reconstitute and administer.
Diluent does not need refrigeration if MMR is
administered right after diluent is added.
Rotate vaccine stock to avoid outdating. Note
the expiration dates on vials or cartons and use
short-dated vaccines ﬁrst. Keep vials and polio
dispettes in their cartons. Don’t use outdated
vaccine. Don’t over-order.
Safeguard the refrigerator. Make sure it stays
plugged in. It should have a safety lock type
plug.
Post a Warning sign so electricians or janitors
don’t accidentally unplug the refrigerator or
turn off the circuit or electricity.
Maintain proper temperatures in the
refrigerator (2°C to 8°C or 35°F to 46°F) and in
the freezer (-14°C or 7°F or lower). If space
allows, help keep temperatures stable by placing
big plastic containers of Water in the
refrigerator, cold packs (blue ice) in the freezer.
Check refrigerator and freezer twice a day, ﬁrst
thing in the morning and last thing at night.
AM: See if temperatures are correct. (Keep
kitchenware-type thermometers in both
refrigerator and freezer.)
PM: Make sure the doors are shut tightly and
the unit is plugged in.
*Refer to package insert for speciﬁc instructions on each vaccine. If you have questions about the condition of the
vaccines at the time of delivery, ﬁrst store them properly, then notify the supplier and get instructions.

Problem 1 ééméea




- 8 months old
- DTP1, OPV1, Hib1, HepB2
- Breastfeeding
- Looks well but taking antibiotics
- Pregnant household member
@qbilQllcS:
1 What vaccines should I give today?
DTP2, Hib2 (could be administered as combined vaccine),
OPV2, HepBS.
2. Are any of these contraindicated?
No. Breastfeeding is not a contraindication to vaccination. Although the
child has resolving pharyngitis and is taking antibiotics, he is healthy
now and can be vaccinated. A pregnant household contact is not a
contraindication to vaccination.
3. When should Charles come back?
One month (minimum interval between doses of Hib vaccine).
4. What should he receive at the next visit?
DTP3, Hib3 (could be administered as combined vaccine).
OPV3 will NOT be given at this visit, since a minimum of
6 weeks is required between OPV2 and OPV3.



## p. 1164 (#370) ###########################################

Problem 2
- 6 months old
- OPV at birth, and at 4, 8 & 12 weeks
- DTP at 3 & 8 weeks
- "Allergic to penicillin and duck feathers"


€§tlQll§z


1 Which doses should I count?
The ACIP recommends that in the U.S. the minimum age for OPV is
6 weeks, and doses of OPV must be separated by 6 weeks. 80 the
OPV doses at birth and 4 weeks are not counted because the child
was too young, and the dose at 12 weeks is not counted because
it was too close to the prior dose. Only the 8-week dose is counted.
The minimum age for DTP is 6 weeks with 1 month between doses.
80 the dose at 3 weeks is not counted, but the dose at 8 weeks is.
2. What shall I give her today?
DTP2, Hibl (could be administered as combined vaccine), oPv2, HepB1.
3. Are any of these vaccines contraindicated?
Answer; No. Allergies to penicillin or duck feathers do not contraindicate any
vaccines. There are no penicillin or duck feathers in any vaccine
available in the U.S.
4. When should Rose come back, and what vaccines
should she get then?
One month, to receive DTP3, Hib2 (could be administered as
combined vaccine), and HepB2. 0PV3 would be given in a
subsequent visit since 6 weeks should separate doses of OPV.

Problem 3 7mm’;


- 18 months old
- DTP-Hib3, OPV3, HepB2
- 105° fever and febrile seizure following DTP-Hib3
- Immune globulin for measles exposure 3 months ago


I cations;
1 Does Tariq have contraindications to any vaccines?
A high fever and seizure following DTP3 is a precaution, and
additional doses of pertussis vaccine would not usually be given.
Under certain circumstances, if the risk of pertussis were high
(e.g., during a community-wide outbreak of pertussis), it might be
beneficial to give an additional dose of pertussis vaccine. A 5-
month interval is recommended between measles prophylaxis
with IG and administration of MMR vaccine.
2. What vaccines should I give today?
DT4, Hib4, and HepB3.
3. When should Tariq come back, and what vaccines
should he get then?
In 2 months, for MMR. He would not need to return again until school
entry, for DT5, OPV4, and MMR2.

Problem 4
- 20 months old
— Asthma with short-course steroids and inhaler
- Allergic to eggs
- 8 half-doses of DTP
- Hib3 & OPV3


€§tlgll§z


1 How many doses of DTP does Saxon need to complete her series?
Reduced doses of DTP do not count as part of the series, so Saxon
needs a complete 4 or 5 dose series. She should receive a dose of
whole-cell DTP at this visit. DTaP should not be substituted, even
though Saxon is over 15 months of age. DTaP can be used only for
the 4th and 5th doses of the series.
2. What other vaccines does she need now?
Hib4 (could be administered as combined DTP-Hib vaccine), HepB1,
and MMR.
3. Are any of these contraindicated?
No. Short-course and aerosol corticosteroids are not a
contraindication to any vaccine. The egg allergy described
by the mother is not anaphylactic, so egg-containing
vaccines may be used.
4. When should Saxon come back, and what vaccines
will she need then?
Answer: One month, to receive DTP2 (whole cell) and HepB2.

- Sister has epilepsy


l cations.
1 What vaccines does Eizabeth need?
Answer: DTP1, Hib1 (could administer as combined vaccine), HepB1, and
polio vaccine.
2. Are there any contraindications?
OPV is contraindicated for 3 months following immunosuppressive
therapy in a household contact, so Elizabeth should get IPV.
Neither MMR nor any inactivated vaccine is contraindicated because
of the father's immunosuppression. Breastfeeding is not a
contraindication to any vaccine; nor is a family history of epilepsy.
Premature infants should be vaccinated on schedule, based on
their chronologic age.
3. When should she come back, and what should she get then?
in 2 months for DTP2, Hib2 (can be administered as combined
vaccine), HepB2, and OPV. OPV may be given as the second dose
of the series because the father will have been off chemotherapy
for over 3 months.

l estiona
1 What vaccines does Quint need?
MMR1 and HepB3.
2. Are there any contraindications?
AI'lSWeI'I No. Since MMR is not transmitted to household contacts, the father's
immunosuppression does not contraindicate use of MMR in this child.
3. It has been almost 3 years since his last Hepatitis B. Should I
restart the HepB series?
No. Interruption of the series does not require repeating any doses
or restarting the series.

Instruction Sheet - Vaccine Information Materials
{from Federal Register, "New Vaccine Information Materials; Notice," [59 FR 31888], p. 31889, July 20, 1994.}
Required Use
As required under section 2126 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. § 300aa-26),
effective October 1, 1994, all health care providers who administer any vaccine containing
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, or polio vaccine shall, prior to
administration of the vaccine, provide a copy of the relevant vaccine information materials
contained in this notice:
(a) To any adult to whom such provider intends to administer such vaccine, and
(b) To the legal representative of any child to whom such provider intends to administer such
vaccine.
The materials shall be supplemented with visual presentations or oral explanations, in
appropriate cases.
"Legal representative" is deﬁned as a parent or other individual who is qualified under state
law to consent to the immunization of a minor.
Recordkeeping
Health care providers are not required to obtain the signature of the patient, or legal
representative, acknowledging receipt of the vaccine information materials. To ensure that a
record of provision of the materials exists, health care providers shall make a notation in each
patient’s permanent medical record indicating that the vaccine information materials were
provided at the time of the vaccination.
Applicability of State Law
Health care providers should consult their legal counsel to determine additional state
requirements pertaining to immunization. For example, state law determines who is qualified
to consent to immunization of minors. The Federal requirement to provide the vaccine
information materials supplements any applicable state law.

Vaccine Information Materials: Questions and Answers

1Q. Why are there new Vaccine Information Materials (VIMs) for MMR, polio, DTP, and Td?
LA. The new statements are the result of an amendment to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury
Act (NCVIA). The amendment was designed to simplify the vaccine information materials
(VIMs) and the process by which they are developed and revised. The Department of Health and
Human Services proposed legislation to amend section 2126 of the original law based on
concerns expressed by providers and others about the length and readability of the Vaccine
Information Pamphlets (VIPs), and the lengthy development and revision process required by the
rulemaking process. On December 14, 1993, the president signed into law the amendment, which
(1) deletes the requirement for development and revision of the VIMs by rulemaking;
(2) simpliﬁes the information to be included in the materials; and
(3) clariﬁes that the materials must not only be provided to the parent or legal representative of
a child receiving a covered vaccine, but also must be provided to any adult who receives a
covered vaccine.
The information requirements for materials to be given by health care providers to the legal
representatives of any child or to any other individual receiving particular vaccines (i.e., measles,
mumps, rubella, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccines) are now:
(1) a concise description of the beneﬁts of the vaccine;
(2) a concise description of the risks associated with the vaccine;
(3) a statement of the availability of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and
(4) such other relevant information as may be determined by the Secretary.
On January 26, 1994, CDC published draft materials for public comment in the Federal Register
[59 FR 3752]. In addition, CDC has sought input from provider and parent organizations by
meeting with consultants representing the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, Food
and Drug Administration, American Nurses Association, Children’s Defense Fund, March of
Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, National Association of County Health Ofﬁcials, American
Academy of Pediatrics, Ohio Parents for Vaccine Safety, Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies
Coalition, Dissatisﬁed Parents Together, Association of State and Territorial Health Ofﬁcials,
American Osteopathic Pediatricians, and American Academy of Family Physicians.
The VIMs, or Vaccine Information Statements (VISs), were issued as a ﬁnal notice in the
Federal Register on June 20, 1994, [59 FR 31888]. A correction notice was published in the
Federal Register on July 21, 1994 [59 FR 37238]. The July 21 notice corrects grammatical and
typographical errors, and adds materials omitted from the June 20 notice.
2Q. Who has to use the new Vaccine Information Statements (V185), and when must they be in
place?
2A. Beginning October 1, 1994, all public and private providers who administer the vaccines noted
above will be required to use the CDC-developed materials. The NCVIA amendment deleted the
language that allowed providers who buy their own vaccine the ﬂexibility to develop their own
materials. Prior to October 1, 1994, either the VIPs or the new VISs may be used.

Camera-ready copies will be sent to a-ll Immunization Projects, along with explanatory
information. Immunization Projects will be responsible for printing and distributing VISs to their
public health clinics. They will also be asked to print and distribute single camera-ready copies
of each VIS to all providers who administer vaccine in their state or metro area. Funds have
been included in the Immunization Project grants for printing and distribution of the VISs. In
addition, some private provider organizations plan to print and sell copies of the V135.
What does "camera-ready" mean?
The CDC camera-ready copies are printed on high-quality paper, designed to copy well, much
like a master slide or videotape, from which prints or tapes are made. Projects may determine for
themselves what they want to send out as camera-ready.
What happened to the signature blocks on the V185?
Health care providers are p-o-t required to obtain the signature of the patient, parent, or legal
representative, acknowledging receipt of the VISs, or the Important Information Statements (IISs)
(currently available for Haemophilus inﬂuenzae [Hib] and hepatitis B). However, to ensure that a
record of provision of the materials exists, health care providers must make a notation in each
patient’s permanent medical record at the time the V155 are provided. [For providers who obtain
vaccine via federal contract, the CDC Immunization Grant Guidance deﬁnes this as (1) date
printed on the appropriate VIS or IIS and (2) date the VIS-IIS was given to the vaccine recipient
(or the parent or legal representative).
Have other recordkeeping requirements changed?
No. Besides making a notation in each patient’s permanent medical record at the time the VISs
are provided, health care providers who administer a vaccine must still record in each patient’s
permanent medical record, as required by the NCVIA, for each vaccine:
(1) the date of administration of the vaccine
(2) the manufacturer and lot number of the vaccine
(3) the name and address. . . of the health care provider administering the vaccine . . ." (The
address should be the address where the record is kept. If immunizations are given in a
shopping mall, for example, the address would be the clinic where the permanent record will
reside after the provider returns it to the clinic.)
What does "legal representative" mean?
"Legal representative" is defined as a parent or other individual who is qualiﬁed under state law
to consent to the immunization of a minor.

8Q.
Are the VISs considered to be "informed consent"?
8A.
9Q.
9A.
10Q.
10A.
"Informed consent" requirements are determined by state law. The VISs were written to fulﬁll
the information requirements of the amendment to the NCVIA, and are not termed "informed
consent" documents. However, because the materials cover both beneﬁts and risks associated
with vaccines, they provide enough information that anyone reading the materials should be
adequately informed.
Nevertheless, state law should be consulted to determine whether or not there are any speciﬁc
"informed consent" requirements in your state relating to immunization. The requirements could
include procedural and substantive requirements. Procedural requirements include whether
informed consent is required prior to vaccination; whether any required informed consent may be
oral or must be in writing; and whether state law requires a signature prior to vaccination.
Substantive requirements would list the types of information required by the state to be included
in any informed consent.
Whether or not a state requires written informed consent prior to vaccination, all health care
providers are still required to provide the VISs prior to vaccination.
Are the new VISs shorter, and easier to read?
Yes. Each VIS is an 8%" by 11" sheet, printed on both sides. See table below for a comparison
of the VIPs and VISs as to approximate length and reading levels.
Comparison of Grade Reading Levels and Length: 1991 VIPs and 1994 VISs

Td 8th 1,471 7th 519
DTP 8th 2,207 6th 767
Polio 8th 1,804 5th 740
MMR 8th 2,614 5th 769

Have the requirements changed concerning when the materials are to be given?
No. CDC interprets the language of the law ("each health-care provider . . .shall provide . . a
copy of the information materials . . .") to mean EVERY TIME a vaccine is administered, for
several reasons. Between visits, the statements may have been updated, or the health status of the
child may have changed, e.g., he or she may have an evolving neurological disorder. The
statements have information that parents should have at home: the recommended schedule for
the vaccine; what to look for and do after the vaccination; who to call if there is a serious
reaction, etc.

May immunization projects add state or local health department identification to the
VISs?
Yes, appropriate health department identiﬁcation may be added. Any other addition to these
documents or variations from their language or format must have the prior written approval
of the Director, National Immunization Program, CDC.
What about statements for Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b (Hib) and hepatitis B
(hep B)?
Within the year, the existing Important Information Statements (IISs) for Hib and hep B will
be modiﬁed, so that they have the same format as the VISs. Because neither vaccine is
currently covered by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, providers who
buy their own vaccines are not required to use them when administering privately purchased
vaccines. However, because of Duty to Warn clauses required by the manufacturers to be
included in the federal contracts, all providers who administer doses of Hib or hep B
purchased through the federal contracts are required to provide the 118s prior to
administration of those Hib and hep B vaccine doses.
What translations will be available for the VISs, and when will they be available?
CDC will translate the VISs into Chinese, French, Spanish, and Vietnamese. These should
be available before the end of 1994.
May immunization projects or other providers
(a) use the existing translated Vaccine Information Pamphlets (VIPs - dated 10/15/91)
until the V18 translations are available?
(b) translate the VISs into other languages (besides Chinese, French, Spanish, and
Vietnamese)?
(a) Yes, translated VIPs may be used until the V18 translations are available.
(b) Yes, projects or providers may translate the VISs into other languages. These do not
have to be approved by CDC. The California Immunization Program, for instance, is
planning to translate the VISs into 13 languages. These languages are: Armenian,
Cambodian, Chinese Farsi, Hmong, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Portuguese, Russian,
Romanian (Rumanian), Samoan, Tagalog, and Vietnamese.

Why
The new statements are the result of
an amendment to the National Child-
hood- Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA).
The amendment was designed to sim-
plify the vaccine information mate-
rials and the process by which they
are developed and revised.
The Department of Health and Hu-
man Services (HHS) proposed legis-
lation to amend section 2126 of the
original law based on concerns ex-
pressed by providers and others about
the length and readability of the Vac-
cine Information Pamphlets (VIPs)
and the lengthy development and re-
vision process required by the rule
making process.
On December 14, 1993, the presi-
dent signed into law the amendment,
which
> deletes the requirement for de-
velopment and revision of the mate-
rials by rule making;
> simplifies the information to be
included in the materials; and
b clariﬁes that the materials must
not only be provided to the parent or
legal representative of a child receiv-
ing a covered vaccine, but also to
any adult who receives a covered vac-
cine.
A legal representative is deﬁned as
a parent or other individual who is
qualiﬁed under state law to consent
to the immunization of a minor.
Shorter and easier
The revised VISs are designed to be
shorter and easier for the patient or
parent to read and understand and are
more visually attractive. They are
printed on 81/2 by 11 inch white pa-
per, front and back. Where the previ-
ous Vaccine Information Pamphlets
(VIPs) were written at an 8th grade
reading level, the VISs are written at
a 5th-7th grade level of reading com-
prehension.
What and when
The amendment to NCVIA requires
that a specific VIS be given to the le-
gal representatives of any child or to
any other individual every time a par-
ticular vaccine (i.e., measles, mumps,
rubella, poliomyelitis, diphtheria,
tetanus, and pertussis vaccines) is
administered. Each VIS contains the

tary, Health and Human Services.
The NCVIA amendment deleted
the language that allowed providers

Where to get them
Immunization Projects will be re-

sent to all Immunization Projects,
along with explanatory information.
They will also be asked to print and

Signatures and record keeping
Beginning October 1, 1994, health
care providers are no longer required
to obtain the signature of the patient,
parent, or child's legal representa-
tive, to acknowledge receipt of the
VISs.
Providers must make a notation in
each patient’s permanent medical
record indicating the V185 were pro-
vided at the time of vaccination. In
addition, health care providers who
administer a vaccine must still record
in each patient’s permanent medical
record, as required by the NCVIA,
for each vaccine:
> the date of administration of the
vaccine;
> the manufacturer and lot num-
ber of the vaccine; and
> the name and business address
(where the patient’s records are kept)
of the health care provider adminis-
tering the vaccine.
Foreign language translations
CDC will translate the VISs into Chi-
nese, French, Spanish, and Vietnam-
ese. These should be available before
the end of 1994. Translated Vaccine
Information Pamphlets may be used
in the interim.
Hib, hepatitis B, and DTP/Hib
Within the year, the existing Impor-
tant Information Statements (IISs)
for Hib and hepatitis B vaccines will
be modified, so that they have the
same format as the VISs. Because
neither vaccine is currently covered
by the National Vaccine Injury Com-
pensation Program, providers who
buy their own vaccines are not re-
quired to use them when administer-
ing privately purchased vaccines.
However, because of Duty to Warn
clauses required by the manufactur-
ers to be included in the federal con-
tracts, all providers who administer
doses of Hib or hep B purchased
through the federal contracts are re-
quired to provide the 118s prior to
administration of doses of Hib and
hepatitis B vaccine.
Work on a DTP/Hib VIS will be-
gin once the Hib and hepatitis B
statements are completed. For now1
the DTP VIS and the Hib 118 should
be distributed each time a combina-
tion DTP/Hib vaccineis administered

TETANUS
ABOUT THE DISEASES
AND
DIPHTHERIA
VACCINE
(Td)
Tetanus (lockjaw) and diph-
theria are serious diseases.
Tetanus is caused by a germ
that enters the body through
a cut or wound. Diphtheria
spreads when germs pass
from an infected person to
the nose or throat of others.


What you need to
know before you or
your child gets the
vaccine

Tetanus causes:
serious, painful spasms
of all muscles
it can lead to:
- “locking" of the jaw so
the patient cannot
open his or her mouth
or swallow
- death


Diphtheria causes:
a thick coating in the
nose, throat, or airway
it can lead to:
- breathing problems
- heart failure
- paralysis
- death


ABOUT THE VACCINES
Benefits of the vaccines
Vaccination is the best way
to protect against tetanus
and diphtheria. Because of
vaccination, there are many
fewer cases of these dis-
eases. Cases are rare in chil-
dren because most get DTP
(Diphtheria, Tetanus, and
Pertussis), DTaP (Diphtheria,
Tetanus, and acellular
Pertussis), or DT (Diphtheria
and Tetanus) vaccines. There
would be many more cases if
we stopped vaccinating
people.
when should you get
Td vaccine?
Td is made for people 7 years
of age and older.
People who have not gotten
at least 3 doses of any
tetanus and diphtheria vac-
cine (DTP, DTaP, or DT) during
their lifetime should do so
using Td. After a person gets
the third dose, a Td dose is
needed every 10 years all
through life.
Other vaccines may be
given at the same time as Td.
Tell your doctor or nurse if the
person getting the vaccine:
- ever had a serious allergic
reaction or other problem
with Td, or any other
tetanus and diphtheria
vaccine (DTP, DTaP, or DT)
now has a moderate or
severe illness
- is pregnant
If you are not sure, ask your
doctor or nurse.
What are the risks from
Td vaccine?
As with any medicine, there
are very small risks that
serious problems, even
death, could occur after get-
ting a vaccine.
The risks from the vaccine are
mggh smaller than the risks
from the diseases if people
stopped using vaccine.
Almost all people who get id
have no problems from it.

Mild problems
What to do it there is a serious reaction:
If These problems occur, they usually start within
hours to a day or two after vaccination. They
may last l-2 days:
- soreness. redness. or swelling where the shot
was given
These problems can be worse in adults who get
Td vaccine very often.
Acetaminophen or ibuprofen (non-aspirin) may
be used to reduce soreness.
Severe problems
These problems happen very rarely:
- serious allergic reaction
- deep, aching pain and muscle wasting in
upper arm(s). This starts 2 days to 4 weeks after
the shot, and may lost many months.

DTaP (Diphtheria Ietanus
gcellular Pertussis)
- Like DTP, it prevents
diphtheria, tetanus, and
pertussis.
' It is only given for the 4th
and 5th doses.
' It is less likely to cause the
mild problems we see
after DTP and is probably
less likely to cause some
of the moderate prob-
lems.
DT (Diphtheria Ietanus)
- Unlike DTP. it does not
prevent pertussis. For this
reason, it is usually not
recommended.


## p. 1182 (#388) ###########################################

Who should get DTP vaccine?
Moderate problems
Most doctors recommend that almost all young
children get DTP or DTaP vaccine. Some children
should get DT. With all vaccines, there are some
cautions.
Tell your doctor or nurse if the child getting the
vaccine:
' ever had a serious allergic reaction or other
problem after getting DTP, DTaP, or DT
' now has moderate or severe illness
- has ever had a seizure
- has a parent, brother, or sister who has had
seizures
' has a brain problem that is getting worse
if you are not sure, ask your doctor or nurse.
What are the risks from these vaccines?
As with any medicine, there are very small risks
that serious problems. even death. could occur
after getting a vaccine.
The risks from the vaccine are much smaller than
the risks from the diseases if people stopped using
vaccine.
Below is a list of problems that may occur after
getting the vaccine. If your child ever had one of
the moderate or severe problems listed below or
any other serious problem after DTP, DTaP, or DT,
discuss it with your doctor or nurse before this
vaccination.
Mild problems
If these problems occur, they usually start within
hours to a day or two after vaccination. They
usually last up to i-2 days:
' soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot
was given
' fever
- fussiness, drowsiness, less appetite
Acetaminophen or ibuprofen (non-aspirin) may
be used to prevent or reduce fever and soreness.
This is especially important for children who have
had seizures or have a parent, brother, or sister
who has had seizures.
DTP 0/10/94
42 U.S.C. § 30000-26
Once for every TOO-1,000 doses:
- on-going crying for 3 hours or more
- fever of 105° or higher
' an unusual, high-pitched cry
Once for every 1,750 doses:
0 a seizure (jerking and staring spell) usually
caused by fever
- “shock-collapse" (becomes pale, limp, and
less alert)
Severe problems
These problems happen very rarely:
' serious allergic reaction after DT or DTP
' a long seizure
' decreased consciousness or coma. Some of
these children may have lasting brain damage.
There is disagreement about whether or not
DTP causes the lasting brain damage. if it does,
it is very rare.

' People with a serious allergy to eggs or the
drug neomycin should tell the doctor or nurse.
If you are not sure, ask the doctor or nurse.
Tell your doctor or nurse if the person getting the
vaccine:
- ever had a serious allergic reaction or other
problem after getting MMR
- now has moderate or severe illness
' has ever had a seizure
' has a parent, brother, or sister who has had
seizures
' has gotten immune globulin or other blood
products (such as a transfusion) during the
past several months
If you are not sure, ask your doctor or nurse
What are the risks from MMR vaccine?
As with any medicine, there are very small risks
that serious problems, even death, could occur
after taking a vaccine.
The risks from the vaccine are much smaller than
the risks from the diseases if people stopped
using vaccine.
Almost all people who get MMR have no prob-
lems from it.
Mild or moderate problems
- Soon after the vaccination, there may be
soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot
was given.
- l-2 weeks after the first dose, there may be:
- rash (5-15 out of every 100 doses)
- fever of 103° or higher (5-15 out of every
100 doses). This usually lasts l-2 days.
- swelling of the glands in the cheeks, neck,
or under the jaw
- a seizure (jerking and staring spell) usually
caused by fever. This is rare.
- l-3 weeks after the ﬁrst dose, there may be:
- pain, stiffness, or swelling in one or more
joints lasting up to 3 days (i out of every
100 doses in children; up to 40 out of every
100 doses in young women). Rarely, pain
or stiffness lasts a month or longer, or may
come and go; this is most common in
young and adult women.
MMR 6/10/94
42 U.S.C. § 30000-26
Acetaminophen or ibuprofen (non-aspirin) may
be used to reduce fever and soreness.
Severe problems
These problems happen very rarely:
- serious allergic reaction
- low number of platelets (a type of blood cell)
that can lead to bleeding problems. This is
almost always temporary.
- long seizures, decreased consciousness, or
coma
Problems following MMR are much less common
after the second dose.
What to do if there is a serious reaction:

Polio is a serious disease. It
spreads when germs pass
from an infected person to
the mouths of others. Polio
can:
- paralyze a person (make
arms and legs unable to
move)
' cause death
ABOUT THE VACCINES
Benefits of the vaccines
Vaccination is the best way to
protect against polio.
Because most children get
the polio vaccines, there are
now very few cases of this dis-
ease. Before most children
were vaccinated, there were
thousands of cases of polio.
There are 2 kinds of polio
vaccine
()PV or Qral Eolio Vaccine is
the one most often given to
children. It is given by mouth
as drops. it is easy to give and
works well to stop the spread
of polio.
IPV or inactivated Eolio
Vaccine is given as a shot in
the leg or arm.
OPV schedule
Most children should have a
total of 4 OPV vaccines. They
should have OPV at:
v 2 months of age
s/ 4 months of age
v é-l 8 months of age
/ 4-6 years of age
Other vaccines may be given
at the same time as OPV.
Most doctors recommend
that almost all young children
get OPV. But there are some
cautions. Tell your doctor or
nurse if the person getting the
vaccine or anyone else in
close contact with the person
getting the vaccine is less
able to fight serious infections
because of:
' a disease she-he was born
with
' treatment with drugs such
as long-term steroids
' any kind of cancer
' cancer treatment with
x-rays or drugs
' AIDS or HIV infection
If so, your doctor or nurse will
probably give lPV instead of
OPV.
If you are older than age l8
years, you usually do not
need polio vaccine.
Travel
If you are traveling to a coun-
try where there is polio, you
should get either OPV or IPV.
Beam!
If protection is needed during
pregnancy, OPV or IPV can
be used.
Allergy to neomycin or
streptomycin
Does the person getting the
vaccine have an allergy to
the drugs neomycin or
streptomycin’? If so, she-he
should get OPV, but not lPV.
Ask your doctor or nurse if you
are not sure.

Measles, rubella rates increase over '93

diseases to the National Notiﬁable Diseases Surveillance
System for the ﬁrst 6 months of 1994 are now in. Dur-
ing this interval, the incidence of measles increased over 3-fold,
and that of rubella by 65%, over ﬁnal total cases of these
diseases reported for the same period in 1993.
PROVISIONAL DATA FOR REPORTING OF VACCINE PREVENTABLE
Measles
The increase in measles was due to large outbreaks in popula-
tions which reject vaccination (Christian Scientists in Missouri
and Illinois and certain groups in Utah and Nevada), and smaller
outbreaks among college students (New Jersey), secondary
school students (Tennessee, West Virginia, and California), and
preschool children (New Jersey). In addition, a large measles
outbreak Occurred in Guam among predominantly unvaccinated
preschool children.
Rubella
Approximately 65% of rubella cases have occurred in an
extended outbreak among unvaccinated adults in Massachusetts.
Since June 30, all reported measles and rubella outbreaks have
ceased, and only limited numbers of sporadic or imported cases
are now being reported.
Pertussis, hepatitis B, and tetanus
Reported numbers of cases of pertussis, hepatitis B and tetanus
cases have been comparable to the same period of 1993. Although
the pertussis incidence during the ﬁrst half of 1994 is similar
to the 25-year record high of 1993, since June 30, the reported
pertussis incidence appears to have decreased compared to that in
1993, suggesting this year’s late summer-fall peak season will be
less severe than 1993.
Mumps
Reported cases of mumps are 23% lower than in the same period
for 1993. Mumps incidence has continued to decrease from its

Vaccine preventable disease surveillance results
) continued from Page 3
most recent peak in 1989 (5,712 cases reported); incidence for the
ﬁrst half of 1994 is only 23% of that observed for this period in
1989. This sustained decrease is likely due to both more complete
implementation of comprehensive school laws requiring students
to have received at least one dose of mumps vaccine, and
implementation of the 1989 ACIP recommendations that school
enterers (primary or middle-school) receive two doses of MMR
vaccine.
Haemophilus influenza
Reported cases of invasive Haemophilus inﬂuenzae (Hi) disease
are 11% lower than in the same period for 1993. The decrease is
focused primarily in children less than 5 years of age (21%
decrease), as would be expected with increased implementation
of universal vaccination of infants with conjugate Haemophilus
inﬂuenzae type b vaccine, ﬁrst recommended in October, 1990.
Coverage of 19-35 month old children with three or more doses
of Hib vaccine reached 60% by the third quarter of 1993 (see
MMWR 1994 August 5).
More on Haemophilus influenza
The continued reporting of modest numbers of cases of invasive
Hi disease in both children and adults does not accurately
represent the incidence of Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b (Hib)
disease in the United States. Because of the impact of Hib
conjugate vaccines, which prevent only Hib disease and not that
due to other serotypes of Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, Hib disease
now represents only a small minority of all invasive H. inﬂuenzae
disease occurring in the United States. Based on data from active

surveillance in four states in 1993, Hib disease represented only
30% of all invasive H. inﬂuenzae disease in children under 5
years, and only 10% of such disease in persons older than this
age. This represents a dramatic change from the pre-Hib-vaccine
era, when most invasive H. inﬂuenzae occurred in children less
than 5 years of age, over 80% of which was due to Hib disease.
To better track progress toward the 1996 goal of eliminating
Hib disease among children under 5 years of age, additional
information must be collected and reported for all cases of
invasive H. inﬂuenzae disease in children under 15 years of age.
This information includes serotype of the H. inﬂuenzae isolate
(type b or non-b) and vaccination status of the child. Of the 46
states that reported cases among children in 1993, only 27
included information on H. inﬂuenzae serotype. Among these
states, most did not report serotype information on every case.
This and other supplementary information should be reported on
the National Bacterial Meningitis and Bacteremia Case Report
form, and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
National Center for Infectious Diseases, Childhood and Respira-
tory Disease Branch, Mailstop G09, 1600 Clifton Road N.E.,
Atlanta, Georgia, 30333. Alternatively, a supplemental data entry
screen for reports of this information is available on the National
Electronic Telecommunications Surveillance System (NETSS).
All state and local health departments are encouraged to ensure
appropriate serotype testing is done on each H. inﬂuenzae isolate
and that these results are reported to CDC.

NAI'IDNAl VACCINE INJURY
COMPENSATION PROGRAM
Congress enacted the National Vaccine Injury
Compensation Program (VICP) as a no-fault alternative
to the tort system for resolving claims resulting from
adverse reactions to mandated childhood vaccines. The
VICP has received over 5,000 claims since its effective
date of October 1, 1988, 85 percent of which are for
vaccines administered prior to the effective date
(retrospective claims). Now in its 8th year of operation,
the Program has achieved its policy goals of liability
protection and vaccine price stabilization.
Over the past several years, media articles on the VICP
may have created misperceptions and uncertainty
regarding the Program's future ability to operate
successfully as a critical part of our National
Immunization Program. These are the facts:
0 Lawsuits against DTP manufacturers have decreased
dramatically since the legislation went into effect in
1988 (see graph). Lawsuits against physicians and
other health care providers also have decreased,
although the numbers are not reported.

- Claimants have the option to file vaccine injury
lawsuits against physicians who administer vaccines
and vaccine manufacturers only after their claim is
adjudicated under the VICP and the judgment is
rejected. However, VICP data shows that this occurs
in only a very small percentage of the cases. Out of
2,199 vaccine injury claims adjudicated to date, only
66 claimants have filed motions to reject the
judgment, thus preserving their right to ﬁle a lawsuit
in the future. Of the 218 claims adjudicated for
vaccines given after the effective date of the VICP
(prospective claims), only 11 have rejected the
judgment. Overall, only two rejections were claimants
who were awarded compensation. Furthermore, it is
rare for a vaccine injury case adjudicated under the
VICP to later receive a judgment against or a
settlement from a vaccine manufacturer or
administrator in the tort system.
Q A 1994 Periodic Survey of Fellows study conducted
by the Department of Research, American Academy of
Pediatrics, indicates that concerns about immunization
liability are low among pediatricians. The survey drew
responses from 1,246 practitioners randomly selected
across the U.S. When asked why they refer patients
out for immunization, liability was second to last on a
list of ten possibilities ranging from vaccine cost to
patient preference. The results are consistent across
various practice settings (solo, group, or clinic
practice) and practice locations (rural to large
metropolitan areas).
The ~l/lCP is continuing to protect vaccine administrators
and manufacturers against the liability threat once
experienced in this country. Practitioners everywhere
can and should continue to promote immunization as
this Nation's most successful public health measure with
full conﬁdence that liability protection is maximized by
the success of the VICP.

VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM
PRE-1988 PROGRAM
(Legislative Deadline for Filing Claims Expired January 31, 1991)
Program Description
The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)
is a no-fault alternative to the tort system for resolving
claims resulting from adverse reactions to covered vac-
cines. Vaccines covered by the Act include diphtheria,
tetanus, pertussis (DTP, DT, TT, or Td); measles,
mumps, rubella (MMR or any components); and polio
(OPV or IPV). The VICP is administered jointly by the
United States Court of Federal Claims (the Court), the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and
the Department of Justice (DOJ). An individual claiming
injury or death from a vaccine files a petition for com-
pensation with the Court. A physician at the Division of
Vaccine Injury Compensation, HHS, reviews each peti-
tion to determine whether it meets the criteria for com-
pensation and makes a recommendation in the form of
a respondent's report that is filed with the Court by DOJ.
There are two means to qualify for compensation:
(1) a petitioner must prove that the vaccine caused the
injury, or (2) a petitioner must prove that an injury listed
on the Vaccine Injury Table, as set forth in the Act,
occurred within the speciﬁed time periods.
The Act distinguishes in terms of the date of vacci-
nation, the elements of compensation, source of funds,
and court processing time between vaccines adminis-
tered prior to October 1, 1988 (pro-1988 claims), and
those administered on or after this date (post-1988
claims). The deadline for filing pre-1988 claims under
the program expired on January 31, 1991. This fact
sheet provides general information relevant to all claims
and specific information on pro-1988 claims.
Elements of Compensation for Pre-1988 Claims
For death-related claims, the total benefit allowed
by law is $250,000. In injury claims, the amount of
compensation is determined by the Court based on the
needs of the individual and the extent of the injury. The
award may include future non-reimbursable medical,
residential, custodial-end rehabilitation expenses not
otherwise covered by a third-party payor. In addition, up
to a total of $30,000 for pre-1 988 claims may be awarded
for lost earnings, pain and suffering, and reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs.
Adjudication
Petitions for compensation are adjudicated by the
Court, and the Secretary of HHS is named as the re-
spondent. Attorneys from DOJ represent HHS in hear-
ings before a “Special Master", appointed by the Court,
who makes the initial decision on the petition for com-
pensation. Either party may file an objection to the
decision of a Special Master and request review by the
Court. Appeals of judgments by the Court are heard by
the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.
The responsibility for determining the order in which
petitions will be heard lies with the Court. The Court is
now seeking input from HHS on whether cases are
sufficiently documented to proceed to full review; the
intial review is based on the assignment of cases by the
Court, generally in the order received by the Court, as
reflected by the Court's docket numbers. For additional
information pertaining to how claims are scheduled to
be heard, an individual may write to the Clerk of the
United States Court of Federal Claims, 717 Madison
Place, N.W., Washington, DC. 20005, or call (202) 219-
9657.
The Court has approximately 44 months from the
date a petition is ﬁled to render a decision on pre-1988
claims, including all available suspension time. After the
deadline has passed, the Court may retain jurisdiction
over a petition with the consent of the petitioners.

those administered on or after this date (post-1988
claims). This fact sheet provides general information
relevant to all claims and specific information on post-
1988 claims.
Filing Claims
For post-1 988 claims involving an injury, the effects
must have continued for at least 6 months after vaccine
administration and the claim must be filed within 36
months after the first symptom appeared. For post-1988
claims involving a death, the claim must be filed within
24 months of the death and within 48 months after the
onset of the vaccine-related injury from which the death
occurred.
Elements of Compensation
for Post-1988 Claims
For death-related claims, the total benefit allowed
by law is $250,000. in injury claims, the amount of
compensation is determined by the Court based on the
needs of the individual and the extent of the injury. The
award may include past and future non-reimbursable
medical, residential, custodial and rehabilitation ex-

COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT
THE NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM
What is the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)?
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (the Act) established the VICP.
This Program went into effect in October 1988 and is a Federal "no-fault" system
designed to compensate those individuals, or families of individuals, who have been
injured by childhood vaccines, whether administered in the private or public sector.
What vaccines are covered?
Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP, DTaP, DT, TT, or Td), measles, mumps,
rubella (MMR or any components), and polio (OPV or IPV).
Who may ﬁle a claim?
A claim may be made for any injury or death thought to be a result of a covered
vaccine. These injuries may include, but are not limited to: anaphylaxis, paralytic
polio, and encephalopathy. The injured individual may ﬁle; or a parent, legal
guardian, or trustee may ﬁle on behalf of a child or an incapacitated person.
What is the time frame in which to file a claim?
For injuries resulting from a vaccine administered on or after October 1, 1988, the
following restrictions apply:
a. In the case of an injm, the effects must have continued at least 6 months
after vaccine administration and the claim must be ﬁled within 36 months
after the ﬁrst symptoms appeared.
b. In the case of a death, the claim must be ﬁled within 24 months of the death
and within 48 months after the onset of the vaccine-related injury from which
the death occurred.
The time for ﬁling claims for injuries resulting from vaccines administered prior to
October 1, 1988, has expired. Any claims ﬁled for that time period are subject to
dismissal by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (the Court).

5. Who can I contact to get more information about the Program?
The toll-free number for the National Vaccine Injgry Compensation Program
is 1-800-338-2382 to obtain an information packet detailing how to ﬁle a
claim, criteria for eligibility, and the documentation required. For further
information write to:
National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program
Parklawn Building, Room 8A-35
5600 Fishers Lane
Rockville, Maryland 20857
For information on the rules of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims including
requirements for ﬁling a petition, call 1-202-219-9657 or write to:

U.S. Court of Federal Claims
717 Madison Place, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20005
How is the VICP funded?
Funding of vaccine claims depends on the date of vaccination:
a.
For vaccines administered prior to October 1. 1988. awards are compensated
from Federal tax dollars allocated by Congress at $110 million per year.
For vaccines administered on or after October 1. 1988, awards are paid from
the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund, funded from an excise tax on
every dose of covered vaccine that is purchased.
7. How does the VICP work?
The Program is administered jointly by the Court, the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Justice (DOJ). The process is as
follows:
a.
An individual claiming injury from a vaccine ﬁles a petition for
compensation with the Court;
A physician at the Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation, HHS, reviews
each petition to determine whether it meets the criteria for compensation.
This recommendation is provided to the Court through a report ﬁled by the
DOJ, although it is not binding.


## p. 1201 (#407) ###########################################

c. The HHS position is represented by an attorney from the DO] in hearings
before a "special master" who makes the initial decision for compensation
under the Program. A special master is an attorney appointed by the judges
of the Court.
d. Decisions may be appealed to the Court and then to the Federal Circuit Court
of Appeals.
How is eligibility for compensation determined?
There are three means to qualify for compensation:
a. A petitioner must show that an injury found on the Vaccine Injury Table
occurred (See Table 1); or
b. A petitioner must prove that the vaccine caused the condition; or
c. A petitioner must prove that the vaccine signiﬁcantly aggravated a
pre-existing condition.
The Vaccine Injury Table lists speciﬁc injuries or conditions and the time frames in
which they must occur after vaccine administration. The Table is a legal mechanism
for deﬁning complex medical conditions and allows a statutory "presumption of
causation." It is much easier to demonstrate a "Table Injury" than to prove that the
vaccine caused the condition, and most claims allege that a Table Injury occurred.
Compensation is not awarded, however, if the Court determines that the injury or
death was due to a cause unrelated to the vaccine, even if it was a Table Injury.
In contrast to civil liability suits, hearings to determine eligibility under the VICP
usually last only I or 2 days. A case found eligible for compensation is scheduled
for a hearing to assess the amount of compensation. Most claims found to be
noncompensable receive awards for attorney's fees and costs.
How many claims have been received by the Program and which vaccines are
most commonly involved?
As of August 25, 1995, a total of 4,980 petitions have been ﬁled. The breakdown
by vaccine is as follows:
DTP or components: 74% MMR or components: 14%
IPV or OPV: 10% Other“: 2%
*Vaccines not covered under the Program or unspeciﬁed vaccines.


## p. 1202 (#408) ###########################################

10.
What is the amount of an award under the VICP?
11.
12.
13.
Awards to the estate in a vaccine-related m are limited to $250,000 plus
attorney’s fees and costs. Awards to individuals with an injm judged to be
vaccine-related have averaged $1 million, although this amount typically represents
the cost of an annuity that pays out signiﬁcantly more over the life of the petitioner.
There is no limitation as such on the amount of an award in a vaccine-related injury;
however, the law does contain certain restrictions.
How does the VICP protect vaccine administrators and vaccine manufacturers?
a. For vaccine administrators and manufacturers: The Act requires that vaccine
injury claims involving covered vaccines given on or after October 1, 1988,
must ﬁrst be ﬁled with the VICP before civil litigation through the tort
system can be pursued. If a petitioner accepts an award under the VICP, the
claim cannot be brougm subsequently to the tort system.
b. For vaccine manufacturers: In addition to the above, the legislation sets new,
more restrictive standards for actions alleging injury from these covered
vaccines in cases that are brought to the tort system.
Under what circumstances may a vaccine administrator or manufacturer be
sued?
a. If the petition has been judged non-compensable or dismissed under the
VICP, or
b. If the award granted by the VICP is otherwise rejected by the petitioner, or
c. If the vaccine is not covered under the VICP.
Are hepatitis B, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b, and varicella vaccines covered
under the VICP? How are new vaccines added for coverage under the
Program?
At present, hepatitis B and Haemophilus inﬂuenzae type b vaccines are not covered
under the VICP. The coverage of additional vaccines to the VICP currently requires
both rulemaking by HHS to add new vaccines to the Table and legislation by
Congress to enact an excise tax. Proposals are under consideration to streamline this
process from the current 3 to 4 years to a few months, providing expeditious
coverage of the above vaccines, and any new vaccine recommended by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for routine administration to children.
Under the current statutory language, 8 years’ retroactive coverage would be
provided for those claiming injury or death resulting from a vaccine newly added to
the Program.


## p. 1203 (#409) ###########################################

14.
Have there been changes to the Vaccine Injury Table?
15.
16.
On March 10, 1995, a modiﬁed Vaccine Injury Table (and the accompanying
Qualiﬁcations and Aids to Interpretation) became effective for all claims ﬁled on or
after that date. Signiﬁcant changes include the addition of chronic arthritis under
vaccines containing rubella (e.g., MMR, MR, R vaccines), and the removal of
Residual Seizure Disorder and Hypotonic-Hyporesponsive Episode (HHE) under the
DTP vaccine. The deﬁnition of Encephalopathy was clariﬁed in the Qualiﬁcations
and Aids to Interpretation. A copy of the "new" Table is attached as Table 1.
What documentation are vaccine administrators required to keep?
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires that the date of administration;
vaccine manufacturer; lot number; and name, address, and title of the health care‘
provider be recorded in the patient’s permanent medical record.
What adverse events are health care providers required to report?
The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), operated by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC, should be notiﬁed of any adverse
event by completing a VAERS reporting form. The following events are required to
be reported:
a. Any event set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table that occurs within the time
period speciﬁed or within 7 days, if that is longer.
b. Any contraindicating event listed in the manufacturer’s package insert.
In addition, VAERS accepts g1 reports by any interested party of real or suspected
adverse events occurring after the administration of ai vaccine.
The VAERS form may be obtained by calling l-800-822-7967.

(b) Qua_;_liﬁcatio and aidi to interpretation The following qualiﬁcations and aids to interpretation shall apply to the Vaccine Injury Table (the Table):
(l) Anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. For purposes of the Table, Anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock mean an acute, severe, and potentially lethal systemic allergic
reaction. Most cases resolve without sequelae. Signs and symptoms begin minutes to a few hours after exposure. Death, if it occurs, usually results from airway
obstruction caused by laryngeal edema or bronchospasm and may be associated with cardiovascular collapse. Other signiﬁcant clinical signs and symptoms may include
the following: Cyanosis, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, edema of the pharynx and-or trachea and-or larynx with stridor and dyspnea. Autopsy
ﬁndings may include acute emphysema which results from lower respiratory tract obstruction, edema of the hypopharynx, epiglottis, larynx, or trachea and minimal
ﬁndings of eosinophilia in the liver, spleen and lungs. When death occurs within minutes of exposure and without signs of respiratory distress, there may not be signiﬁcant
pathologic ﬁndings.
(2) Encephalopathy. For purposes of the Table, a vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered an encephalopathy only if such recipient manifests, within the
applicable period, an injury meeting the description below of an acute encephalopathy, and then a chronic encephalopathy persists in such person for more than 6 months
beyond the date of vaccination.


## p. 1206 (#412) ###########################################

(i) An acute encephalopathy is one that is sufficiently severe so as to require hospitalization.
(A) For children less than 18 months of age who present without an associated seizure event, an acute encephalopathy is indicated by a signiﬁcantly decre:
level of consciousness lasting for at least 24 hours. Those children less than 18 months of age who present following a seizure shall be viewed as having an acute
encephalopathy if their signiﬁcantly decreased level of consciousness persists beyond 24 hours and cannot be attributed to a postictal state (seizure) or medication.
(13) For adults and children 18 months of age or older, an acute encephalopathy is one that persists for at least 24 hours and characterized by at least two
the following:
(I) A signiﬁcant change in mental status that is not medication related; speciﬁcally a confusional state, or a delirium, or a psychosis;
(2) A signiﬁcantly decreased level of consciousness, which is independent of a seizure and cannot be attributed to the effects of medication; and
(3) A seizure associated with loss of consciousness.
(C) Increased intracranial pressure may be a clinical feature of acute encephalopathy in any age group.
(D) A "signiﬁcantly decreased level of consciousness" is indicated by the presence of at least one of the following clinical signs for at least 24 hours or
greater (see paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section for applicable timeframes):
(I) Decreased or absent response to environment (responds, if at all, only to loud voice or painful stimuli);
(2) Decreased or absent eye contact (does not ﬁx gaze upon family members or other individuals); or
(3) Inconsistent or absent responses to external stimuli (does not recognize familiar people or things).
(E) The following clinical features alone, or in combination, do not demonstrate an acute encephalopathy or a signiﬁcant change in either mental status or
level of consciousness as described above: Sleepiness, irritability (fussiness), high-pitched and unusual screaming, persistent inconsolable crying, and bulging fontanell
Seizures in themselves are not sufﬁcient to constitute a diagnosis of encephalopathy. In the absence of other evidence of an acute encephalopathy, seizures shall not be
viewed as the ﬁrst symptom or manifestation of the onset of an acute encephalopathy.
(ii) Chronic Encephalopathy occurs when a change in mental or neurologic status, ﬁrst manifested during the applicable time period, persists for a period 01
least 6 months from the date of vaccination. Individuals who retum to a normal neurologic state after the acute encephalopathy shall not be presumed to have suffered
residual neurologic damage from that event; any subsequent chronic encephalopathy shall not be presumed to be a sequela of the acute encephalopathy. If a preponderi
of the evidence indicates that a child’s chronic encephalopathy is secondary to genetic, prenatal or perinatal factors, that chronic encephalopathy shall not be consideret
be a condition set forth in the Table.
(iii) An encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table if in a proceeding on a petition, it is shown by a preponderance of ti
evidence that the encephalopathy was caused by an infection, a toxin, a metabolic disturbance, a structural lesion, a genetic disorder or trauma (without regard to wheti
the cause of the infection, toxin, trauma, metabolic disturbance, structural lesion or genetic disorder is known). If at the time a decision is made on a petition ﬁled unc
section 2111(b) of the Act for a vaccine-related injury or death, it is not possible to determine the cause by a preponderance of the evidence of an encephalopathy,
the encephalopathy shall be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table.
(iv) In determining whether or not an encephalopathy is a condition set forth in the Table, the Court shall consider the entire medical record.
(3) Residual Seizure Disorder.
(i) A petitioner may be considered to have suffered a residual seizure disorder for purposes of the Table, if the ﬁrst seizure or convulsion occurred 5-15 (13]
(not less than 5 days and not more than 15 days) after administration of the vaccine and 2 or more additional distinct seizure or convulsion episodes occurred within 1 3
after the administration of the vaccine which were unaccompanied by fever (deﬁned as a rectal temperature equal to or greater than 101.0 degrees Fahrenheit or an out
temperature equal to or greater than 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit). A distinct seizure or convulsion episode is ordinarily deﬁned as including all seizure or convulsive acti
occurring within a 24-hour period, unless competent and qualiﬁed expert neurological testimony is presented to the contrary in a particular case.
(ii) For purposes of the Table, 2 petitioner shall not be considered to have suffered a residual seizure disorder, if the petitioner suffered a seizure or convul:
unaccompanied by fever (deﬁned as a rectal temperature equal to or greater than 101.0 degrees Fahrenheit or an oral temperature equal to or greater than 100.0 degree
Fahrenheit) before the ﬁfth day after the administration of the vaccine involved.
(4) Seizure and convulsion. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, the terms, "seizure" and “convulsion” include myoclonic, generalized tonic-ck
(grand mal), and simple and complex partial seizures. Absence (petit mal) seizures shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. Jerking movemcnti
staring episodes alone are not necessarily an indication of seizure activity.
(5) Seguela. The term "sequela" means a condition or event which was actually caused by a condition listed in the Vaccine Injury Table.
(6) Chronic Arthritis.
(i) For purposes of the Table, chronic arthritis may be found in a person with no prior history of arthropathy (joint disease) on the basis of:
(A) Medical documentation, recorded within 30 days after the onset, of objective signs of acute arthritis (joint swelling) that occurred within 42 days after
rubella vaccination; and
(B) Medical documentation (recorded within 3 years after the onset of acute arthritis) of the persistence of objective signs of intermittent or continuous

arthritis for more than 6 months following vaccination.
(ii) For purposes of the Table, the following shall not be considered as chronic arthritis: Musculoskeletal disorders such as diffuse connective tissue diseases
(including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease,
polymyositis/dermatomyositis, necrotizing vasculitis and vasculopathics and Sjogren’s Syndrome), degenerative joint disease, infectious agents other than rubella (wheti
by direct invasion or as an immune reaction), metabolic and endocrine diseases, trauma, neoplasms, neuropathic disorders, bone and cartilage disorders and arthritis
associated with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, inﬂammatory bowel disease, Reiter’s syndrome, or blood disorders.
(iii) Arthralgia (joint pain) or stiffness without joint swelling shall not be viewed as chronic arthritis for purposes of the Table.

DIRECTIONS FOR COMPLETING FORM
(Additional pages may be attached if more space is needed.)
GENERAL
Use a separate form for each patient. Complete the form to the best of your abilities. Items 3,4, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 13 are considered
essential and should be completed whenever possible. Parents-Guardians may need to consult the facility where the vaccine was
administered for some of the information (such as manufacturer, lot number or laboratory data.)
Refer to the Vaccine Injury Table (VIT) for events mandated for reporting by law. Reporting for other serious events felt to be related
but not on the VlT is encouraged.
Health care providers other than the vaccine administrator (VA) treating a patient for a suspected adverse event should notify the
VA and provide the information about the adverse event to allow the VA to complete the form to meet the VA’s legal responsibility.
These data will be used to increase understanding of adverse events following vaccination and will become part of CDC Privacy
Act System 09-20-0136, “Epidemiologic Studies and Surveillance of Disease Problems”. information identifying the person who
received the vaccine orthat person’s legal representative will not be made available to the public, but may be available to the vaccinee
or legal representative.
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
Form Completed By: To be used by parents-guardians, vaccine manutacturers/distributors, vaccine administrators, and-or the person
completing the form on behalf of the patient or the health professional who administered the vaccine.
Item 7: Describe the suspected adverse event. Such things as temperature, local and general signs and symptoms, time course,
duration of symptoms diagnosis, treatment and recovery should be noted.
item 9: Check “YES" if the patients health condition is the same as it was prior to the vaccine, “NO" if the patient has not returned
to the pre-vaccination state of health, or “UNKNOWN" if the patient’s condition is not known.
item 10: Give dates and times as specifically as you can remember. If you do not know the exact time, please
and 11 : indicate “AM” or “PM" when possible if this information is known. If more than one adverse event, give the onset date and
time for the most serious event.
Item 12: Include “negative” or “normal” results of any relevant tests performed as well as abnormal findings.
item 13: List ONLY those vaccines given on the day listed in Item 10.
Item 14: List ANY OTHER vaccines the patient received within four weeks of the date listed in item 10.
Item 16: This section refers to how the person who gave the vaccine purchased it, not to the patient‘s insurance.
Item 17: List any prescription or non-prescription medications the patient was taking when the vaccine(s) was given.
item 18: List any short term illnesses the patient had on the date the vaccine(s) was given (i.e., cold, flu, ear infection).
item 19: List any pre-existing physician-diagnosed allergies, birth defects, medical conditions (including developmental and-or
neurologic disorders) the patient has.
Item 21 : List any suspected adverse events the patient, or the patient’s brothers or sisters, may have had to previous vaccinations.
if more than one brother or sister, or ifthe patient has reacted to more than one prior vaccine, use additional pagesto explain
completely. For the onset age of a patient, provide the age in months if less than two years old.

The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting
System (VAERS)

Immunizations against most vaccine-preventable diseases will be needed indeﬁnitely unless the
disease is eradicated. Public acceptance of immunizations may be threatened as vaccine coverage
increases and disease decreases, however, due to the increase in both causally- and coincidentally-
related vaccine adverse events. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) was created
to unify post-marketing surveillance for such events in the United States in response to the mandatory
reporting requirements of the National Childhood Injury Act of 1986. While VAERS has many
methodologic limitations intrinsic to such systems. it can play an important role in helping to monitor
vaccine safety and maintain public confidence in immunizations.
[corrected abstract]
Keywords: Vaatination; immunization; adverse reactions; product surveillance; postmarketing
Health care providers who administer vaccines and
vaccine manufacturers licensed in the United States are
required to report certain serious adverse .events
following speciﬁc vaccinations to the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).
This requirement became effective on 21 March 1988, to
comply with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act
(NCVIA) of 1986‘. This was the ﬁrst time in the US that
health care providers had been required to report
vaccine adverse events. The NCVIA stipulates the
vaccines, the adverse events, and the time of occurrence
after vaccination for which reporting is required
(Table I)‘.
The DI-lI-IS has determined that the Vaccine Adverse
Event Reporting System (VAERS) be established to
provide a single system for the collection and analysis
of reports on all adverse events associated with the
administration of any US licensed vaccine in all age
groups, including but not limited to the events listed in
Table I‘. The DI-II-IS has designated the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) to implement VAERS.
In this paper, we review the historical context that led
to this law, describe VAERS, and describe the uses and
the limitations of VAERS data in monitoring vaccine
safety.
POTENTIAL STAGES OF AN
IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMME

health measures available‘. Vaccine-preventable diseases
such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, Haemophilus
influenzae type b (Hib) disease, poliomyelitis, measles,
mumps and congenital rubella, which were once highly
prevalent, are now relatively uncommon or rare in the
US (Table 2), and, except for Hib disease, in most
developed countries as well’. With the assistance of many
donor agencies, the Expanded Programme on Immuniz-
ation of the World Health Organization has made major
strides since its inception in 1974 towards achieving
similar objectives in the developing world“.
Prior to licensure, vaccines must undergo rigorous
safety and immunogenicity testing in the laboratory, in
animals, and ultimately in phased trials in humans7.
Because no vaccine is perfectly safe or effective,
recommendations for the use of each vaccine always
require a careful weighing of the beneﬁts and the risks,
especially because vaccines are generally administered to
healthy persons. For any vaccine-preventable disease, the
beneﬁt-risk assessment is a dynamic process. The
relationship between the key variables in this beneﬁt-risk
analysis - the crude incidence of complications due to
the disease and the crude incidence of the adverse
reactions caused by the vaccine — changes depending on
the vaccine coverage (Figure I); the rates of complications
or reactions generally stay constant.
In the prevaccine era (stage I), morbidity and mortality
due to the disease were high. Diseases such as measles,
mumps, pertussis and rubella were essentially universal
infections in non-isolated populations‘. Other diseases
such as diphtheria, H. inﬂuenzae and polio may be less
infectious but cause substantial mortality and severe
sequelae. As immunization is introduced with progressive
increases in the vaccination levels of the population (stage
2), the impact of an effective vaccine is manifested by a
decrease in disease incidence; an initially negligible
number of true vaccine adverse reactions also increases
in proportion to the increase in vaccine use.
As the immunization programme matures and vaccine
coverage increases, disease incidence is substantially
reduced relative to the prevaccine era (stage 2).

Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System: R.T. Chen et at.
Consequently, most of the population immunity is
derived from vaccine rather than from disease. Because
of a reduced awareness of the health impact of
vaccine-preventable diseases, adverse events occurring in
close temporal association with vaccinations may receive
greater attention by the public. However, because the
proportion of the population vaccinated has increased,
the number of persons who experience an adverse event
and who coincidentally have a recent history of
vaccination is also increased. This increases the
probability that the event may be attributed to
vaccination even though scientiﬁc evidence of causality
other than temporal association may be lacking. Poorly
understood medical events such as encephalopathies’,
other neuropathiesm, sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS)11 and chronic fatigue syndrome12 may also be
attributed to vaccination. Given the difﬁculty of studying
such poorly deﬁned events and the inherent difﬁculty of
using scientiﬁc methods to disprove absolutely a possible
association", a cloud may be cast over the use of a
vaccine.
This increased focus on adverse events, often intensiﬁed
by media coverage of one or a few case reports, may lead
to a loss of conﬁdence in the vaccine by the public, a
reduction in vaccine coverage, and a resurgence of the
disease to higher or even epidemic levels (stage 3). This
phenomenon occurred with pertussis in Japan“, the
United Kingdom15 and Sweden16 in the 1970s, and, more
recently, with diphtheria in the former USSR". Among
the consequences of the increasing focus on diphtheria-
tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine adverse events in the US
is the increasing number of lawsuits brought against
the vaccine manufacturers (e.g. four in 1980 versus 255
in 1986), a dramatic increase in the price of vaccine ($0.15
per dose in 1980 to $7.69 in 1987), and a decrease in the
number of vaccine manufacturers (three in 1980 versus
two in 1992?“? Similar product liability concerns may
be delaying human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV)
vaccine trials”. The enactment of the NCVIA was an
attempt to reduce these threats to the stability of the
immunization programme and to compensate persons
who may have been injured by the vaccine“.
The resurgence of disease or the availability of an
alternative vaccine provides health authorities with an
opportunity to restore public conﬁdence in vaccination
against the disease, resulting in the resumption of high
vaccination levels and the reduction of disease to earlier
low levels (stage 4). For some vaccine-preventable
diseases (e.g. smallpox)“, the epidemiological character-
istics may permit the eradication of the causative
organism and hence the disease from mankind. Once
eradication is certiﬁed, vaccine use can be stopped,
thereby eliminating the adverse events associated with
its use (stage 5). For diseases that have a lower
transmission potential or effective therapies, routine
vaccinations may be stopped in some geographical areas
before eradication. This occurred with the use of smallpox
vaccine in the US“ and BCG vaccine in Sweden".
Although many vaccine-preventable diseases may be
controlled and even eliminated from some regions of the
worlds'zs'z‘, global eradication of these diseases from
mankind, with the possible exception of polio”, is
unlikely in the near future. Therefore, vaccinations
against diseases such as measles or pertussis must be
continued for the foreseeable future for each new birth
cohort. Similarly, the attendant risk for potential loss of
544 Vaccine 1994 Volume 12 Number 6
conﬁdence in vaccines because of reports of adverse
events or allegations of vaccine injury will also continue
indeﬁnitely. To ensure continued public acceptance
of vaccines, close monitoring of the incidence of adverse
events, adequate scientiﬁc evaluation of hypothesized
associations, and appropriate responses to newly
identiﬁed risks of vaccines are critical; VAERS will be
essential in monitoring and evaluating the safety of
current and future vaccines".
PHASES OF VACCINE SAFETY
EVALUATION
Vaccines, like other pharmaceutical products”, undergo
extensive testing and review for safety, immunogenicit
and efﬁcacy in phased trials before they are licensed .
Because these trials usually contain a placebo control or
comparison group, it is possible to ascertain which local
or systemic reactions were actually caused by the vaccine.
(Note: clinical events reported to surveillance systems like
VAERS that lack control groups are usually termed
‘adverse event’ rather than ‘adverse reaction’ because
attribution of causality to the vaccine is usually not
possible.) However, prelicensure trials are relatively small,
usually limited to a few thousand subjects, and usually
last no longer than a few years. In addition, they may be
conducted in populations more homogeneous than those
in which the vaccine is ultimately used. The sensitivity
for detection of uncommon or rare adverse reactions, or
those with delayed onset, before licensure is therefore
low. As a result, postlicensure or postmarketing
surveillance - the continuous monitoring of vaccine safety
in the general population after licensure — is needed to
identify and evaluate such adverse events.
Postmarketing surveillance and the monitoring of
vaccine safety can be accomplished in several ways. First,
vaccine lots can be tested for potency, general safety,
sterility, purity, identity and constituent materials before
their release for use7. Second, immediately after licensure,
vaccine use experience in a well defined population such
as a health maintenance organization (HMO), can be
monitored through protocol in a phase IV study. This has
recently been done with the Hib conjugate vaccinesw'n.
Although these studies contribute to the overall
knowledge about the safety and efficacy of a new
vaccine, they are also usually limited in duration and
sample size. The third postmarketing approach is to
collect spontaneous reports of adverse events, i.e. those
initiated by a concerned provider or consumer, as
opposed to active data collection under a study protocol.
Spontaneous reports, gathered either from the medical
literature or from reporting systems for adverse events
such as VAERS, provide a relatively affordable, ongoing
means2 of detecting new adverse events on a national
scale3 .
HISTORY OF VACCINE SAFETY
MONITORING IN THE UNITED STATES
Efforts to regulate and monitor the production of safe
vaccines and other biological products in the US began
around the turn of this century. Advances in the
understanding of microbiology led to the development
of a rabies vaccine and antitoxins against diphtheria and
tetanus, in addition to smallpox vaccine, which had been

available earlier. Although concerns were expressed
about the lack of regulations to protect against fraudulent
or impure antitoxins on the market, it was only after
13 children died from administration of tetanus-
contaminated diphtheria antitoxin that the ﬁrst Biologics
Control Act (or the Virus, Serum Toxin Law of 1902) was
adopted”. In 1912, the United States Public Health
Service (PI-IS) was created".
In 1935, six children died and six children were
paralysed after the administration of an early poliovirus
vaccine". Because of the associated controversy, most
researchers lowered their priority of developing a
poliovirus vaccine for many years“. In 1944, the PHS
act was amended to authorize the federal government to
license all biological products and their manufacturers.
Thisact also permitted the inspection of the manufacturing
facilities, and ensured that the products were accurately
labelled’. In 1955, polio developed in many vaccinees
after the receipt of inadequately inactivated poliovirus
vaccine from one manufacturer". Because of this
incident, the Division of Biologic Standards was created
at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The
epidemiological investigations by the CDC which quickly
identiﬁed the cause of the outbreak highlighted the
usefulness of such ﬁeld investigations as well as the need
for routine surveillance systems to detect such adverse
events". The rapid implementation of corrective
measures during vaccine production prevented potential
loss of public conﬁdence in this vaccine.
The thalidomide disaster helped the passage of the
Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act in 196239. This amendment strengthened
the requirements for evidence of safety and eﬁicacy before
licensure. The FDA also created a spontaneous reporting
system for adverse drug reactions, a system that became
computerized in 1969”. Reports of vaccine adverse
events, however, continued to be evaluated separately at
the Division of Biologic Standards, renamed the Bureau
of Biologics when it was transferred from the NIH to the
FDA in 1972. In 1976, during the National Inﬂuenza
Immunization Program, better known as the ‘swine ﬂu’
programme, CDC established a surveillance programme
for adverse events“. The detection by this system of an
increased number of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)
cases‘1 heavily inﬂuenced CDC’s decision to institute the
Monitoring System for Adverse Events Following
Immunization (MSAEFI) in 1978, along with its National
Childhood Immunization Initiative to improve vaccine
coverage“.
From 1978 to 1990, the CDC and the FDA
divided the responsibility for postmarketing surveillance
of vaccines in the United States. Reports of events
occurring following the administration of vaccines
purchased with public funds were reported to the CDC’s
MSAEFI; the FDA received reports of adverse events
after administration of vaccine purchased with private
funds. Most reports of the CDC were from public health
clinics operated by state and county health departments,
while reports to the FDA were mainly from private
physicians and vaccine manufacturers. Even though
collaboration was maintained between the two agencies,
the use of different reporting forms and reporting
requirements made combined analysis difﬁcult. The
passage of the NCVIA and its mandatory reporting
requirement was an opportunity to correct these
shortcomings.
STRUCTURE OF VAERS
To meet each agency's needs for vaccine safety
monitoring data, the CDC and the FDA have worked
together since 1988 to develop and implement VAERS.
These needs relate to CDC’s responsibilities for the
overall control of vaccine-preventable diseases and for
providing ﬁnancial and technical assistance to public-
sector vaccine programmes, and FDA's responsibilities
for licensing and regulating vaccines. A contractor has
been hired under CDC contract and operates under the
close supervision of the two agencies to distribute and
collect forms and to enter VAERS reports in a computer
database. On 1 November 1990, VAERS became fully
operational for reporting vaccine adverse events in the
US’. The events mandated for reporting are listed in
Table 1. In addition, persons are encouraged to report
all other clinically signiﬁcant adverse events following
the administration of any US-licensed vaccine in all age
groups, on the possibility that the adverse event may be
causally associated with the vaccination The impetus for
reporting may be based simply on factors such as the
occurrence of the event temporally following vaccination
and the lack of other obvious causes.
The VAERS form (Figure 2) is designed to permit
description of the adverse event in narrative form by the
reporter, as well as the type of vaccine(s) received, the
timing of vaccination and adverse event, demographic
information about the recipient, concurrent medical
illness or medications, and prior history of adverse events
following vaccination The form is preaddressed and
postage-paid; after completion it can be folded into thirds
and mailed directly to VAERS. Lay persons may also
report to VAERS. However, to improve the accuracy of
the data reported, they are encouraged to seek the
assistance of a health professional in completing the form.
Copies of the VAERS report form and Table I were
ﬁrst mailed in August 1990 and will be mailed annually
to physicians in the US who are likely to administer
vaccines. These include approximately 200 000 physicians
in the specialties of paediatrics, family practice, general
practice, internal medicine, obstetrics/gynaecology and
emergency medicine. Copies have also been sent through
the state health departments to public health clinics that
administer vaccines. Vaccine manufacturers, who by
regulations must report certain vaccine adverse events to
the FDA, now do so via VAERS. Additional report forms,
assistance in completing the form, or answers to other
questions about VAERS are available via a 24-hour
toll-free telephone number (l-800-822-7967). The NCVIA
also ‘requires that, before administering each vaccine, a
health care provider gives each parent a copy of the
vaccine information pamphlet developed by the DHHS,
outlining the beneﬁts and the risks of vaccination. The
vaccine information pamphlets, available since 15 April
1992 from sources such as the state health departments
and the American Academy of Pediatrics, contain
information on how to report the occurrence of an
adverse event to VAERS".
When reports of adverse events arrive at VAERS, they
are reviewed and assigned standard codes by using
Coding Symbols for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction
Terms (COSTART)“, (similar in principle to assignment
of International Classiﬁcation of Diseases/1CD codes)
from physician diagnoses and then are entered in a
computer database. A letter of veriﬁcation of receipt with

the assigned VAERS identiﬁcation number is sent to the
reporter. If a submitted serious report is missing key
information used for analysis (e.g. date of birth or patient
age, date of vaccination, adverse event description), the
acknowledgement letter also requests this information
from the reporter. Reporters of selected serious events are
contacted through the mail by VAERS at 60 days and at 1
year after vaccination for information regarding the
recovery status of the patient (Table 3). Reporters may
also submit additional relevant information to VAERS
by using the identiﬁcation number. This information is
also coded and appended to the original report.
ANALYSES AND USES OF VAERS DATA
The CDC and FDA have direct access to the VAERS
database for the analyses needed to meet the ongoing
needs of their respective agencies for vaccine safety data
The data are also updated monthly and are available to
the public through the National Technical Information
Service (703-487-4650).
Once entered in the VAERS database, the report is
further reviewed by teams composed of pharmacists,
physicians and statisticians. An assessment is made to
determine whether the reported event is reﬂected in the
product labelling Reports are also separated into serious
or non-serious categories. For an adverse event to be
categorized as serious by the FDA", it must have
resulted in one of the following: (1) death; (2) permanent
disability; (3) hospitalization; (4) prolongation of
hospitalization; or (5) have been determined to be
life-threatening. The events that are both serious and not
addressed in product labelling are given additional
scrutiny. Reports are further analysed to determine
whether concomitant medications or underlying disease
states could have contributed to the event. In the absence
of alternative explanations, extensive searches are
undertaken to discover any similar events reported either
through VAERS or through other sources such as
publications in the medical literature or third-party
databases. In addition, each report of death following the
administration of a vaccine is reviewed The reporter of
546 Vaccine 1994 Volume 12 Number 6
such an event may be contacted to provide additional
information such as laboratory data, hospital records or
the autopsy report.
Although within the acceptable limits for release,
vaccine potency may vary from lot to lot; this variability
may have an effect on the adverse event or the efﬁcacy
proﬁle of the vaccine. As reports of adverse events are
submitted to VAERS, the data are continually
monitored to detect clusters in both the type and severity
of events by vaccine type, manufacturer and lot number.
If signiﬁcant differences in the data are noted, the
manufacturer is asked to provide data on the number of
doses of vaccine of interest that have been distributed.
The VAERS data are then analysed further to compare
reporting rates.
The VAERS data provide information on the number
of adverse events reported nationwide, permit collection
and analyses of vaccine-speciﬁc and lot-speciﬁc inform-
ation, and potentially identify risk factors for adverse
events that may be contraindications to additional doses
(Table 4). The MSAEFI data, for example, indicated that
children who had a personal history of convulsions were
at an increased risk for convulsions following the
administration of DTP vaccine“. This inﬂuenced the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the
PI-IS to recommend delaying administration of DTP
vaccine in such children until their neurological status is
better deﬁned". Most important, however, VAERS‘
serves as a sentinel for the detection of either previously
unreported vaccine adverse events or unusual increases
in reported events. This sentinel role of VAERS is
especially important for newly licensed vaccines or new
indications of licensed vaccines.
Reports to VAERS may trigger further clinical,
epidemiological or laboratory investigations to assess
whether these signals are true causal associations or
reporting artifacts. Examples of followup studies on
signals prior to VAERS include investigations of (1)
possible associations between poliomyelitis and inacti-
vated” and oral" polio vaccine; (2) a cluster of infants
with SIDS following DTP vaccination‘°"°; (3) meningo-
encephalitis following mumps vaccination’l'”; (4) the
possible association of Guillain-Barré syndrome and
influenza vaccine“"‘. Such investigations may show that
the concern was either unsubstantiated”, method-
ologically impossible to assess due to the small sample

Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System: R.T. Chen et al.
LIMITATIONS OF VAERS DATA
Because of several intrinsic limitations of data gathered
through spontaneous reporting systems, follow-up
studies are necessary for suspected vaccine associations
initially identiﬁed by VAERS reports (Table 0732'“.
The amount and the quality of clinical information
recorded on the report form, for example, may be
insufficient for assessment. Increases in the number of
adverse events reported for a given vaccine may be simply
due to the increased distribution and use of the vaccine
rather than a true increase in the rate of adverse events.
The denominator data on the number of doses of vaccine
that have been administered, necessary to calculate the
rate of adverse events, is, however not readily
available to VAERS. An increase in reports may also be
an artifact of differences in reporting patterns or due to
changing publicity on adverse events.
Under-reporting may occur either because of lack of
detection, lack of attribution of the adverse event to the
exposure, or failure to complete and submit the
reportu'“. Under-reporting affects the ability to use
VAERS for detecting and analysing rare adverse events.
All public health disease surveillance systems, even those
for which reporting is mandated, suffer from under-
reporting‘3'“. As long as the reporting effort is
reasonably consistent, however, it is possible to detect
changes in trends of known common adverse events in
VAERS°3'“. Reports to the VAERS are not a random
sample of all adverse events and therefore may not be
representative. Reports submitted to VAERS may be
biased toward pre-existing or prevailing concepts of such
events"; therefore, caution is needed in extrapolating
conclusions from VAERS data to the general population.
Unlike other public health disease surveillance systems
for which a distinct case deﬁnition exists, many adverse
events reported to VAERS (e.g. encephalopathy, GBS,
SIDS) are clinical syndromes that may be poorly deﬁned
or poorly understood or are diagnoses of exclusion. The
information recorded on VAERS forms may not be
classiﬁed easily. Multiple vaccines may have been
administered during the same visit, so attribution to a
single vaccine may be difficult
The greatest limitation of VAERS, however, is its
general inability to determine whether a vaccine actually
caused the reported adverse event. Vaccines can be said
to cause the event if (I) the vaccine organism is isolated
from where it should not be (cg mumps vaccine aseptic
meningitis"), (2) a clinical syndrome highly speciﬁc to
the vaccine adverse event exists (e.g. the acute ﬂaccid
paralysis of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis in a setting
where no wild poliovirus is circulating), and-or (3)
epidemiological evidence exists that vaccinated persons
are at higher risk for an adverse event than a comparison
group, and other supportive evidence is also consistent,
for example, a plausible biological mechanism and a
reasonable interval between vaccination and onset (e.g.
1976 swine inﬂuenza vaccine and GBS“).
However, most reports to VAERS do not contain
laboratory or clinical ﬁndings specific to vaccine. Most
events on these reports can also be caused by other
aetiologies (e.g. concomitant drugs, underlying disease).
Unfortunately, VAERS reports contain less than
one-quarter of the information necessary to make an
epidemiological assessment of causality. Adverse events
not temporally associated with vaccination and other
548 Vaccine 1994 Volume 12 Number 6
information needed to complete a two-by-two table of
exposure and outcome necessary for an epidemiological
assessment are not reported to VAERS“.
Reports to VAERS are essentially non-controlled
clinical case reports or case series, useful for generating
hypotheses but not for testing them. Therefore, other
controlled studies are frequently necessary to evaluate
the hypothesis raised by a VAERS report — whether a
given adverse event can be caused by a speciﬁc vaccine,
and, if so, how frequently.
MECHANISMS FOR HYPOTHESIS TESTING
Once a vaccine has been licensed, it is not possible to
study vaccine adverse events in a large-scale, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial - the ideal
scientiﬁc approach to examine an association between
vaccination and adverse events. Witholding an effective
preventive measure is generally considered unethical, and
the cost is prohobitive for studying rare adverse reactions.
Alternatively, observational epidemiological studies“,
using either the case-control""° or cohort“"‘ designs,
have been used. Such studies, performed on an ad hoc
basis, are logistically diﬁicult and extremely expensive,
however, and do not allow routine testing of more than
a few hypotheses.
One promising alternative approach for pharmaco-
epidemiological studies that has emerged in recent years
is the use of large, linked databases (LLDBPZ. The
databases appropriate for such studies are derived from
deﬁned populations such as members of health
maintenance organizations, universal health care systems,
and Medicaid programmes. Information on both the
exposure (e.g. vaccination records) and the outcome (cg.
inpatient and outpatient diagnoses recording potential
adverse events) is usually computerized for members of
such populations. These databases can be linked for
epidemiological studies assessing potential associations
between the exposure and the outcome. Because the
databases are usually generated during routine adminis-
tration of such programmes, the problems of under-
reporting or recall bias are minimized. Because these
programmes have enrollees numbering from thousands
to millions, large cohorts may be assembled to examine
less frequent adverse events. Denominator data and
con rol groups are also theoretically available. With the
exception of adverse events with insidious or delayed
onset, traditional epidemiological methods may be used
to evaluate the risk of vaccination and speciﬁc outcomes
once the LLDB is assembled. Hence LLDBs can
potentially provide an economical and rapid means of
detecting as well as evaluating new hypothesized vaccine
adverse events.
LLDBs have already been used by two groups to
examine the association between DTP and SIDS°"'“,
DTP and neurological events69'7°, and measles-mumps-
rubella vaccine and seizures". The CDC has established
LLDBs in four HMOs for use in vaccine safety studies
of 500000 children younger than 7 years of age”.
Common protocols will ensure the consistency of
prospectively gathered data from all sites. Data can be
pooled to increase the power for detecting rare adverse
events. After 5 years of data collection, associations may
be detected for events that occur as rarely as once per
300000 doses of vaccine. Because of concomitant
collection of demographic and medical covariates,

potential confounders can be adjusted for at the time of
analysis. There is potential to expand the LLDBs to larger
populations to have greater power to detect rare adverse
events for current vaccines, to include age groups older
than 7 years of age to evaluate adverse events in older
children and adults, and to collect data indeﬁnitely to
detect ever more rare potential adverse events and to
assess the safety of newly licensed vaccines in a timely
manner.
SUMMARY
Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective public health
interventions available. Their efﬁcacy in reducing disease
incidence has led to an increased focus on adverse events.
Close monitoring of vaccine safety is necessary to
maintain the public conﬁdence in vaccination pro-
grammes. Such monitoring also provides information
critical for vaccine research, development and policy. The
reporting requirements of the National Childhood
Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 have created an opportunity
to facilitate and standardize vaccine adverse event
reporting nationally. Although VAERS cannot solve
many of the problems inherent in spontaneous reporting
systems, it serves as a useful complement to other
methods of postmarketing surveillance for vaccines in the
United States. Health care providers can play an
important role in this process by reporting all clinically
signiﬁcant vaccine adverse events to VAERS.

INTRODUCTION
As a practitioner giving vaccinations, you will encounter patients who have
reservations about getting vaccinations or getting them for their children,
including some who might decline to be vaccinated at all. There can be many
reasons for patients’ fear of or opposition to vaccination. Some patients have
religious or philosophic objections. Some see mandatory vaccination as
interference by the government into what they believe should be a personal choice.
Others are concerned about the safety and-or efﬁcacy of vaccines, or may believe
that vaccine-preventable diseases do not pose a serious health risk.
A practitioner has a responsibility to listen to and try to understand a patient’s
concerns, fears, and beliefs about vaccination and to take these into consideration
when offering vaccines. This will not only help to strengthen the bond of trust
between patient and provider but will also help you decide what, if any,
arguments might be most effective in persuading these patients to accept
vaccination.
The purpose of this pamphlet is to address ﬁve common misconceptions about
vaccination. These are often cited by concerned parents as reasons to question the
wisdom of vaccinating their children, and if we can respond with accurate
rebuttals perhaps we can not only ease their minds on these specific issues but
discourage them from accepting other anti-vaccine "facts" at face value. Our goal
is not to browbeat parents into vaccinating, but to make sure they have accurate
information with which to make an informed decision.

l. Diseases hCld already begun to disappear before vaccines were introduced,
because of better hygiene and sanitation.
Statements like this are very common in anti-vaccine literature, the intent
apparently being to suggest that vaccines are not needed. Improved socioeconomic
conditions have undoubtedly had an indirect impact on disease. Better nutrition,
not to mention the development of antibiotics and other treatments, have
increased survival rates among the sick; less crowded living conditions have
reduced disease transmission; and lower birth rates have decreased the number of
susceptible household contacts. But looking at the actual incidence of disease over
the years can leave little doubt of the signiﬁcant direct impact vaccines have had,
even in modern times. Here, for example, is a graph showing the reported
incidence of measles from 1920 to the present.

There were periodic peaks and valleys throughout the years, but the real,
permanent drop coincided with the licensure and wide use of measles vaccine
beginning in 1963. Graphs for other vaccine-preventable diseases show a roughly
similar pattern, with all except hepatitis B‘ showing a signiﬁcant drop in cases

*The incidence rate of hepatitis B has not dropped as dramatically yet because
the infants we began vaccinating in 1991 will not be at high risk of the disease
until they are at least teenagers. Therefore we expect about a 15-year lag
between the start of universal infant vaccination and a signiﬁcant drop in disease
incidence.

corresponding with the advent of vaccine use. Are we expected to believe that
better sanitation caused incidence of each disease to drop, coincidentally, just at
the time a vaccine for that disease was introduced?
Hib vaccine is another good example, because Hib disease was prevalent up until
just a few years ago, when conjugate vaccines that can be used in infants were
ﬁnally developed. (The polysaccharide vaccine previously available could not be
used for infants, in whom most of the disease was occurring.) Since sanitation is
not better now than it was in 1990, it is hard to attribute the virtual
disappearance of Hib disease in children in recent years (from an estimated 20,000
cases a year to 1,419 cases in 1993, and dropping) to anything other than the
vaccine.
Varicella can also be used to illustrate the point, since modern sanitation has
obviously not prevented nearly 4 million cases from occurring each year in the
United States. If diseases were disappearing, we should expect varicella to be
disappearing along with the rest of them. But nearly all children in the United
States get the disease today, just as they did 20 years ago or 80 years ago. Based
on experience with the varicella vaccine in studies prior to licensure, we can
expect the incidence of varicella to drop signiﬁcantly now that a vaccine has been
licensed for the United States.
Finally, we can look at the experiences of several developed countries that let their
immunization levels drop. Three countries — Great Britain, Sweden, and Japan
— cut back on the use of pertussis vaccine because of fear about the vaccine. The
effect was dramatic and immediate. In Great Britain, a drop in pertussis
vaccination in 1974 was followed by an epidemic of more than 100,000 cases of
pertussis and 36 deaths by 1978. In Japan, around the same time, a drop in
vaccination rates from 70% to 20%-40% led to a jump in pertussis from 393 cases
and no deaths in 1974 to 13,000 cases and 41 deaths in 1979. In Sweden, the
annual incidence rate of pertussis per 100,000 children 0-6 years of age increased
from 700 cases in 1981 to 3,200 in 1985. It seems clear from these experiences
that not only would diseases not be disappearing without vaccines, but if we were
to stop vaccinating, they would come back.
Of more immediate interest is the major epidemic of diphtheria now taking place
in the former Soviet Union, where low primary immunization rates in children
and lack of booster immunizations in adults have resulted in an increase from 839
cases in 1989 to nearly 50,000 cases and 1,700 deaths in 1994, with the number of
cases increasing by 2-lto 10-fold each year. There have already been at least 20
imported cases in Europe and two cases in U.S. citizens working in the former
Soviet Union.

2. The majority of people getting disease have been fully immunized.
This is another argument frequently found in anti-vaccine literature — the
implication being that this proves vaccines are not effective. In fact it is true that
in an outbreak the cases who were vaccinated often outnumber those who were
not — even with vaccines such as measles, which we know to be about 98%
effective when used as recommended.
This apparent paradox is explained by two factors. First, no vaccine is 100%
effective. To make vaccines safer than the disease, the bacteria or virus is killed
or weakened (attenuated). For reasons related to the individual, not all persons
vaccinated will develop immunity. Most routine childhood vaccines have efficacy
in the 85-95% range. Second, in a country like the United States the people who
have been vaccinated vastly outnumber those who have not. How these two
factors work together to result in outbreaks where the majority of cases have been
vaccinated can be more easily understood by looking at a hypothetical example:
In a high school of 1,000 students, none has ever had measles. All
but 5 of the students have had two doses of measles vaccine, and so
are fully immunized. The entire student body is exposed to measles
and every susceptible student becomes infected. The 5 unvaccinated
students will be infected, of course. But of the 995 who have been
vaccinated, we would expect several vaccine failures. The efficacy
rate for two doses of measles vaccine can be as high as >99%, and in
this class there are 7 vaccine failures, who become infected too.
Therefore 7/12, or about 58%, of the cases are fully vaccinated.
As you can see, this doesn’t prove the vaccine didn’t work —- only that most of the
children in the class had been vaccinated, so the vaccine failures outnumbered the
unvaccinated susceptibles. Looking at it another way, 100% of the children who
were not vaccinated got measles, compared with less than 1% of those who were.

3. There are "hot lots" of vaccine that have been associated with more adverse
events and deaths than others. Parents should find the numbers of these lots
and not allow their children to receive vaccines from them.
This misconception got considerable publicity recently when vaccine safety was the
subject of a television news program. First of all, the concept of a "hot lot" of
vaccine as it is used in this context is wrong. It is based on the presumption that
the more VAERS“ reports a vaccine lot is associated with, the more dangerous
the vaccine in that lot; and that by consulting a list showing the number of
VAERS reports per lot, a parent can identify vaccine lots to avoid.
This is misleading for two reasons:
1. VAERS is a system for reporting events that are temporally
associated with receipt of vaccine; VAERS reports should not be
interpreted to imply causality. In other words, a VAERS report does
not mean that the vaccine caused the event. Statistically, a certain
number of serious illnesses, even deaths, can be expected to occur by
chance alone among children recently vaccinated. While vaccines are
known to cause minor, temporary side effects like soreness or fever,
there is little, if any, evidence linking vaccination with permanent
health problems or death. The point is that just because an adverse
event has been reported to VAERS, it does not mean it was caused by
a vaccine.
2. Vaccine lots are not the same. The sizes of vaccine lots might vary
from several hundred thousand doses to several million, and some are
in distribution much longer than others. Naturally a larger lot or one
that is in distribution longer will be associated with more adverse
events, simply by chance. Also, more coincidental deaths are
associated with vaccines given in infancy than later in childhood,
since the background death rates in children are highest during the
ﬁrst year of life. So knowing that lot A has been associated with x
number of adverse events while lot B has been associated with y
number would not necessarily tell you anything about the relative
safety of the two lots, even if the vaccine did cause the events.
Reviewing published lists of "hot lots" will not help parents identify the best or
worst vaccines for their children. If the number and type of VAERS reports for a
particular vaccine lot suggested that it was associated with more serious adverse
events or deaths than are expected by chance, FDA has the legal authority to
immediately recall that lot. To date, no vaccine lot in the modern era has been

“The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) receives reports,
from either providers or patients, of adverse events that occur after the
administration of any vaccine.

found to be unsafe on the basis of VAERS reports.
Every vaccine manufacturing facility and vaccine product is licensed by the FDA.
In addition, every vaccine lot is safety-tested by the manufacturer. The results of
these tests are reviewed by FDA, who may repeat some of these tests as an
additional protective measure. FDA also inspects vaccine-manufacturing facilities
regularly to ensure adherence to manufacturing procedures and product-testing
regulations, and reviews the weekly VAERS reports for each lot searching for
unusual patterns. FDA would recall a lot of vaccine at the ﬁrst sign of problems.
There is no beneﬁt to either the FDA or the manufacturer in allowing unsafe
vaccine to remain on the market. And since vaccines are given to otherwise
healthy children, the American public would not tolerate them if they did not have
to conform to the most rigorous safety standards. The mere fact is that a vaccine
lot still in distribution says that it is considered safe by the FDA.

4. Vaccines cause many harmful side effects, illnesses, and even death — not
to mention possible long-term effects we don't even know about.
Vaccines are actually very safe, despite implications to the contrary in much anti-
vaccine literature (which sometimes quotes the number of reports received by
VAERS, and allows the reader to infer that they all represent genuine vaccine
side-effects). The vast majority of vaccine adverse events are minor and
temporary, like a sore arm or mild fever. These can often be controlled by taking
acetaminophen before or after vaccination. More serious adverse events occur
rarely (on the order of one per thousands to one per millions of doses), and some
are so rare that risk cannot be accurately assessed. As to vaccines causing death,
again there are so few deaths that could plausibly be attributed to vaccines that it
is hard to assess the risk statistically. Of all deaths reported to VAERS between
1990 and 1992, only one is believed to be even possibly associated with a vaccine.
Each death reported to VAERS is thoroughly examined to ensure that it is not
related to a new vaccine-related problem, but little or no evidence exists to suggest
that vaccines have contributed to any of the reported deaths. The Institute of
Medicine in its 1994 report states that the risk of death from vaccines is
"extraordinarily low."

DTP Vaccine and SIDS
One myth that won’t seem to go away is that DTP vaccine causes
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). This belief came about because
a moderate proportion of SIDS deaths occur in children who have
recently been vaccinated with DTP; and on the surface, this seems to
point toward a causal connection. But this logic is faulty; you might as
well say that eating bread causes car crashes, since most drivers who
crash their cars could probably be shown to have eaten bread within the
past 24 hours.
If you consider that most SIDS deaths occur during the same range of
ages when 3 shots of DTP are given, you would expect DTP shots to
precede a fair number of SIDS deaths simply by chance. In fact, when a
number of well-controlled studies were conducted during the 1980’s,
they found, nearly unanimously, that the number of SIDS deaths
temporally associated with DTP vaccination was within the range
expected to occur by chance. In other words, the SIDS deaths would
have occurred even if no vaccinations had been given. In fact, in several
of the studies children who had recently gotten a DTP shot were less
likely to get SIDS. The Institute of Medicine reports that "all controlled
studies that have compared immunized versus nonimmunized children
have found either no association . . . or a decreased risk . . . of SIDS
among immunized children," and concludes that "the evidence does not
indicate a causal relation between [DTP] vaccine and SIDS."

But looking at risk alone is not enough — you must always look at both risks and
beneﬁts. Even one serious adverse effect in a million doses of vaccine cannot be
justiﬁed if there is no beneﬁt from the vaccination. If there were no vaccines,
there would be many more cases of disease, and along with them, more serious
side effects, including death. For example, an analysis of the beneﬁt and risk of
DTP immunization has concluded that without an immunization program there
could be a 71-fold increase in cases of pertussis and a nearly 4-fold increase in
deaths due to pertussis in the United States. A comparison of the risk from
disease with the risk from the vaccines that protect against them can give us an
idea of the beneﬁts we get from vaccinating our children.

Risk from Disease vs. Risk from Vaccines

DISEASE VACCINES
Measles MMR
Pneumonia = 1 in 20 Encephalitis or severe allergic reaction = 1 in
Encephalitis = 1 in 2,000 1,000,000
Death = 1 in 3,000
Mumps
Encephalitis = 1 in 300
Rubella
Congenital Rubella Syndrome = 1 in 4
(if woman becomes infected
early in pregnancy)
Diphtheria DTP
Death = 1 in 20 Continuous crying, then full recovery = 1 in 100
convulsions or shock, then full recovery = 1 in
Tetanus 1,750
Death = 3 in 100 Acute encephalopathy = 010.5 in 1,000,000
Death = None proven
Pertussis
Pneumonia = 1 in 8
Encephalitis = 1 in 20
Death = 1 in 200



The fact is that a child is far more likely to be seriously injured by one of these
diseases than by any vaccine. While any serious injury or death caused by
vaccines is too many, it is also clear that the beneﬁts of vaccination greatly
outweigh the slight risk, and that many, many more injuries and deaths would
occur Without them. In fact, to have a medical intervention as effective in
preventing disease as vaccination and not use it would be unconscionable.
Research is underway by the U.S. Public Health Service to better understand
which vaccine adverse events are truly caused by vaccines and how to reduce the
already low risk of serious vaccine-related injury even further.

5. Vaccine-preventable diseases have been virtually eliminated from the
United States, so there is no need for my child to be vaccinated.
It’s true that vaccination has enabled us to reduce most vaccine-preventable
diseases to very low levels in the United States. However, some of them are still
quite prevalent — even epidemic — in other parts of the World. Travellers can
unknowingly bring these diseases into the U.S., and if We were not protected by
vaccinations these diseases could quickly spread throughout the population,
causing epidemics here. At the same time, the relatively few cases we currently
have in the U.S. could very quickly become tens or hundreds of thousands of cases
Without the protection we get from vaccines.
We should still be vaccinated, then, for two reasons. The ﬁrst is to protect
ourselves. Even if we think our chances of getting any of these diseases is small,
the diseases still exist and can still infect anyone who is not protected. A few
years ago in California a child who had just entered school caught diphtheria and
died. He was the only unvaccinated pupil in his class.
The second reason to get vaccinated is to protect those around us. There is a
small number of people who cannot be vaccinated (because of severe allergies to
vaccine components, for example), and a small percentage of vaccine failures.
These people are susceptible to disease, and their only hope of protection is that
people around them are immune and cannot pass disease along to them. A
successful vaccination program, like a successful society, depends on the
cooperation of every individual to ensure the good of all. We would think it
irresponsible of a driver to ignore all traffic regulations on the presumption that
other drivers will watch out for him. In the same way We shouldn’t rely on people
around us to stop the spread of disease without doing what we can as well.


## p. 1230 (#436) ###########################################

6. Giving a child multiple vaccinations for different diseases at the same time
increases the risk of harmful side effects and can overload the immune system.
Children are exposed to many foreign antigens every day. Routine consumption of
food introduces new bacteria into the body, and numerous bacteria live in the
mouth and nose, exposing the immune system to still more antigens. An upper
respiratory viral infection exposes a child to between 4 and 10 antigens, and a
case of "strep throat" to between 25 and 50. According to the Institute of
Medicine’s 1994 report, Adverse Events Associated with Childhood Vaccines, "In
the face of these normal events, it seems unlikely that the number of separate
antigens contained in childhood vaccines . . . would represent an appreciable
added burden on the immune system that would be immunosuppressive." And,
indeed, available scientiﬁc data show no adverse effects of simultaneous
vaccination with multiple vaccines on the normal childhood immune system.
A number of studies have been conducted to examine the effects of giving various
combinations of vaccines simultaneously. In fact, neither the Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) nor the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
would recommend simultaneous administration of any vaccines until such studies
showed the combinations to be both safe and effective. These studies have shown
that ‘the recommended vaccines are as effective in combination as they are
individually, and that such combinations cause no greater risk for adverse side
effects. Consequently, both the ACIP and AAP recommend simultaneous
administration of all routine childhood vaccines when appropriate. Research is
currently underway to ﬁnd ways to combine more antigens in a single vaccine
injection (for example, MMR and chickenpox). This will assure all the advantages
of the individual vaccines, but require fewer shots.
There are two practical factors in favor of giving a child several vaccinations
during the same visit. First, we want to immunize children as early as possible to
give them protection during the vulnerable early months of their lives. This
generally means giving inactivated vaccines beginning at 2 months and live
vaccines at 12 months. Therefore, doses the various vaccines tend to fall due at
the same time. Second, if we can give several vaccinations at the same time it
will mean fewer ofﬁce visits for vaccinations, which saves parents both time and
money and may be less traumatic for the child.

MEASLES VIRUS ISOLATION

I. Background
The availability of a sensitive cell line (895a) for isolation of measles virus from clinical
specimens and the establishment of automated DNA sequencing techniques have
allowed for rapid genetic characterization of a large number of wild-type strains of
measles virus. This database of sequence information now makes it possible to use
molecular epidemiological techniques to identify the source of wild-type viruses and to
rapidly differentiate between wild-type and vaccine strains. As progress is made toward
elimination of measles in the U.S., it will be critical to examine virus isolates from as
many outbreaks as possible in order to identify the source of the virus.
Virus isolation and genetic characterization can take several months to complete.
Therefore, diagnosis of measles should always be based on detection of measles-
speciﬁc lgM in serum. The lgM-capture ElA test can be completed in one day, and is
available from virtually all state health department laboratories. Specimens for virus
isolation can and should be taken at the same time that serum is obtained, since a
delay in collection will reduce the chance of isolating the virus. However, urine or nasal
specimens should not be substituted for serum specimens for measles diagnosis.
The Measles Virus Section is currently testing the possibility of using saliva in addition to
serum to diagnose measles using the lgM-capture ElA. During a measles outbreak, if
you believe that you can collect saliva in addition to serum to help test this method,
please contact the Measles Virus Section, who will provide you with saliva collection
kits. An aliquot of serum should be send with the saliva.
ll. Protocols
Specimens should be obtained as soon as possible after the onset of rash. Always
collect a urine specimen and, if possible, attempt to collect a respiratory specimen.
Protocols are described below.
A. Respiratory Specimens:
Materials:
1. sterile swabs
2. sterile saline
3. 3 ml aliquots of viral transport medium (VT M: sterile PBS or suitable isotonic
solution such as Hank's 888, etc. containing antibiotics (100 units-ml penicillin, 100
ug-ml streptomycin) and either 2 % fetal bovine serum or 0.5% gelatin in 15 ml
polycarbonate or polystyrene centrifuge tubes
5 ml plastic syringes
plastic aspirators or 30 ml syringe
styrofoam shipping containers
93.01:“


## p. 1248 (#454) ###########################################

In i
1. Attempt to obtain the sample as soon as possible after onset of rash but a maximum
of 4 days after rash onset.
2. The preferred specimen is a nasal wash (nasopharyngeal aspirate) using a syringe
attached to a small, plastic tube and 3-5 ml of VTM. After placing VTM in the nose,
aspirate as much of the material as possible and rinse the tube with a small volume
(2 ml) of VTM.
3. Alternatively, sterile swabs can be used to wipe the nose and throat. Place both
swabs in a tube containing 2-3 ml of transport medium. The virus is extremely cell-
associated, so attempt to swab the throat and nasal passages to collect epithelial
cells.
4. Keep all specimens on wet ice or at 4° C and ship as soon as possible on wet ice
(see address below).
If immediate, cold shipment (within 48 hr.) cannot be arranged or is not convenient,
nasal wash specimens can be centrifuged at 2500 x g for 15 minutes at 4° C and the
pellet resuspended in 1 ml of tissue culture medium. If possible, the supernatant can be
saved in a separate tube. The samples should be frozen and shipped at -70° C (dry ice).
lf centrifugation is not available the whole specimen can be frozen (preferably at -70° C)
and shipped on dry ice.
Nose and throat swabs can be removed from the transport medium after allowing some
time for elution of virus. The specimen can then be frozen at -70 C and shipped on dry
ice.
B. Urine specimens
The Measles Virus Section prefers urine to be collected in the ﬁrst week after rash
onset, though they will accept urines up to 16 days after rash onset. Virus has been
isolated from the urine for up to one week after the onset of rash. They will also accept
urine from close contacts of measles cases (e.g., household contacts) if they are
collected 14 days after the rash onset of the measles case. First morning voided
specimens are ideal, but any urine collection is adequate. Collect up to 50-100 ml of
urine in a 50 ml centrifuge tube or a urine specimen container. Centrifuge at 2500 x g for
15 minutes at 4° C to pellet the sediment. Resuspend the sediment in 2-3 ml of VTM
(above) or any cell culture medium (DMEM, EMEM, RPMI plus antibiotics) and ship.
Preferably specimens that have been centrifuged and resuspended should be frozen at
-70° C and shipped on dry ice. If dry ice is not available, however, they can be stored at
4° C and shipped on wet ice.
It centrifugation is not available, do not freeze the urine sample. The entire urine
specimen should be stored at 4°C, and shipped to the lab on wet ice.


## p. 1249 (#455) ###########################################

C. Virus Isolation:
The marmoset lymphocyte cell line B95a is Epstein-Barr virus transformed and should
be handled as an infectious cell line capable of yielding Epstein-Barr virus (Kobune et
al., 1990, J Virol. 64:700-705). This cell line is useful in measles virus isolation with
syncytial and giant-cell cytopathogenic effect (CPE) sometimes visible as early as 48
hours after inoculation. Isolation-attempt cultures should be followed for 7-8 days with
subsequent passages 2-3 times before ruling out possible isolation of measles virus.
895-8 cells are available from the American Type Culture Collection (# CRL 1612).
When cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM), these cells
will adhere to the surface of the culture vessel and the adherent cells are referred to as
895a.
The cells grow gently attached to the culture surface when grown in DMEM
supplemented with 100 units-ml penicillin, 100 mg-ml streptomycin, 0.25 ug-ml
amphotericin (fungizone), and fetal bovine serum. Cell growth is sustained by adding 5-
10% fetal bovine serum (F88). P88 is used at a 2% concentration for cell maintenance
during viral isolation.
The 895a cells can be passaged by brieﬂy treating the cell monolayers with 0.05%
trypsin-EDTA to release cells from tissue culture surface. Be careful not to over
trypsinize. Neutralize trypsin by adding DMEM containing FBS. Usually the cells from a
single monolayer culture can be split 1:3. One will notice that more cells tend to become
"ﬂoaters", growing in clumps suspended in the medium as the cell density increases.
These cells are viable and can be passaged by gently pipetting to break up the clumps
then replating to a lower cell density.
Cells can be transported in a T-75 or T-25 tissue culture ﬂask with additional medium
added to help keep cells attached. Upon arrival look at the cell sheet. If many cells are
free-ﬂoating, a light spin of the medium will recover cells which can be added back to the
ﬂask (or to another ﬂask for passage). Add 30-35 mls of the medium back to the ﬂask
for maintenance. Grow cells in a moist C02 incubator at 37° C. Cell stocks can be
frozen using standard cryoprotection medium (20% FBS, 10% DMSO).
Inoculation.
1. Passage cells, split into T-25 ﬂasks @ 1:3 or 1:4 and incubate 24-48 hours.
2. Decant medium, add 1-1.5 ml DMEM w/2X antibiotics, add 0.1 to 1.0 ml of clinical
specimen depending on concentration.
3. Incubate at 37 C. for 1 hour.
4. Decant medium into bleach water, replace medium with DMEM containing 2% FBS
and 2X antibiotics.
5. Change medium every 3-4 days and passage cells by splitting @ 1:3 every 7-9
days. Check for CPE daily.



## p. 1250 (#456) ###########################################

6. Attempt at least three passages before discontinuing isolation protocol. Do not
discard remaining clinical specimens as they may still be used for PCR analysis.
7. If CPE is visible, continue to feed the cells until the CPE becomes extensive. It may
be necessary to passage the cells one time to allow the CPE to progress. When
CPE is maximal, pellet cells and freeze at -70 C.
If successful virus isolation has been performed conﬁrmation can be achieved by using
an immunological assay such as ﬂuorescent antibody or by PCR. Please remember to
save some of the original clinical specimen. This material can be used for a
second isolation attempt if problems occur with the ﬁrst as well as provide a
specimen for PCR analysis.
For shipping, it is best to send a plastic 25 cm2 tissue culture vessel. Cells should be
seeded and infected just prior to shipping. Once cells have been infected, ﬁll the vessel
to the top with tissue culture medium (plus antibiotics and 2% FBS). Screw the top on
tightly and seal with Paraﬁlm. It is best to place the vessel in a leak-proof container such
as a ziplock plastic bag and ship to at room temperature.
Alternatively, infected cells can be pelleted, resuspended in a small volume of medium
and frozen at -70° C before shipping on dry ice.
D. Shipping:
Viral isolates (not clinical specimens) arriving from overseas will require CDC and USDA
Import Permits. Please call numbers below to obtain a permit.
If Federal Express is available, contact the CDC to arrange pre-paid transport. it not,
CDC will be able to re-imburse for shipping costs.
