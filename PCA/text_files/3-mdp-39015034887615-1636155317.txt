Recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
General Recommendations on Immunization
This revision of the "General Recommendations on Immunization” updates the 1983 statement ( 1).
Changes or new sections include 1) listing of vaccines available in the United States by type and
recommended routes, 2) updated schedules for immunizing infants and children, 3) clarification of the
guidelines for spacing administration of immune globulin preparations and different vaccines, 4) an
updated table of recommendations for routine immunization of children infected with human
immunodeficiency virus, 5) listing of conditions that are often inappropriately considered contraindi-
cations to immunization, and 6) addition of information on the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act
of 1986 and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. These recommendations are not
comprehensive for each vaccine; Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommenda-
tions on each vaccine should be consulted for more details.
INTRODUCTION
Recommendations for immunizing infants, children, and adults are based on characteristics of
immunobiologics, scientific knowledge about the principles of active and passive immunization, and
judgments by public health officials and specialists in clinical and preventive medicine. Benefits and
risks are associated with the use of all immunobiologics: no vaccine is completely safe or completely
effective. Benefits of immunization range from partial to complete protection against the conse-
quences of disease (which range from mild or asymptomatic infection to severe consequences, such
as paralysis or death); risks of immunization range from common, trivial, and inconvenient side effects
to rare, severe, and life-threatening conditions. Thus, recommendations for immunization practices
balance scientific evidence of benefits, costs, and risks to achieve optimal levels of protection against
infectious diseases. These recommendations describe this balance and attempt to minimize the risks
by providing specific advice regarding dose, route, and spacing of immunobiologics and delineating
situations that warrant precautions or contraindicate their use. They are recommendations for use in
the United States because epidemiologic circumstances and vaccines often differ in other countries.
Individual circumstances may warrant deviations from these recommendations. The relative balance
of benefits and risks can change as diseases are controlled or eradicated. For example, because
smallpox has been eradicated throughout the world, the risk of complications associated with
smallpox vaccine now exceeds the risk of the disease; consequently, smallpox vaccination of civilians
is now indicated only for laboratory workers directly involved with smallpox or closely related
orthopox viruses (e.g., monkeypox and vaccinia).
DEFINITIONS
Immunobiologic
Immunobiologics include both antigenic substances, such as vaccines and toxoids, and antibody-
containing preparations, including globulins and antitoxins, from human or animal donors. These
products are used for active or passive immunization or therapy. Examples include:
Vaccine (Table 1): A suspension of live (usually attenuated) or inactivated microorganisms (bacteria,
viruses, or rickettsiae) or fractions thereof administered to induce immunity and thereby prevent
infectious disease. Some vaccines contain highly defined antigens (e.g., the polysaccharide of
Haemophilus influenzae type b or the surface antigen of hepatitis B); others have antigens that are
complex or incompletely defined (e.g., killed Bordetella pertussis or live attenuated viruses).
Toxoid: A modified bacterial toxin that has been rendered nontoxic but retains the ability to
stimulate the formation of antitoxin.
Immune globulin (IG): A sterile solution containing antibodies from human blood. It is obtained by
cold ethanol fractionation of large pools of blood plasma and contains 15%–18% protein. Intended for

intramuscular administration, it is primarily indicated for routine maintenance of immunity of
certain immunodeficient persons and for passive immunization against measles and hepatitis A. IG
does not transmit hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or other infectious diseases.
Intravenous immune globulin (IGIV): A product derived from blood plasma from a donor pool
similar to the IG pool but prepared so it will be suitable for intravenous use. IGIV does not transmit
infectious diseases. It is primarily indicated for replacement therapy in antibody-deficiency disorders.
Specific IG: Special preparations obtained from blood plasma from donor pools preselected for a
high antibody content against a specific antigen, e.g., hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), varicella-
zoster immune globulin, rabies immune globulin, and tetanus immune globulin. Like IG and IGIV, these
preparations do not transmit infectious diseases.
Antitoxin: A solution of antibodies derived from the serum of animals immunized with specific
antigens (e.g., diphtheria antitoxin, botulinum antitoxin) used to achieve passive immunity or for
treatment.
Vaccination and Immunization
These terms are often used interchangeably. Vaccination and vaccine derive from vaccinia, the
virus once used as smallpox vaccine. Thus, vaccination originally meant inoculation with vaccinia
virus to render a person immune to smallpox. Although some persons still prefer that vaccination be
restricted to this use, most use it to denote the administration of any vaccine or toxoid.
Immunization is a more inclusive term denoting the process of inducing or providing immunity
artificially by administering an immunobiologic. Immunization can be active or passive.
Active immunization is the production of antibody or other immune responses to the administration
of a vaccine or toxoid. Passive immunization means the provision of temporary immunity by the
administration of preformed antibodies. Three types of immunobiologics are administered for passive
immunization: 1) pooled human IG or IGIV, 2) specific IG preparations, and 3) antitoxins.
Vaccination and immunization are used interchangeably in ACIP statements in reference to active
immunization. Regardless of which term is used, administration of an immunobiologic cannot be
automatically equated with the development of adequate immunity for a variety of reasons, many of
which are discussed below.
IMMUNOBIOLOGICS
The specific nature and content of immunobiologics can differ. When immunobiologics against the
same infectious agents are produced by different manufacturers, active and inert ingredients in the
various products are not always the same. Practitioners are urged to become familiar with the
constituents of the products they use.
Suspending Fluids
These may be sterile water or saline or complex fluids containing small amounts of protein or other
constituents derived from the medium or biologic system in which the vaccine is produced (e.g., serum
proteins, egg antigens, cell-culture-derived antigens).
Preservatives, Stabilizers, Antibiotics
These components of vaccines, antitoxins, and globulins are used to inhibit or prevent bacterial
growth in viral cultures or the final product or to stabilize the antigens or antibodies. Allergic reactions
can occur if the recipient is sensitive to one of these additives (e.g., mercurials, phenols, albumin,
glycine).
Adjuvants
Many antigens evoke insufficient immunologic responses when given in their natural state. Efforts
to enhance immunogenicity include mixing antigens with a variety of substances or adjuvants (e.g.,
aluminum adjuvants such as aluminum phosphate).
ROUTE, SITE, AND TECHNIQUE OF IMMUNIZATION
Route
Routes of administration are recommended for each immunobiologic (Table 1). To avoid unneces-
sary local or systemic effects and/or to ensure optimal efficacy, the practitioner should not deviate from
the recommended routes. Vaccines containing adjuvants must be injected deep into the muscle mass;
they should not be administered subcutaneously or intradermally because they can cause local
irritation, inflammation, granuloma formation, or necrosis.
Site
Injectable immunobiologics should be administered where there is little likelihood of local, neural,
vascular, or tissue injury. Subcutaneous injections are usually administered into the thigh of infants
3


## p. 4 (#14) ###############################################

and in the deltoid area of older children and adults. Intradermal injections are generally given on the
volar surface of the forearm except for human diploid cell rabies vaccine with which reactions are less
severe in the deltoid area. The preferred sites for intramuscular injections are the anterolateral aspect
of the upper thigh and the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. In most infants, the anterolateral aspect of
the thigh provides the largest muscle mass and is therefore the preferred site. An individual decision
must be made for each child based on the volume of the material to be administered and the size of
the muscle into which it is to be injected. In adults, the deltoid is recommended for routine
intramuscular vaccine administration, particularly for hepatitis B vaccine. The buttock should not be
used routinely as a vaccination site for infants, children, or adults because of the risk of injury to the
sciatic nerve. In addition, injection into the buttock has been associated with decreased immunoge-
nicity of hepatitis B and rabies vaccines, presumably because of inadvertent subcutaneous injection or
injection into deep fat tissue. If the buttock is used when very large volumes are to be injected or
multiple doses are necessary (e.g., large doses of iG), the central region should be avoided; only the
upper, outer quadrant should be used.
Techniques
Syringes and needles used for injections must be sterile and preferably disposable to minimize the
risk of contamination. For an intramuscular injection, the needle and syringe should be of sufficient
length and bore to reach the muscle mass itself and prevent vaccine from seeping into subcutaneous
tissue. For children, a 20- or 22-gauge needle 1 to 1/4 inches long is recommended. For small infants,
a 25-gauge 5/8-inch-long needle may be adequate. For adults, the suggested needle length is 192
inches. For subcutaneous or intradermal injections, a 25-gauge needle 5/83/4 inches long is recom-
mended.
Before the injection is given, the needle is inserted in the site and the syringe plunger pulled back;
if blood appears, the needle should be withdrawn and a new site selected. The process should be
repeated until no blood appears. A separate needle and syringe should be used for each vaccine
injected. Disposable needles and syringes should be discarded into labeled, puncture-proof containers
to prevent accidental needlesticks or reuse. If more than one vaccine preparation is administered or if
vaccine and IG are administered simultaneously, each should be given at a different site.
DOSAGE
The recommendations on dosages of immunobiologics are derived from theoretical considerations,
experimental trials, and clinical experience. Administration of volumes smaller than those recom-
mended, such as split doses or intradermal administration (unless specifically recommended), can
result in inadequate protection. Use of larger than the recommended dose can be hazardous because
of excessive local or systemic concentrations of antigens.
The ACIP strongly discourages any variation from the recommended volume or number of doses of
any vaccine. Some practitioners use smaller, divided, doses of vaccine, thereby reducing the total
immunizing dose. Others use multiple smaller doses that together equal a full immunizing dose (e.g.,
diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP]) in an effort to reduce reactions. However,
the serologic response, clinical efficacy, and/or frequency and severity of adverse reactions of such
schedules have not been adequately studied.
AGE AT WHICH IMMUNOBIOLOGICS ARE ADMINISTERED
Several factors influence recommendations concerning the age at which vaccines are administered
(Table 2); they are age-specific risks of disease, age-specific risks of complications, ability of persons
of a given age to respond to the vaccine(s), and potential interference with the immune response by
passively transferred maternal antibody. In general, vaccines are recommended for the youngest age
group at risk whose members are known to develop an acceptable antibody response to vaccination.
SPACING OF IMMUNOBIOLOGICS
Multiple Doses of Same Antigen
Some products require administration of more than one dose for development of an adequate
antibody response. In addition, some products require periodic reinforcement (booster) doses to
maintain protection. In recommending the ages and/or intervals for multiple doses, the ACIP takes into
account risks from disease and the need to induce or maintain satisfactory protection (Tables 2, 3, and
4).
Intervals between doses that are longer than those recommended do not lead to a reduction in final
antibody levels. Therefore, it is not necessary to restart an inter-rupted series of an immunobiologic or
to add extra doses.

## p. 5 (#15) ###############################################

In contrast, giving doses of a vaccine or toxoid at less than recommended intervals may lessen the
antibody response and therefore should be avoided. Doses given at less than recommended intervals
should not be counted as part of a primary series.
Some vaccines produce local or systemic symptoms in certain recipients when given too frequently
(e.g., Td, DT, and rabies). Such reactions are thought to result from the formation of antigen-antibody
complexes. Good recordkeeping, careful patient histories, and adherence to recommended schedules
can decrease the incidence of such reactions without sacrificing immunity.
Different Antigens
Experimental evidence and extensive clinical experience have strengthened the scientific basis for
giving certain vaccines at the same time. Many of the widely used vaccines can safely and effectively

children 6 through 11 months old may be immunized with single-antigen measles vaccine. These children should
be reimmunized with MMR when they are approximately 15 months of age.
For all products used, consult the manufacturers' package enclosures for instructions regarding storage,
handling, dosage, and administration. Immunobiologics prepared by different manufacturers can vary, and those
of the same manufacturer can change from time to time. The package inserts are useful references for specific
products, but they may not always be consistent with current ACIP and American Academy of Pediatrics
immunization schedules.
DTP=Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Pertussis Vaccine, Adsorbed. DTP may be used up to the seventh
birthday. The first dose can be given at 6 weeks of age and the second and third doses given 4-8 weeks after the
preceding dose.
**OPV=Poliovirus Vaccine Live Oral, Trivalent: contains poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3.
**Provided at least 6 months have elapsed since DTP#3 or, if fewer than 3 doses of DTP have been received, at
least 6 weeks since the last previous dose of DTP or OPV. MMR vaccine should not be delayed to allow
simultaneous administration with DTP and OPV. Administering MMR at 15 months and DTP#4 and OPV#3 at 18
months continues to be an acceptable alternative.
$SMMR = Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine, Live. Counties that report >5 cases of measles among
preschool children during each of the last 5 years should implement a routine 2-dose measles vaccination
schedule for preschoolers. The first dose should be administered at 9 months or the first health-care contact
thereafter. Infants vaccinated before their first birthday should receive a second dose at about 15 months of age.
Single-antigen measles vaccine should be used for children aged <1 year and MMR for children vaccinated on or
after their first birthday. If resources do not allow a routine 2-dose schedule, an acceptable alternative is to lower
the routine age for MMR vaccination to 12 months.
"THDCV=Vaccine composed of Haemophilus influenzae b polysaccharide antigen conjugated to a protein carrier.
Children <5 years of age previously vaccinated with polysaccharide vaccine between the ages of 18 and 23
months should be revaccinated with a single dose of conjugate vaccine if at least 2 months have elapsed since the
receipt of the polysaccharide vaccine.
***If HbCV is not available, an acceptable alternative is to give Haemophilus influenzae b polysaccharide vaccine
(HbPV) at age >24 months. Children at high risk for Haemophilus influenzae type b disease where conjugate
vaccine is not available may be vaccinated with HbPV at 18 months of age and revaccinated at 24 months.

be given simultaneously (i.e., on the same day, not at the same site). This knowledge is particularly
helpful when there is imminent exposure to several infectious diseases, preparation for foreign travel,
or uncertainty that the person will return for further doses of vaccine.
1. Simultaneous administration
In general, inactivated vaccines can be administered simultaneously at separate sites. How-
ever, when vaccines commonly associated with local or systemic side effects (e.g., cholera,
typhoid, and plague) are given simultaneously, the side effects can be accentuated. Whenever
possible, these vaccines should be given on separate occasions.
Simultaneous administration of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and whole-virus influ-
enza vaccine elicits satisfactory antibody responses without increasing the incidence or severity
of adverse reactions. Simultaneous administration of the pneumococcal vaccine and split-virus
influenza vaccine can also be expected to yield satisfactory results. Influenza vaccine should be
administered annually to the target population.
In general, simultaneous administration of the most widely used live and inactivated vaccines
has not resulted in impaired antibody responses or increased rates of adverse reactions.
Administration of combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine yields results similar to
administration of individual measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines at different sites. Therefore,
there is no medical basis for giving these vaccines separately for routine immunization instead of
the preferred MMR combined vaccine.
There are equivalent antibody responses and no clinically significant increases in the frequency
of adverse events when DTP, MMR, and oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV)
are administered either simultaneously at different sites or separately. As a result, routine

## p. 7 (#17) ###############################################

simultaneous administration of MMR, DTP, and OPV (or IPV) to all children >15 months who are
eligible to receive these vaccines is recommended. Administration of MMR at 15 months followed
by DTP and OPV (or IPV) at 18 months remains an acceptable alternative, especially for children
with caregivers known to be generally compliant with other health-care recommendations. Data
are lacking on concomitant administration of Haemophilus influenzae b conjugate vaccine (HbCV)
or Haemophilus influenzae b polysaccharide vaccine (HDPV) and MMR and OPV vaccine. If the
child might not be brought back for future immunizations, the simultaneous administration of all
vaccines (including DTP, OPV, MMR, and HbCV or HbPV) appropriate to the age and previous
vaccination status of the recipient is recommended. Hepatitis B vaccine given with DTP and OPV
or given with yellow fever vaccine is as safe and efficacious as these vaccines administered
separately.
The antibody responses of both cholera and yellow fever vaccines are decreased if given
simultaneously or within a short time of each other. If possible, cholera and yellow fever
vaccinations should be separated by at least 3 weeks. If there are time constraints and both
vaccines are necessary, the injections can be given simultaneously or within a 3-week period with
the understanding that antibody response may not be optimal. Decisions on the need for yellow
fever and cholera immunizations should take into account the amount of protection afforded by
the vaccine, the possibility that environmental or hygienic practices may be sufficient to avoid
disease exposure, and the existence of vaccination requirements for entry into a country.
2. Nonsimultaneous administration
Inactivated vaccines do not interfere with the immune response to other inactivated vaccines
or to live vaccines except, as noted above, with cholera and yellow fever vaccines. In general, an
inactivated vaccine can be given either simultaneously or at any time before or after a different
inactivated vaccine or a live vaccine.
There are theoretical concerns that the immune response to one live-virus vaccine might be
impaired if given within 30 days of another. Whenever possible, live-virus vaccines not
administered on the same day should be given at least 30 days apart (Table 5).
Live-virus vaccines can interfere with the response to a tuberculin test. Tuberculin testing can
be done either on the same day that live-virus vaccines are administered or 4-6 weeks afterwards.
Immune Globulin
If administration of an IG preparation becomes necessary because of imminent exposure to disease,
live-virus vaccines can be given simultaneously with the IG product, with the recognition that

of Td to complete a primary series for tetanus and diphtheria).
*OPV=Poliovirus Vaccine Live Oral, Trivalent: contains poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3. When polio vaccine is to be
given to persons >18 years, Poliovirus Vaccine Inactivated (IPV) is preferred. See ACIP statement on polio vaccine
for immunization schedule for IPV (2).
$MMR= Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine, Live. Persons born before 1957 can generally be considered
immune to measles and mumps and need not be immunized. Since medical personnel are at higher risk for
acquiring measles than the general population, medical facilities may wish to consider requiring proof of measles
immunity for employees born before 1957. Rubella vaccine can be given to persons of any age, particularly to
nonpregnant women of childbearing age. MMR can be used since administration of vaccine to persons already
immune is not deleterious (see text for discussion of single vaccines versus combination).
7


## p. 8 (#18) ###############################################

vaccine-induced immunity might be compromised. The vaccine should be administered at a site
remote from that chosen for the IG inoculation. Vaccination should be repeated about 3 months later
unless serologic testing indicates that specific antibodies have been produced. OPV and yellow fever
vaccines are exceptions, however, and are not affected by administration of IG at any time.
Live, attenuated vaccine viruses might not replicate successfully, and antibody response could be
diminished when the vaccine is given after IG or specific IG preparations. Whole blood or other
antibody-containing blood products can interfere with the antibody response to measles, mumps, and
rubella vaccines. In general, these parenterally administered live vaccines should not be given for at
least 6 weeks, and preferably 3 months, after IG administration. However, the postpartum vaccination
of susceptible women with rubella vaccine should not be delayed because of receipt of anti-Rho(D) IG
(human) or any other blood product during the last trimester of pregnancy or at delivery. These women
should be vaccinated immediately after delivery and, if possible, tested in 3 months to ensure that
rubella immunity was established.
If administration of IG preparations becomes necessary after a live-virus vaccine has been given,
interference can occur. Usually, vaccine virus replication and stimulation of immunity will occur 1-2
weeks after vaccination. Thus, if the interval between administration of live-virus vaccine and
subsequent administration of an IG preparation is <14 days, vaccination should be repeated at least 3
months after the IG product was given, unless serologic testing indicates that antibodies were
produced.
In general, there is little interaction between IG preparations and inactivated vaccines. Therefore,
inactivated vaccines can be given simultaneously or at any time before or after an IG product is used.
For example, postexposure prophylaxis with simultaneously administered hepatitis B, rabies, or
tetanus IG and the corresponding inactivated vaccine or toxoid does not impair the immune response
and provides immediate protection and long-lasting immunity. The vaccine and IG should be given at
different sites, and standard doses of the corresponding vaccine should be used. Increasing the
vaccine dose volume or number of immunizations is not indicated (Table 6).
HYPERSENSITIVITY TO VACCINE COMPONENTS
Vaccine components can cause allergic reactions in some recipients. These reactions can be local or
systemic, including mild to severe anaphylaxis (e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty
breathing, hypotension, or shock). The responsible vaccine components can derive from: 1) animal
protein, 2) antibiotics, 3) preservatives, and 4) stabilizers. The most common animal protein allergen
is egg protein found in vaccines prepared using embryonated chicken eggs or chicken embryo cell
cultures (e.g., yellow fever, mumps, measles, and influenza vaccines). Ordinarily, persons who are able
to eat eggs or egg products safely can receive these vaccines; persons with histories of anaphylactic
allergy to eggs or egg proteins should not.
Asking persons whether they can eat eggs without adverse effects is a reasonable way to screen for
those who might be at risk from receiving measles, mumps, yellow fever, and influenza vaccines.
Protocols requiring extreme caution have been developed for testing and vaccinating with measles
and mumps vaccines those persons with anaphylactic reactions to egg ingestion (4). A regimen for
administering influenza vaccine to children with egg hypersensitivity and severe asthma has also been
developed (5).

*Cholera vaccine with yellow fever vaccine is the exception. If time permits, these antigens should not be
administered simultaneously, and at least 3 weeks should elapse between administration of yellow fever vaccine
and cholera vaccine. If the vaccines must be given simultaneously or within 3 weeks of each other, the antibody
response may not be optimal.

## p. 9 (#19) ###############################################

Rubella vaccine is grown in human diploid cell cultures and can safely be given to persons with
histories of severe allergy to eggs or egg proteins.
Some vaccines contain trace amounts of antibiotics to which patients may be hypersensitive. The
information provided in the vaccine package insert should be carefully reviewed before a decision is
made whether the rare patient with such hypersensitivity should be given the vaccine(s). No currently
recommended vaccine contains penicillin or its derivatives.
MMR and its individual component vaccines contain trace amounts of neomycin. Although the
amount present is less than would usually be used for the skin test to determine hypersensitivity,
persons who have experienced anaphylactic reactions to neomycin should not be given these
vaccines. Most often, neomycin allergy is a contact dermatitis, a manifestation of a delayed-type
(cell-mediated) immune response rather than anaphylaxis. A history of delayed-type reactions to
neomycin is not a contraindication for these vaccines.
Bacterial vaccines, such as cholera, DTP, plague, and typhoid, are frequently associated with local
or systemic adverse effects, such as redness, soreness, and fever. These reactions are difficult to link
with a specific sensitivity to vaccine components and appear to be toxic rather than hypersensitive. On
rare occasions, urticarial or anaphylactic reactions in DTP, DT, or Td recipients have been reported.
When such events are reported, appropriate skin tests should be performed to determine sensitivity to
tetanus toxoid before its use is discontinued (6).
ALTERED IMMUNOCOMPETENCE
Virus replication after administration of live, attenuated-virus vaccines can be enhanced in persons
with immunodeficiency diseases and in persons with suppressed capacity for immune response as
occurs with leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, symptomatic HIV infections, or therapy
with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large amounts of corticosteroids. Severe compli-
cations have followed vaccination with live, attenuated-virus vaccines and with live-bacteria vaccines
(e.g., BCG) in patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or suppressed immune responses. In general, these
patients should not be given live vaccines, with the exceptions noted below.
If polio immunization is indicated for immunosuppressed patients, their household members, or
other close contacts, these persons should be given IPV rather than OPV. Although a protective
immune response cannot be assured in the immunocompromised patient, some protection may be
provided. Because of the possibility of immunodeficiency in other children born to a family in which
one such case has occurred, no family members should receive OPV unless the immune statuses of the
intended recipient and all other children in the family are known.
Patients with leukemia in remission whose chemotherapy has been terminated for at least 3 months
can be given live-virus vaccines. Short-term, low-to-moderate dose systemic corticosteroid therapy
(<2 weeks), topical steroid therapy (e.g., nasal, skin), long-term alternate-day treatment with low to

moderate doses of short-acting systemic steroids, and intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injection with
corticosteroids are not immunosuppressive in their usual doses and do not contraindicate live-virus
vaccine administration.
The growing number of infants and preschoolers infected with HIV has directed special attention to
the appropriate immunization of such children. The evaluation and testing for HIV infection of
asymptomatic children presenting for vaccines is not necessary before decisions concerning immu-
nization are made. The inactivated childhood vaccines (e.g., DTP or HbCV) should be given to
HIV-infected children regardless of whether HIV symptoms are present. Although OPV has not been
harmful when administered to asymptomatic HIV-infected children, IPV is the vaccine of choice if the
child is known to be infected. The use of IPV not only eliminates any theoretical risk to the vaccinee but
also prevents the possibility of vaccine virus spread to immunocompromised close contacts. Asymp-
tomatically infected persons in need of MMR should receive it. Also, MMR should be considered for all
symptomatic HIV-infected children since measles disease can be severe in symptomatic HIV-infected
children. Limited studies of MMR immunization in both asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV-infected
patients have not documented serious or unusual adverse events. In addition, pneumococcal vaccine
is recommended for any child infected with HIV. Influenza vaccine is recommended for children with
symptoms of HIV infection (Table 7).
FEBRILE ILLNESS
The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of a current or recent febrile illness depends
largely on the severity of symptoms and on the etiology of the disease.
Although a moderate or severe febrile illness is reason to postpone immunizations, minor illnesses
such as mild upper-respiratory infections (URI) with or without low-grade fever are not contraindica-
tions for vaccination. In persons whose compliance with medical care cannot be assured, it is
particularly important to take every opportunity to provide appropriate vaccinations.
Children with moderate or severe febrile illnesses can be vaccinated as soon as the child has
recovered. This precaution to wait avoids superimposing adverse effects of the vaccine on the
underlying illness or mistakenly attributing a manifestation of the underlying illness to the vaccine.
Routine physical examinations or measuring temperatures are not prerequisites for vaccinating
infants and children who appear to be in good health. Asking the parent or guardian if the child is ill,
postponing vaccination in those with moderate or severe febrile illnesses, and immunizing those
without contraindications to vaccination are appropriate procedures in childhood immunization
programs.
VACCINATION DURING PREGNANCY
Because of a theoretical risk to the developing fetus, pregnant women or women likely to become
pregnant within 3 months after vaccination should not be given live, attenuated-virus vaccines. With
some of these vaccines - particularly rubella, measles, and mumps - pregnancy is a contraindication.
Both yellow fever vaccine and OPV, however, can be given to pregnant women who are at substantial
risk of exposure to natural infection. When a vaccine is to be given during pregnancy, waiting until the

second or third trimester is a reasonable precaution to minimize concern over teratogenicity. Although
there are theoretical risks, there is no evidence of congenital rubella syndrome in infants born to
susceptible mothers who inadvertently were given rubella vaccine during pregnancy.
Persons given measles, mumps, or rubella vaccines can shed but not transmit these viruses. These
vaccines can be administered safely to the children of pregnant women. Although live polio virus is
shed by persons recently immunized with OPV (particularly after the first dose), this vaccine can also
be administered to the children of pregnant women because experience has not revealed any risk of
polio vaccine virus to the fetus.
There is no convincing evidence of risk to the fetus from immunizing the pregnant woman with
inactivated virus or bacteria vaccines or toxoids. Previously immunized pregnant women who have not
received a Td immunization within the last 10 years should receive a booster dose once past the first
trimester. Women who are unimmunized or only partially immunized against tetanus should complete
as much of the primary series as possible during the last two trimesters of the pregnancy. Depending
on when the woman seeks prenatal care and the required interval between doses, one or two doses of
Td can be administered before delivery. Eligible women who do not complete the required three-dose
series during pregnancy should be followed after delivery to assure they receive the doses necessary
for protection.
All pregnant women should be evaluated for immunity to rubella. Women susceptible to rubella
should be immunized immediately after delivery. In addition, a woman's status as a carrier of hepatitis
B should also be assessed during pregnancy. A woman infected with hepatitis B virus should be
followed carefully so that her child can receive HBIG and the hepatitis B vaccine series shortly after
delivery.
There is no known risk to the fetus from passive immunization of pregnant women with IG. Further
information regarding immunization of pregnant women is available in the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists Technical Bulletin Number 64, May 1982.
MISCONCEPTIONS CONCERNING CONTRAINDICATIONS TO VACCINATION
Some health-care providers inappropriately consider certain conditions or circumstances contrain-
dications to vaccination. Conditions most often inappropriately regarded as routine contraindications
include the following:
1. Reaction to a previous dose of DTP vaccine that involved only soreness, redness, or swelling in
the immediate vicinity of the vaccination site or temperature of <105 F (40.5 C).
2. Mild acute illness with low-grade fever or mild diarrheal illness in an otherwise well child.
3. Current antimicrobial therapy or the convalescent phase of illnesses.
4. Prematurity. The appropriate age for initiating immunizations in the prematurely born infant is
the usual chronologic age. Vaccine doses should not be reduced for preterm infants.
5. Pregnancy of mother or other household contact.
6. Recent exposure to an infectious disease.
7. Breastfeeding. The only vaccine virus that has been isolated from breast milk is rubella vaccine
virus. There is no good evidence that breast milk from women immunized against rubella is
harmful to infants.
8. A history of nonspecific allergies or relatives with allergies.
9. Allergies to penicillin or any other antibiotic, except anaphylactic reactions to neomycin (e.g.,
MMR-containing vaccines) or streptomycin (e.g., OPV). None of the vaccines licensed in the
United States contain penicillin.
10. Allergies to duck meat or duck feathers. No vaccine available in the United States is produced
in substrates containing duck antigens.
11. Family history of convulsions in persons considered for pertussis or measles vaccination (7,8).
12. Family history of sudden infant death syndrome in children considered for DTP vaccination.
13. Family history of an adverse event, unrelated to immunosuppression, following vaccination.
ADVERSE EVENTS FOLLOWING VACCINATION
Modern vaccines are safe and effective but not completely so. Adverse events have been reported
following the administration of all vaccines. These events range from frequent, minor, local reactions
to extremely rare, severe, systemic illness, such as paralysis associated with OPV. It is often impossible
to establish evidence for cause-and-effect relationships when untoward events occur after vaccination
because temporal association alone does not necessarily indicate causation. More complete informa-
tion on adverse reactions to a specific vaccine may be found in the ACIP recommendations for each
vaccine.
11.


## p. 12 (#22) ##############################################

The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program established by the National Childhood Vaccine
Injury Act of 1986 requires physicians and other health-care providers who administer vaccines to
maintain permanent immunization records and to report occurrences of certain adverse events to the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Recording and reporting requirements took effect on
March 21, 1988. Reportable reactions include those listed in the Act for each vaccine (9,10 ) and events
specified in the manufacturer's vaccine package insert as contraindications to further doses of that
vaccine.
Although there will be one system for reporting adverse events following immunizations in the
future, at present there are two separate systems. The appropriate method depends on the source of
funding used to purchase the vaccine. Events that occur after receipt of a vaccine purchased with
public (federal, state, and/or local government) funds must be reported by the administering health
provider to the appropriate local, county, or state health department. The state health department
completes and submits the correct forms to CDC. Reportable events that follow administration of
vaccines purchased with private money are reported by the health-care provider directly to the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).
PATIENT INFORMATION
Parents, the responsible caregiver, or adult patients should be informed about the benefits and risks
of vaccine in understandable language. Ample opportunity for questions and answers should be
provided before each immunization. CDC has developed "Important Information Statements" for use
with federally purchased vaccines given in public health clinics, but similar statements have not been
universally adopted for the private medical-care sector.
An Important Information Statement must be developed for each vaccine covered by the National
Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (DTP or component antigens, MMR or component antigens, IPV, and
OPV). These statements are to be used by all public and private providers of vaccines. Until the
Important Information Statements established by the Act become available, the current CDC Important
Information Statements should be used in public health clinics and other settings where publicly
purchased vaccines are used. The use of similar statements in the private sector is encouraged.
VACCINE PROGRAMS
The best way to reduce vaccine-preventable diseases is to have a highly immune population.
Universal immunization is an important part of good health care and should be accomplished through
routine and intensive programs carried out in physicians' offices and in public health clinics. Programs
aimed at ensuring that all children are immunized at the recommended ages should be established and
maintained in all communities. In addition, appropriate immunizations should be available for all
adults.
Every visit to a health-care provider is an opportunity to update a patient's immunization status with
needed vaccines. All adults should complete a primary series of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, then
receive a booster dose every 10 years. Persons >65 years old and all adults with medical conditions
that place them at risk for pneumococcal disease or serious complications of influenza should receive
one dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and annual injections of influenza vaccine. In
addition, immunization programs for adults should provide MMR vaccine whenever possible to
anyone believed susceptible to measles, mumps, or rubella. Use of MMR ensures that the recipient has
been immunized against three different diseases and causes no harm if the vaccinee is already
immune to one or more of its components.
Official health agencies should take necessary steps, including developing and enforcing school
immunization requirements, to assure that students at all grade levels, including college students, and
those in child-care centers are protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. Agencies should also
encourage institutions such as hospitals and extended-care facilities to adopt policies regarding the
appropriate immunization of residents and employees.
Dates of immunization (day, month, and year) should be recorded on institutional immunization
records, such as those kept in schools and child-care centers. This will facilitate assessments that a
primary vaccine series has been completed according to an appropriate schedule and that needed
boosters have been obtained at the correct time.
Tickler or recall systems can identify children who are due for immunizations or are behind schedule
so parents can be contacted and reminded to have their children immunized. The ACIP recommends
the use of these systems by all health-care providers. Such systems should also be developed by
health-care providers who treat adults to ensure that at-risk persons receive influenza vaccine annually.

## p. 13 (#23) ##############################################

IMMUNIZATION RECORDS
Documentation of patient immunizations will help ensure that persons in need of vaccine receive it
and that adequately vaccinated patients are not overimmunized with increased risk of hypersensitivity
(e.g., tetanus toxoid hypersensitivity).
Patient's Personal Record
Official immunization cards have been adopted by every state and the District of Columbia to
encourage uniformity of records and to facilitate the assessment of immunization status by schools
and child-care centers. The records are also important tools in immunization education programs
aimed at increasing parental and patient awareness of the need for vaccines. A permanent immuni-
zation record card should be established for each newborn infant and maintained by the parent. In
many states, these cards are distributed to new mothers before discharge from the hospital.
Provider Records
The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program requires each health-care provider to record in
the vaccine recipient's permanent medical record (or in a permanent office log or file) the provider's
name, address, and title (if appropriate), the type of immunobiologic administered, the manufacturer,
lot number, and date of administration. Health-care provider is any licensed health-care professional,
organization, or institution, whether private or public (including federal, state, and local departments
and agencies), under whose authority a specified vaccine is administered. The vaccines covered under
this new law include: DTP and MMR (or any of their components given singly or in combination), OPV,
and IPV. A permanent immunization record should also be established and maintained for adults and
children who receive vaccines not covered by the National Vaccine Injury Act. The ACIP recommends
use of standard records that note the type, manufacturer, lot number, and date of administration for
each immunobiologic administered. Serologic test results for vaccine-preventable diseases, such as
those for rubella screening, as well as documented episodes of adverse events, should also be
recorded in the vaccine recipient's permanent medical record.
SOURCES OF VACCINE INFORMATION
In addition to these general recommendations, the practitioner can draw on a variety of sources for
specific data and updated information including:
Official vaccine package circulars. Manufacturer-provided product-specific information approved by
the FDA with each vaccine. Some of these materials are reproduced in the Physician's Desk Reference
(PDR).

Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis:
Recommendations for Vaccine Use
and Other Preventive Measures
Recommendations of the
Immunization Practices Advisory
Committee (ACIP)
This revision of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) statement on diphtheria,
tetanus, and pertussis updates the statement issued in 1985, and incorporates the 1987 supplementary
statement, which addressed two issues: a) the risks and benefits of pertussis vaccine for infants and
children with family histories of convulsions; and b) antipyretic use in conjunction with diphtheria and
tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine absorbed (DTP) vaccination among children with personal or
family histories of convulsions (1,2). This document presents new recommendations for epidemio-
logic investigation and management of contacts of diphtheria patients.
The updated recommendations include a review of the epidemiology of the three diseases and
descriptions of the available immunobiologic preparations with appropriate vaccination schedules.
Also included are a) new information on and reassessment of the possible relation between receipt of
DTP and the occurrence of serious acute neurologic illness and permanent brain damage, b) revisions
in the recommendations on precautions for and contraindications to pertussis vaccine use, and c)
revisions on recommendations for chemoprophylaxis for household and other close contacts of
pertussis patients.
The Committee has reviewed and taken into consideration the recent report by the Institute of
Medicine entitled, “Adverse Effects of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines" in making these recommen-
dations.
INTRODUCTION
Simultaneous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis during infancy and childhood
has been a routine practice in the United States since the late 1940s. This practice has played a major
role in markedly reducing the incidence of cases and deaths from each of these diseases.
DIPHTHERIA
At one time, diphtheria was common in the United States. More than 200,000 cases, primarily
among children, were reported in 1921. Approximately 5%-10% of cases were fatal; the highest
case-fatality ratios were recorded for the very young and the elderly. Reported cases of diphtheria of
all types declined from 306 in 1975 to 59 in 1979; most were cutaneous diphtheria reported from a
single state (3). After 1979, cutaneous diphtheria was no longer notifiable. From 1980 to 1989, only 24
cases of respiratory diphtheria were reported; two cases were fatal, and 18 (75%) occurred among
persons >20 years of age.
Diptheria is currently a rare disease in the United States primarily because of the high level of
appropriate vaccination among children (97% of children entering school have received three doses
of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP]) and because of an apparent reduction
in the circulation of toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Most cases occur among
unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated persons. The age distribution of recent cases and the results
of serosurveys indicate that many adults in the United States are not protected against diphtheria.
Limited serosurveys conducted since 1977 indicate that 22%-62% of adults 18-39 years of age and
41%-84% of those >60 years of age may lack protective levels of circulating antitoxin against
1

diphtheria (4-7). Thus, it appears that further reductions in the incidence of diphtheria would require
more emphasis on adult immunization programs. Both toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of C.
diphtheriae can cause disease, but only strains that produce toxin cause myocarditis and neuritis.
Furthermore, toxigenic strains are more often associated with severe or fatal illness in noncutaneous
(respiratory or other mucosal surface) infections and are more commonly recovered in association
with respiratory than from cutaneous infections.
C. diphtheriae can contaminate the skin, usually at the site of a wound. Although a sharply
demarcated lesion with a pseudomembranous base often results, the appearance may not be
distinctive, and infection can be confirmed only by culture. Usually other bacterial species can also be
isolated. Cutaneous diphtheria has most commonly affected indigent adults and certain groups of
American Indians.
A complete vaccination series substantially reduces the risk of developing diphtheria, and vacci-
nated persons who develop disease have milder illnesses. Protection lasts at least 10 years.
Vaccination does not, however, eliminate carriage of C. diphtheriae in the pharynx or nose or on the
skin.
TETANUS
The occurrence of tetanus in the United States has decreased dramatically from 560 reported cases
in 1947, when national reporting began, to a record low of 48 reported cases in 1987 (8). The decline
has resulted from widespread use of tetanus toxoid and improved wound management, including use
of tetanus prophylaxis in emergency rooms.
Tetanus in the United States is primarily a disease of older adults. Of 99 tetanus patients with
complete information reported to CDC during 1987 and 1988, 68% were >50 years of age, while only
six were <20 years of age. No cases of neonatal tetanus were reported. Overall, the case-fatality rate
was 21% (8). The age distribution of recent cases and the results of serosurveys indicate that many
U.S. adults are not protected against tetanus. Serosurveys undertaken since 1977 indicate that 6%-11%
of adults 18-39 years of age and 49%-66% of those >60 years of age may lack protective levels of
circulating tetanus antitoxin (4-7). The disease continues to occur almost exclusively among persons
who are unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated or whose vaccination histories are unknown or
uncertain (8).
Surveys of emergency rooms suggest that 1%-6% of all persons who receive medical care for
injuries that can lead to tetanus receive less than the recommended prophylaxis (9,10). In 1987-1988,
58% of tetanus patients with acute injuries did not seek medical care for their injuries; of those who did,
81% did not receive prophylaxis as recommended by ACIP guidelines (8).
In 4% of tetanus cases reported during 1987 and 1988, no wound or other condition was implicated.
Nonacute skin lesions such as ulcers, or medical conditions such as abscesses were reported in
association with 14% of cases.
Neonatal tetanus occurs among infants born under unhygienic conditions to inadequately vacci-
nated mothers. Vaccinated mothers confer protection to their infants through transplacental transfer of
maternal antibody. From 1972 through 1984, 29 cases of neonatal tetanus were reported in the United
States ( 11 ). No cases of neonatal tetanus were reported in the period 1985-1989. Spores of Clostridium
tetani are ubiquitous. Serologic tests indicate that naturally acquired immunity to tetanus toxin does
not occur in the United States. Thus, universal primary vaccination, with subsequent maintenance of
adequate antitoxin levels by means of appropriately timed boosters, is necessary to protect persons
among all age-groups. Tetanus toxoid is a highly effective antigen; a completed primary series
generally induces protective levels of serum antitoxin that persist for >10 years.
PERTUSSIS
Disease caused by Bordetella pertussis was once a major cause of infant and childhood morbidity
and mortality in the United States (12,13). Pertussis became a nationally notifiable disease in 1922, and
reports reached a peak of 265,269 cases and 7,518 deaths in 1934. The highest number of reported
pertussis deaths (9,269) occurred in 1923. The introduction and widespread use of standardized
2


## p. 3 (#31) ###############################################

whole-cell pertussis vaccines combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DTP) in the late 1940s
resulted in a substantial decline in pertussis disease, a decline which continued without interruption for
nearly 30 years.
By 1970, the annual reported incidence of pertussis had been reduced by 99%. During the 1970s, the
annual numbers of reported cases stabilized at an average of approximately 2,300 cases each year.
During the 1980s, however, the annual numbers of reported cases gradually increased from 1,730
cases in 1980 to 4,157 cases in 1989. An average of eight pertussis-associated fatalities was reported
each year throughout the 1980s. It is not clear whether the increase in reported pertussis reflects a true
increase in the incidence of the disease or improvement in the reporting of pertussis. However, these
data underestimate the true number of cases, because many are unrecognized or unreported, and
diagnostic tests for B. pertussis-culture and direct-immunofluorescence assay-may be unavailable,
difficult to perform, or incorrectly interpreted. Because direct-fluorescent-antibody testing of nasopha-
ryngeal secretions has been shown in some studies to have low sensitivity and variable specificity, it
should not be relied on as a criterion for laboratory confirmation ( 14,15). In addition, reporting criteria
have varied widely among the different states. Laboratory diagnosis based on serologic testing is not
widely available and is still considered experimental (16). In 1990, to improve the accuracy of
reporting, the U.S. Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists adopted uniform case definitions
for pertussis (17).
Before widespread use of DTP, <20% of cases and 50%-70% of pertussis deaths occurred among
children <1 year of age (13,18). For the period 1980-1989, 47% of reported illnesses from B. pertussis
occurred among children <1 year of age, and 72% occurred among children <5 years of age; 61 (77%)
of 79 deaths reported to CDC occurred among children <1 year of age (19). Infants <2 months of age
were at highest risk of complications, with a case-fatality rate of 1.3%. Although incidence based on
reported cases increased among all age-groups during the 1980s, the most striking increases occurred
among adolescents and adults (19). Whether this represented a true increase or more complete
recognition and reporting is not clear.
Pertussis is highly communicable (attack rates of >90% have been reported among unvaccinated
household contacts) and can cause severe disease, particularly among very young children. Of 10,749
patients <1 year of age reported nationally as having pertussis nationally during the period 1980-1989,
69% were hospitalized, 22% had pneumonia, 3.0% had zone seizure, 0.9% had encephalopathy, and
0.6% died (19). The high rate of hospitalization for infants with pertussis has been observed in several
population-based studies (20-22). Because of the substantial risks of complications of the disease,
completion of a primary series of DTP vaccine early in life is essential.
Among older children and adults, including those previously vaccinated, B. pertussis infection may
result in symptoms of bronchitis or upper-respiratory-tract infection. Pertussis may not be diagnosed
because classic signs, especially the inspiratory whoop, may be absent. Older preschool children and
school-age siblings who are not fully vaccinated and who develop pertussis can be important sources
of infection for infants <1 year of age. Adults also play an important role in the transmission of
pertussis to unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated infants and young children (23).
Controversy regarding the safety of pertussis vaccine during the 1970s led to several studies of the
benefits and risks of this vaccination during the 1980s. These epidemiologic analyses clearly indicate
that the benefits of pertussis vaccination outweigh any risks (24-28).
PREPARATIONS USED FOR VACCINATION
Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are prepared by formaldehyde treatment of the respective toxins and
are standardized for potency according to the regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The limit of flocculation (Lf) content of each toxoid (quantity of toxoid as assessed by flocculation) may
vary among different products. The concentration of diphtheria toxoid in preparations intended for
adult use is reduced because adverse reactions to diphtheria toxoid are apparently directly related to
the quantity of antigen and to the age or previous vaccination history of the recipient, and because a
smaller dosage of diphtheria toxoid produces an adequate immune response among adults.
Pertussis vaccine is a suspension of inactivated B. pertussis cells. Potency is assayed by comparison
with the U.S. standard pertussis vaccine in the intracerebral mouse protection test. The protective
efficacy of pertussis vaccines for humans has been shown to correlate with this measure of vaccine
potency.

## p. 4 (#32) ###############################################

Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine, as single antigens or various combinations,
are available as aluminum-salt-adsorbed preparations. Only tetanus toxoid is available in nonabsorbed
(fluid) form. Although the rates of seroconversion are essentially equivalent with either type of tetanus
toxoid, the adsorbed toxoid induces a more persistent level of antitoxin antibody. The following
preparations are currently available in the United States:
1. Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (DTP) and Diphtheria and
Tetanus Toxoids Adsorbed (DT) (for pediatric use) are for use among infants and children <7
years of age. Each 0.5-mL dose is formulated to contain 6.7-12.5 Lf units of diphtheria toxoid, 5
Lf units of tetanus toxoid, and <16 opacity units of pertussis vaccine. A single human immunizing
dose of DTP contains an estimated 4-12 protective units of pertussis vaccine.
2. Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids Adsorbed for Adult Use (Td) is for use among persons >7 years
of age. Each 0.5-mL dose is formulated to contain 2-10 Lf units of tetanus toxoid and <2 Lf units
of diphtheria toxoid.
3. Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed (P),* Tetanus Toxoid (fluid), Tetanus Toxoid Adsorbed (T), and
Diphtheria Toxoid Adsorbed (D)* (for pediatric use), are single-antigen products for use in special
instances when combined antigen preparations are not indicated.
Work is in progress to study the effectiveness of improved acellular pertussis vaccines that have
reduced adverse reaction rates. Currently, several candidate vaccines containing at least one of the
bacterial components thought to provide protection are undergoing clinical trials. Candidate antigens
include filamentous hemagglutinin, lymphocytosis promoting factor (pertussis toxin), a recently
identified 69-kiloDalton outer-membrane protein (pertactin), and agglutinogens (23). In published
studies, some of these vaccines are less prone to cause common adverse reactions than the current
whole-cell preparations, and they are immunogenic (29-36). Whether their clinical efficacy among
infants is equivalent to that of the whole-cell preparations remains to be established.
VACCINE USAGE
The standard, single-dose volume of each of DTP, DT, Td, single-antigen adsorbed preparations of
pertussis vaccine, tetanus toxoid, and diphtheria toxoid, and of the fluid tetanus toxoid is 0.5 mL.
Adsorbed preparations should be administered intramuscularly (IM). Vaccine administration by jet
injection may be associated with more frequent local reactions (37).

Primary Vaccination
Children 6 weeks through 6 years old (up to the seventh birthday)
Table 1 details a routine vaccination schedule for children <7 years of age. One dose of DTP should
be given IM on four occasions—the first three doses at 4-to 8-week intervals, beginning when the infant
is approximately 6 weeks-2 months old; customarily, doses of vaccine are given at 2, 4, and 6 months
of age. Individual circumstances may warrant giving the first three doses at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age
to provide protection as early as possible, especially during pertussis outbreaks (38). The fourth dose
is given approximately 6-12 months after the third dose to maintain adequate immunity during the
preschool years. This dose is an integral part of the primary vaccinating course. If a contraindication
to pertussis vaccination exists (see Precautions and Contraindications), DT should be substituted for
DTP as outlined (see Special Considerations).
Children >7 years of age and adults
Table 2 details a routine vaccination schedule for persons 27 years of age. Because the severity of
pertussis decreases with age, and because the vaccine may cause side effects and adverse reactions,
pertussis vaccination has not been recommended for children after their seventh birthday or for adults.
For primary vaccination, a series of three doses of Td should be given IM; the second dose is given 4-8
weeks after the first, and the third dose 6-12 months after the second. Td rather than DT is the
preparation of choice for vaccination of all persons >7 years of age because side effects from higher
doses of diphtheria toxoid are more common than they are among younger children.
Interruption of primary vaccination schedule
Interrupting the recommended schedule or delaying subsequent doses does not lead to a reduction
in the level of immunity reached on completion of the primary series. Therefore, there is no need to
restart a series if more than the recommended time between doses has elapsed.
Booster Vaccination
Children 4-6 years old (up to the seventh birthday)
Those who received all four primary vaccination doses before their fourth birthday should receive
a fifth dose of DTP before entering kindergarten or elementary school. This booster dose is not
necessary if the fourth dose in the primary series was given on or after the fourth birthday.
Children 7 years of age and adults
Tetanus toxoid should be given with diphtheria toxoid as Td every 10 years. If a dose is given sooner
as part of wound management, the next booster is not needed until 10 years thereafter. (See Tetanus
Prophylaxis in Wound Management). More frequent boosters are not indicated and can result in an
increased occurrence and severity of adverse reactions. One means of ensuring that persons receive
boosters every 10 years is to vaccinate them routinely at mid-decade ages, i.e., 15 years old, 25 years
old, 35 years old, etc.
Special Considerations
Children with contraindications to pertussis vaccination
For children <7 years of age with a contraindication to pertussis vaccine (see Precautions and
Contraindications), DT should be used instead of DTP. To ensure that there will be no interference with
the response to DT antigens from maternal antibodies, previously unvaccinated children who receive
their first DT dose when <1 year of age should receive a total of four doses of DT as the primary series,

the first three doses at 4-to 8-week intervals and the fourth dose 6-12 months later (similar to the
recommended DTP schedule) (Table 1). If additional doses of pertussis vaccine become contraindi-
cated after a DTP series is begun in the first year of life, DT should be substituted for each of the
remaining scheduled DTP doses.
Unvaccinated children 1 year of age for whom pertussis vaccine is contraindicated should receive
two doses of DT 4-8 weeks apart, followed by a third dose 6-12 months later to complete the primary
series. Children who have already received one or two doses of DT or DTP after their first birthday and
for whom further pertussis vaccine is contraindicated should receive a total of three doses of a
preparation containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoids appropriate for age, with the third dose
administered 6-12 months after the second dose.
Children who complete a primary series of DT before their fourth birthday should receive a fifth dose
of DT before entering kindergarten or elementary school. This dose is not necessary if the fourth dose
of the primary series was given after the fourth birthday.
Pertussis vaccination for persons >7 years of age
Routine vaccination against pertussis is not currently recommended for persons 7 years of age. It
should be noted, however, that adolescents and adults with waning immunity, whether derived from
disease or vaccination, are a major reservoir for transmission of pertussis (23). For this reason it is
possible that booster doses of acellular pertussis vaccine will be recommended in the future for
persons ages >7 years of age.
Persons who have recovered from tetanus or diphtheria
Tetanus or diphtheria infection may not confer immunity; therefore, active vaccination should be
initiated at the time of recovery from the illness, and arrangements made to ensure that all doses of a
primary series are administered on schedule.
Children who have recovered from pertussis
Children who have recovered from satisfactorily documented pertussis do not need pertussis
vaccine. Satisfactory documentation includes recovery of B. pertussis on culture or typical symptoms
and clinical course when epidemiologically linked to a culture-proven case, as may occur during
outbreaks. When such confirmation of the diagnosis is lacking, DTP vaccination should be completed,
because a presumed pertussis syndrome may have been caused by other Bordetella species,
Chlamydia, or certain viruses.
Prevention of neonatal tetanus
A previously unvaccinated pregnant woman whose child might be born under unhygienic circum-
stances (without sterile technique) should receive two doses of Td 4-8 weeks apart before delivery,
preferably during the last two trimesters. Pregnant women in similar circumstances who have not had
a complete vaccination series should complete the three-dose series. Those vaccinated more than 10
years previously should have a booster dose. No evidence exists to indicate that tetanus and diphtheria
toxoids administered during pregnancy are teratogenic.
Adult vaccination with Td
The proportions of persons lacking protective levels of circulating antitoxins against diphtheria and
tetanus increase with age; at least 40% of those >60 years of age may lack protection. Every visit of an
adult to a health-care provider should be regarded as an opportunity to assess the person's vaccination
status and, if indicated, to provide protection against tetanus and diphtheria. Adults with uncertain
histories of a complete primary vaccination series should receive a primary series using the combined
Td toxoid. To ensure continued protection, booster doses of Td should be given every 10 years.
Use of Single-Antigen Preparations
A single-antigen adsorbed pertussis vaccine preparation can be used to complete vaccination
against pertussis for children <7 years of age who have received fewer than the recommended
number of doses of pertussis vaccine but have received the recommended number of doses of
diphtheria and tetanus toxoids for their age. Alternately, DTP can be used, although the total number
of doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids should not exceed six each before the seventh birthday.
Available data do not indicate substantially more adverse reactions following receipt of Td than
following receipt of single-antigen, adsorbed tetanus toxoid. Furthermore, adults may be even less
6

likely to have adequate levels of diphtheria antitoxin than of tetanus antitoxin. The routine use of Td
in all medical settings, including office practices, clinics, and emergency rooms, for all persons >7
years of age who need primary vaccination or booster doses will improve levels of protection against
both tetanus and diphtheria, especially among adults.
SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS FOLLOWING DTP VACCINATION
Local reactions (generally erythema and induration with or without tenderness) are common after
the administration of vaccines containing diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis antigens. Occasionally, a
nodule may be palpable at the injection site of adsorbed products for several weeks. Sterile abscesses
at the injection site have been reported rarely (6-10/million doses of DTP). Mild systemic reactions such
as fever, drowsiness, fretfulness, and anorexia occur frequently. These reactions are substantially
more common following the administration of DTP than of DT, but they are self-limited and can be
safely managed with symptomatic treatment.
Acetaminophen is frequently given by physicians to lessen fever and irritability associated with DTP
vaccination, and it may be useful in preventing seizures among febrile-convulsion-prone children.
However, fever that does not begin until >24 hours after vaccination or persists for more than 24 hours
after vaccination should not be assumed to be due to DTP vaccination. These new or persistent fevers
should be evaluated for other causes so that treatment is not delayed for serious conditions such as
otitis media or meningitis. Moderate-to-severe systemic events, include high fever (i.e., temperature of
>40.5 C (105 F]); persistent, inconsolable crying lasting >3 hours; collapse (hypotonic-hyporesponsive
episode); or short-lived convulsions (usually febrile). These events occur infrequently. These events
appear to be without sequelae (39-41 ). Other more severe neurologic events, such as a prolonged
convulsion or encephalopathy, although rare, have been reported in temporal association with DTP
administration.
Approximate rates for the occurrence of adverse events following receipt of DTP vaccine (regardless
of dose number in the series or age of the child) are shown in Table 3 (42,43 ). The frequencies of local
reactions and fever are substantially higher with increasing numbers of doses of DTP vaccine, while
other mild-to-moderate systemic reactions (e.g., fretfulness, vomiting) are substantially less frequent
(41-43).
Concern about the possible role of pertussis vaccine in causing neurologic reactions has been
present since the earliest days of vaccine use. Rare but serious acute neurologic illnesses, including
encephalitis/encephalopathy and prolonged convulsions, have been anecdotally reported following
receipt of whole-cell pertussis vaccine given as DTP vaccine (28,44 ). Whether pertussis vaccine causes
or is only coincidentally related to such illnesses or reveals an inevitable event has been difficult to
determine conclusively for the following reasons: a) serious acute neurologic illnesses often occur or
become manifest among children during the first year of life irrespective of vaccination; b) there is no
specific clinical sign, pathological finding, or laboratory test which can determine whether the illness

is caused by the DTP vaccine; c) it may be difficult to determine with certainty whether infants <6
months of age are neurologically normal, which complicates assessment of whether vaccinees were
already neurologically impaired before receiving DTP vaccine; and d) because these events are
exceedingly rare, appropriately designed large studies are needed to address the question.
To determine whether DTP vaccine causes serious neurologic illness and brain damage, the
National Childhood Encephalopathy Study (NCES) was undertaken during 1976-1979 in Great Britain
(27,45-47). This large case-control study attempted to identity every patient with serious, acute,
childhood, neurologic illness admitted to a hospital in England, Scotland, and Wales. A total of 1,182
young children 2-36 months of age was identified. Excluding those with infantile spasms, an illness
shown in a separate analysis not to be attributable to DTP vaccine, 30 of these children (18 with
prolonged convulsions and 12 with encephalitis/encephalopathy) had received DTP vaccine within 7
days of the reported onset of their neurologic illness (48 ). Analysis of the data from these patients and
from age-matched control children showed a significant association (odds ratio=3.3; 95% confidence
interval 1.7–6.5) between the development of serious acute neurologic illness and receipt of DTP
vaccine. Most of these events were prolonged seizures with fever. The attributable risk for all
neurologic events was estimated to be 1:140,000 doses of DTP vaccine administered. These 30 children
were followed up for at least 12 months to determine whether they had neurologic sequelae. Seven of
these children presumed to have been previously normal neurologically had died or had subsequent
neurologic impairment. A causal relation between receipt of DTP vaccine and permanent neurologic
injury was suggested. The estimated attributable risk for DTP vaccine was 1:330,000 doses with a wide
confidence interval.
The methods and results of the NCES have been thoroughly scrutinized since publication of the
study. This reassessment by multiple groups has determined that the number of patients was too small
and their classification subject to enough uncertainty to preclude drawing valid conclusions about
whether a causal relation exists between pertussis vaccine and permanent neurologic damage
(49–54). Preliminary data from a 10-year follow-up study of some of the children studied in the original
NCES study also suggested a relation between symptoms following DTP vaccination and permanent
neurologic disability (55). However, details are not available to evaluate this study adequately, and the
same concerns remain about DTP vaccine precipating initial manifestations of pre-existing neurologic
disorders.
Subsequent studies have failed to provide evidence to support a causal relation between DTP
vaccination and either serious acute neurologic illness or permanent neurologic injury. These include:
a) the 1979 Hospital Activity Analysis of the North West Thames Study in England, in which the hospital
records of approximately 17,000 children who each received three doses of DTP vaccine were
compared with records of 18,000 children who each received three doses of DT vaccine; b) a 1974-1983
case-cohort study of children in the Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound who received a total of
106,000 doses of DTP vaccine; and c) a 1974-1984 cohort study of 38,171 Medicaid children in
Tennessee who received 107,154 doses of DTP vaccine (56-58 ). An additional study in Denmark of
approximately 150,000 children (554 of which had epilepsy) demonstrated no relation between the age
at onset of epilepsy and the scheduled age of administration of DTP vaccine (59). Although each of
these studies individually contained too few subjects to provide definitive conclusions, taken together
they stand in contrast to the original NCES findings. A recent study performed in 1987-1988 in
Washington and Oregon of neurologic illness among children did not provide evidence of a
significantly increased risk of all serious acute neurologic illnesses within 7, 14, or 28 days of DTP
vaccination (60 ). However, as a pilot effort, this study had limited power to detect significantly
increased risks for individual conditions.
The NCES was the basis of prior ACIP statements suggesting that on rare occasions DTP vaccine
could cause brain damage. However, on the basis of a more detailed review of the NCES data as well
as data from other studies, the ACIP has revised its earlier view and now concludes:
1. Although DTP may rarely produce symptoms that some have classified as acute encephalopathy,
a causal relation between DTP vaccine and permanent brain damage has not been demonstrated.
If the vaccine ever causes brain damage, the occurrence of such an event must be exceedingly
rare. A similar conclusion has been reached by the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the
American Academy of Pediatrics, the Child Neurology Society, the Canadian National Advisory
Committee on Immunization, the British Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization, the
British Pediatric Association, and the Institute of Medicine (49-54).

2. The risk estimate from the NCES study of 1:330,000 for brain damage should no longer be
considered valid on the basis of continuing analyses of the NCES and other studies.
In addition to these considerations, acute neurologic manifestations related to DTP vaccine are
mainly febrile seizures. In an individual case, the role of pertussis vaccine as a cause of serious acute
neurologic illness or permanent brain damage is impossible to determine on the basis of clinical or
laboratory findings. Anecdotal reports of DTP-induced acute neurologic disorders with or without
permanent brain damage can have one of several alternate explanations. Some instances may
represent simple coincidence because DTP is administered at a time in infancy when previously
unrecognized underlying neurological and developmental disorders first become manifest. Some
patients may have short-lived seizures with prompt recovery, and these events represent the first
seizure of a child with underlying epilepsy. When epilepsy has its onset in infancy, it is frequently
associated with severe mental retardation and developmental delay. These conditions become
apparent over a period of several months. The known febrile and other systemic effects of DTP
vaccination may stimulate or precipitate inevitable symptoms of underlying central-nervous-system
disorders, particularly since DTP may be the first pyrogenic stimulus an infant receives. When children
who experience acute, severe central-nervous-system disorders in association with DTP vaccination
are studied promptly and carefully, an alternate cause is often found.
Among a subset of NCES children with infantile spasms, both DTP and DT vaccination appeared
either to precipitate early manifestations of the condition or to cause its recognition by parents (48 ).
This and other studies suggest that neither vaccine causes this illness (59,61 ).
Approximately 5,200 infants succumb to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the United States
each year. Because the peak incidence of SIDS for infants is between 2 and 3 months of age, many
instances of a close temporal relation between SIDS and receipt of DTP are to be expected by simple
chance. Only one methodologically rigorous study has suggested that DTP vaccine might cause SIDS
(62). A total of four deaths were reported within 3 days of DTP vaccination, compared with 1.36
expected deaths. However, these deaths were unusual in that three of the four occurred within a
13-month interval during the 12-year study. These four children also tended to be vaccinated at older
ages than their controls, suggesting that they might have other unrecognized risk factors for SIDS
independent of vaccination. In contrast, DTP vaccination was not associated with SIDS in several larger
studies performed in the past decade (28,63-65 ). In addition, none of three studies that examined
unexpected deaths among infants not classified as SIDS found an association with DTP vaccination
(62,64,65).
Claims that DTP may be responsible for transverse myelitis, other more subtle neurologic disorders
(such as hyperactivity, learning disorders and infantile autism), and progressive degenerative central-
nervous-system conditions have no scientific basis. Furthermore, one study indicated that children
who received pertussis vaccine exhibited fewer school problems than those who did not, even after
adjustment for socioeconomic status (66 ).
Recent data suggest that infants and young children who have ever had convulsions (febrile or
afebrile) or who have immediate family members with such histories are more likely to have seizures
following DTP vaccination than those without such histories (67,68 ). For those with a family history of
seizures, the increased risks of seizures occurring within 3 days of receipt of DTP or 4-28 days following
receipt of DTP are identical, suggesting that these histories are non-specific risk factors and are
unrelated to DTP vaccination (68).
Rarely, immediate anaphylactic reactions (i.e., swelling of the mouth, breathing difficulty, hypoten-
sion, or shock) have been reported after receipt of preparations containing diphtheria, tetanus, and/or
pertussis antigens. However, no deaths caused by anaphylaxis following DTP vaccination have been
reported to CDC since the inception of vaccine-adverse-events reporting in 1978, a period during which
more than 80 million doses of publically purchased DTP vaccine were administered. While substantial
underreporting exists in this passive surveillance system, the severity of anaphylaxis and its
immediacy following vaccination suggest that such events are likely to be reported. Although no
causal relation to any specific component of DTP has been established, the occurrence of true
anaphylaxis usually contraindicates further doses of any one of these components. Rashes that are
macular, papular, petechial, or urticarial and appear hours or days after a dose of DTP are frequently
antigen-antibody reactions of little consequence or are due to other causes such as viral illnesses, and
are unlikely to recur following subsequent injections (69,70). In addition, there is no evidence for a
causal relation between DTP vaccination and hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenic purpura.

REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has established a new Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) to accept all reports of suspected adverse events after the administration
of any vaccine, including but not limited to the reporting of events required by the National Childhood
Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (71 ).The telephone number to call for answers to questions and to obtain
VAERS forms is 1-800-822-7967.
The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, established by the National Childhood Vaccine
Injury Act of 1986, requires physicians and other health-care providers who administer vaccines to
maintain permanent vaccination records and to report occurrences of certain adverse events to the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. These requirements took effect March 21, 1988.
Reportable events include those listed in the Act for each vaccine and events specified in the
manufacturer's vaccine package insert as contraindications to further doses of that vaccine (72,73).
REDUCED DOSAGE SCHEDULES OR MULTIPLE SMALL DOSES OF DTP
The ACIP recommends giving only full doses (0.5 mL) of DTP vaccine; if a specific contraindication
to DTP exists, the vaccine should not be given.
Concern about adverse events following pertussis vaccine has led some practitioners to reduce the
volume of DTP vaccine administered to <0.5mL/dose in an attempt to reduce side effects. No evidence
exists to show that this decreases the frequency of uncommon severe adverse events, such as seizures
and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes. Two studies have reported substantially lower rates of local
reactions with the use of one half the recommended dose (0.25mL) compared with a full dose (43,74 ).
However, a study among preterm infants showed that the incidence of side effects was unaltered when
a reduced dosage of DTP vaccine was used (75). Two studies also showed substantially lower
pertussis agglutinin responses after the second and third half-doses, although in one of the studies the
differences were small (74,75). These investigations used pertussis agglutinins as a measure of clinical
protection; however, agglutinins are not satisfactory measures of protection against pertussis disease.
Further, no evidence exists to show that the low screening dilution used (1:16) indicates protection.
Currently, no reliable measures of efficacy other than clinical protection exist. Other evidence against
the use of reduced doses comes from earlier studies of DTP vaccine preparations with potencies
equivalent to that of half-doses of current vaccine (76,77). The risk of pertussis for exposed household
members who received these lower potency vaccines was approximately twice as high as the risk of
pertussis for those who received vaccines as potent as full doses of current vaccine (29% compared
with <14%).
The use of an increased number of reduced-volume doses of DTP in order to equal the total volume
of the five recommended doses of DTP vaccine is not recommended. Whether this practice reduces the
likelihood of vaccine-related adverse events is unknown. In addition, the likelihood of a temporally
associated but etiologically unrelated event may be enhanced by increasing the number of vaccina-
tions.
SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF VACCINES
The simultaneous administration of DTP, oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), and measles-mumps-rubella
vaccine (MMR) has resulted in seroconversion rates and rates of side effects similar to those observed
when the vaccines are administered separately (78). Simultaneous vaccination with DTP, MMR, OPV,
or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HbCV) is also acceptable
(79). The ACIP recommends the simultaneous administration of all vaccines appropriate to the age
and previous vaccination status of the recipient, including the special circumstance of simultaneous
administration of DTP, OPV, HDCV, and MMR at >15 months of age.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
General Considerations
The decision to administer or delay DTP vaccination because of a current or recent febrile illness
depends largely on the severity of the symptoms and their etiology. Although a moderate or severe
10


## p. 11 (#39) ##############################################

febrile illness is sufficient reason to postpone vaccination, minor illnesses such as mild upper-
respiratory infections with or with-out low-grade fever are not contraindications. If ongoing medical
care cannot be assured, taking every opportunity to provide appropriate vaccinations is particularly
important
Children with moderate or severe illnesses with or without fever can receive DTP as soon as they
have recovered. Waiting a short period before administering DTP vaccine avoids superimposing the
adverse effects of the vaccination on the underlying illness or mistakenly attributing a manifestation of
the underlying illness to vaccination.
Routine physical examinations or temperature measurements are not prerequisites for vaccinating
infants and children who appear to be in good health. Appropriate immunization practice includes
asking the parent or guardian if the child is ill, postponing DTP vaccination for those with moderate or
severe acute illnesses, and vaccinating those without contraindications or precautionary circum-
stances.
When an infant or child returns for the next dose of DTP, the parent should always be questioned
about any adverse events that might have occurred following the previous dose.
A history of prematurity generally is not a reason to defer vaccination (75,80,81 ). Preterm infants
should be vaccinated according to their chronological age from birth.
Immunosuppressive therapies-including irradiation, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic
drugs, and corticosteroids (used in greater than physiologic doses) – may reduce the immune
response to vaccines. Short-term (<2-week) corticosteroid therapy or intra-articular, bursal, or tendon
injections with corticosteroids should not be immunosuppressive. Although no specific studies with
pertussis vaccine are available, if immunosuppressive therapy will be discontinued shortly, it is
reasonable to defer vaccination until the patient has been off therapy for 1 month; otherwise, the
patient should be vaccinated while still on therapy (82).
Special Considerations for Preparations Containing Pertussis Vaccine
Precautions and contraindications guidelines that were previously published regarding the use of
pertussis vaccine were based on three assumptions about the risks of pertussis vaccination that are not
supported by available data: a) that the vaccine on rare occasions caused acute encephalopathy
resulting in permanent brain damage; b) that pertussis vaccine aggravated preexisting central-
nervous-system disease; and c) that certain nonencephalitic reactions are predictive of more severe
reactions with subsequent doses (1). In addition, children from whom pertussis vaccine was withheld
were thought to be well protected by herd immunity, a belief that is no longer valid. The current revised
ACIP recommendations reflect better understanding of the risks associated not only with pertussis
vaccine but also with pertussis disease.
Contraindications
If any of the following events occur in temporal relationship to the administration of DTP, further
vaccination with DTP is contraindicated (see Table 4):
1. An immediate anaphylactic reaction. The rarity of such reactions to DTP is such that they have not
been adequately studied. Because of uncertainty as to which component of the vaccine might be
responsible, no further vaccination with any of the three antigens in DTP should be carried out.
Alternatively, because of the importance of tetanus vaccination, such individuals may be referred
for evaluation by an allergist and desensitized to tetanus toxoid if specific allergy can be
demonstrated (83,84).
2. Encephalopathy (not due to another identifiable cause). This is defined as an acute, severe
central-nervous-system disorder occurring within 7 days following vaccination, and generally

consisting of major alterations in consciousness, unresponsiveness, generalized or focal seizures
that persist more than a few hours, with failure to recover within 24 hours. Even though causation
by DTP cannot be established, no subsequent doses of pertussis vaccine should be given. It may
be desirable to delay for months before administering the balance of the doses of DT necessary
to complete the primary schedule. Such a delay allows time for the child's neurologic status to
clarify.
Precautions (Warnings)
If any of the following events occur in temporal relation to receipt of DTP, the decision to give
subsequent doses of vaccine containing the pertussis component should be carefully considered
(Table 4). Although these events were considered absolute contraindications in previous ACIP
recommendations, there may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, in which the
potential benefits outweigh possible risks, particularly because these events are not associated with
permanent sequelae (1). The following events were previously considered contraindications and are
now considered precautions:
1. Temperature of >40.5 C (105 F) within 48 hours not due to another identifiable cause. Such a
temperature is considered a precaution because of the likelihood that fever following a
subsequent dose of DTP vaccine also will be high. Because such febrile reactions are usually
attributed to the pertussis component, vaccination with DT should not be discontinued.
2. Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours. Although these
uncommon events have not been recognized to cause death nor to induce permanent neurolog-
ical sequelae, it is prudent to continue vaccination with DT, omitting the pertussis component
(40,85).
3. Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting >3 hours, occurring within 48 hours. Follow-up of infants
who have cried inconsolably following DTP vaccination has indicated that this reaction, though
unpleasant, is without long-term sequelae and not associated with other reactions of greater
significance (41 ). Inconsolable crying occurs most frequently following the first dose and is less
frequently reported following subsequent doses of DTP vaccine (42). However, crying for >30
minutes following DTP vaccination can be a predictor of increased likelihood of recurrence of
persistent crying following subsequent doses (41). Children with persistent crying have had a
higher rate of substantial local reactions than children who had other DTP-associated reactions
(including high fever, seizures, and hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes), suggesting that pro-
longed crying was really a pain reaction (85).
4. Convulsions with or without fever occurring within 3 days. Short-lived convulsions, with or
without fever, have not been shown to cause permanent sequelae (39,86 ). Furthermore, the
occurrence of prolonged febrile seizures (i.e., status epilepticus*), irrespective of their cause,
involving an otherwise normal child does not substantially increase the risk for subsequent
febrile (brief or prolonged) or afebrile seizures. The risk is significantly increased (p=0.018) only
among those children who are neurologically abnormal before their episode of status epilepticus
(87). Accordingly, although a convulsion following DTP vaccination has previously been
considered a contraindication to further doses, under certain circumstances subsequent doses
may be indicated, particularly if the risk of pertussis in the community is high. If a child has a
seizure following the first or second dose of DTP, it is desirable to delay subsequent doses until
the child's neurologic status is better defined. By the end of the first year of life, the presence of
an underlying neurologic disorder has usually been determined, and appropriate treatment
instituted. DT vaccine should not be administered before a decision has been made about
whether to restart the DTP series. Regardless of which vaccine is given, it is prudent also to
administer acetaminophen, 15 mg/kg of body weight, at the time of vaccination and every 4 hours
subsequently for 24 hours (88,89 ).
Vaccination of infants and young children who have underlying neurologic disorders
Infants and children with recognized, possible, or potential underlying neurologic conditions present
a unique problem. They seem to be at increased risk for the appearance of manifestations of the
underlying neurologic disorder within 2-3 days after vaccination. However, more prolonged manifes-
tations or increased progression of the disorder, or exacerbation of the disorder have not been
*Any seizure lasting >30 minutes or recurrent seizures lasting a total of 30 minutes without the child fully
regaining consciousness.
12


## p. 13 (#41) ##############################################

recognized (90). In addition, most neurologic conditions in infancy and young childhood are
associated with evolving, changing neurological findings. Functional abnormalities are often un-
masked by progressive neurologic development. Thus, confusion over the interpretation of progres-
sive neurologic signs may arise when DTP vaccination or any other therapeutic or preventive measure
is carried out.
Protection against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis is as important for children with neurologic
disabilities as for other children. Such protection may be even more important for neurologically
disabled children. They often receive custodial care or attend special schools where the risk of
pertussis is greater because DTP vaccination is avoided for fear of adverse reactions. Also, if
pertussis affects a neurologically disabled child who has difficulty in handling secretions and in
cooperating with symptomatic care, it may aggravate preexisting neurologic problems because of
anoxia, intracerebral hemorrhages, and other manifestations of the disease. Whether and when to
administer DTP to children with proven or suspected underlying neurologic disorders must be
decided on an individual basis. Important considerations include the current local incidence of
pertussis, the near absence of diphtheria in the United States, and the low risk of infection with
Clostridium tetani. On the basis of these considerations and the nature of the child's disorder, the
following approaches are recommended:
1. Infants and children with previous convulsions. Infants and young children who have had prior
seizures, whether febrile or afebrile, appear to be at increased risk for seizures following DTP
vaccination than children and infants without these histories (68 ). A convulsion within 3 days of
DTP vaccination in a child with a history of convulsions may be initiated by fever caused by the
vaccine in a child prone to febrile seizures, may be induced by the pertussis component, or may
be unrelated to the vaccination. As noted earlier, current evidence indicates that seizures
following DTP vaccination do not cause permanent brain damage. Among infants and children
with a history of previous seizures, it is prudent to delay DTP vaccination until the child's status
has been fully assessed, a treatment regimen established, and the condition stabilized. It should
be noted, however, that delaying DTP vaccination until the second 6 months of life will increase
the risk of febrile seizures among persons who are predisposed. When DTP or DT is given,
acetaminophen, 15 mg/kg, should also be given at the time of the vaccination and every 4 hours
for the ensuing 24 hours (88,89 ).
2. Infants as yet unvaccinated who are suspected of having underlying neurologic disease. It is
prudent to delay initiation of vaccination with DTP or DT (but not other vaccines) until further
observation and study have clarified the child's neurologic status and the effect of treatment. The
decision as to whether to begin vaccination with DTP or DT should be made no later than the
child's first birthday.
3. Children who have not received a complete series of vaccine and who have a neurologic event
occurring between doses. Infants and children who have received zone dose of DTP and who
experience a neurologic disorder (e.g., a seizure, for example) not temporally associated with
vaccination, but before the next scheduled dose, present a special management challenge. If the
seizure or other disorder occurs before the first birthday and before completion of the first three
doses of the primary series of DTP, further doses of DTP or DT (but not other vaccines) should be
deferred until the infant's status has been clarified. The decision whether to use DTP or DT to
complete the series should be made no later than the child's first birthday, and should take into
consideration the nature of the child's problem and the benefits and possible risks of the vaccine.
If the seizure or other disorder occurs after the first birthday, the child's neurologic status should
be evaluated to ensure that the disorder is stable before a subsequent dose of DTP is given. (See
the following #4.)
4. Infants and children with stable neurologic conditions. Infants and children with stable neuro-
logic conditions, including well-controlled seizures, may be vaccinated. The occurrence of single
seizures (temporally unassociated with DTP) do not contraindicate DTP vaccination, particularly
if the seizures can be satisfactorily explained. Parents of infants and children with histories of
convulsions should be informed of the increased risk of postvaccination seizures. Acetami-
nophen, 15 mg/kg, every 4 hours for 24 hours, should be given to children with such histories to
reduce the possibility of postvaccination fever (88,89).
13


## p. 14 (#42) ##############################################

5. Children with resolved or corrected neurologic disorders. DTP vaccination is recommended for
infants with certain neurologic problems, such as neonatal hypocalcemic tetany or hydroceph-
alus (following placement of a shunt and without seizures), that have been corrected or have
clearly subsided without residua.
Vaccination of infants and young children who have a family history of convulsion or other central
nervous system disorders
A family history of convulsions or other central nervous disorders is not a contraindication to
pertussis vaccination (2). Acetaminophen should be given at the time of DTP vaccination and every 4
hours for 24 hours to reduce the possibility of postvaccination fever (88,89).
Preparations Containing Diphtheria Toxoid and Tetanus Toxoid
The only contraindication to tetanus and diphtheria toxoids is a history of a neurologic or severe
hypersensitivity reaction following a previous dose. Vaccination with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids is
not known to be associated with an increased risk of convulsions. Local side effects alone do not
preclude continued use. If an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of tetanus toxoid is suspected,
intradermal skin testing with appropriately diluted tetanus toxoid may be useful before a decision is
made to discontinue tetanus toxoid vaccination (83). In one study, 94 of 95 persons with histories of
anaphylactic symptoms following a previous dose of tetanus toxoid were nonreactive following
intradermal testing and tolerated further tetanus toxoid challenge without incident (83). One person
had erythema and induration immediately following skin testing, but tolerated a full IM dose without
adverse effects. Mild, nonspecific skin-test reactivity to tetanus toxoid, particularly if used undiluted,
appears to be fairly common. Most vaccinees develop inconsequential cutaneous delayed hypersen-
sitivity to the toxoid.
Persons who experienced Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions or a temperature of >103 F (39.4 C)
following a prior dose of tetanus toxoid usually have high serum tetanus antitoxin levels and should
not be given even emergency doses of Td more frequently than every 10 years, even if they have a
wound that is neither clean nor minor.
If a contraindication to using tetanus toxoid-containing preparations exists for a person who has not
completed a primary series of tetanus toxoid immunization and that person has a wound that is neither
clean nor minor, only passive immunization should be given using tetanus immune globulin (TIG).
(See Tetanus Prophylaxis in Wound Management).
Although no evidence exists that tetanus and diphtheria toxoids are teratogenic, waiting until the
second trimester of pregnancy to administer Td is a reasonable precaution for minimizing any concern
about the theoretical possibility of such reactions.
Misconceptions Concerning Contraindications to DTP
Some health-care providers inappropriately consider certain conditions or circumstances as
contraindications to DTP vaccination. These include the following:
1. Soreness, redness, or swelling at the DTP vaccination site or temperature of <40.5C(105 F).
2. Mild, acute illness with low-grade fever or mild diarrheal illness affecting an otherwise healthy
child.
3. Current antimicrobial therapy or the convalescent phase of an acute illness.
4. Recent exposure to an infectious disease.
5. Prematurity. The appropriate age for initiating vaccination among the prematurely born infant is
the usual chronological age from birth (75,80,81 ). Full doses (0.5 mL) of vaccine should be used.
6. History of allergies or relatives with allergies.
7. Family history of convulsions.
8. Family history of SIDS.
9. Family history of an adverse event following DTP vaccination.
PREVENTION OF DIPHTHERIA AMONG CONTACTS OF A DIPHTHERIA PATIENT
Identification of Close Contacts
The primary purpose of contact investigation is to prevent secondary transmission of C. diphtheriae
and the occurrence of additional diphtheria cases. Only close contacts of a patient with culture-
14


## p. 15 (#43) ##############################################

confirmed or suspected* diphtheria should be considered at increased risk for acquiring secondary
disease. Such contacts include all household members and other persons with a history of habitual,
close contact with the patient, as well as those directly exposed to oral secretions of the patient.
Identification of close contacts of a diphtheria patient should be promptly initiated.
Cultures and Antimicrobial Prophylaxis
All close contacts (regardless of their vaccination status) should have samples taken for culture,
receive prompt antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis, and be examined daily for 7 days for evidence of
disease. Awaiting culture results before administering antimicrobial prophylaxis to close contacts is
not warranted. The identification of carriers among close contacts may support the diagnosis of
diphtheria for a patient whose cultures are negative either because of prior antimicrobial therapy or
because of other reasons. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should consist of either an IM injection of
benzathine penicillin (600,000 units for persons <6 years old and 1,200,000 units for those > 6 years
old) or a 7- to 10-day course of oral erythromycin (children: 40 mg/kg/day; adults: 1 g/day).
Erythromycin may be slightly more effective, but IM benzathine penicillin may be preferred, because
it avoids possible noncompliance with a multi-day oral drug regimen. The efficacy of antimicrobial
prophylaxis in preventing secondary disease is presumed but not proven. Identified carriers of C.
diphtheriae should have follow-up cultures done after they complete antimicrobial therapy. Those who
continue to harbor the organism after either penicillin or erythromycin should receive an additional
10-day course of oral erythromycin and follow-up cultures.
Immunization
Active
All household and other close contacts who have received <three doses of diphtheria toxoid or
whose vaccination status is unknown should receive an immediate dose of a diphtheria toxoid-
containing preparation and should complete the primary series according to schedule (Tables 1 and 2).
Close contacts who have completed a primary series of >three doses and who have not been
vaccinated with diphtheria toxoid within the previous 5 years should receive a booster dose of a
diphtheria toxoid-containing preparation appropriate for their age.
Passive
The only preparation available for passive immunization against diphtheria is equine diphtheria
antitoxin. Even when close surveillance of unvaccinated close contacts is impossible, use of this
preparation is not generally recommended because of the risks of allergic reaction to horse serum.
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur among approximately 7%, and serum sickness among 5%
of adults receiving the recommended prophylactic dose of equine antitoxin. The risk of an adverse
reaction to equine antitoxin must be weighed against the small risk that an unvaccinated household
contact who receives chemoprophylaxis will contract diphtheria. No evidence exists to support any
additional benefit of diphtheria antitoxin use for contacts who have received antimicrobial prophylaxis.
If antitoxin is to be used, 5,000-10,000 units IM-after appropriate testing for sensitivity-at a site
different from that of the toxoid injection is the dosage usually recommended. Diphtheria antitoxin is
unlikely to impair the immune response to simultaneous administration of diphtheria toxoid, but this
has not been adequately studied.
A serum specimen collected from a patient with suspected diphtheria (before antitoxin therapy is
initiated) may be helpful in supporting the diagnosis of diphtheria if a level of diphtheria antitoxin
below that considered to be protective (i.e., <0.01 IU/mL) can be demonstrated. Such testing may be
particularly helpful with a patient for whom antimicrobial therapy had been initiated prior to obtaining
diphtheria cultures.
Cutaneous Diphtheria
Cases of cutaneous diphtheria generally are caused by infections with nontoxigenic strains of C.
diphtheriae. If a toxigenic C. diphtheriae strain is isolated from a cutaneous lesion, investigation and
*For example, a patient for whom the decision has been made to treat with diphtheria antitoxin. Antitoxin can be
obtained either from a manufacturer (Connaught Labs, Inc., or Sclavo, Inc.) or the Division of Immunization, CDC
(telephone: 404-639-2888).
15


## p. 16 (#44) ##############################################

prophylaxis of close contacts should be undertaken, as with respiratory diphtheria. If a cutaneous case
is known to be due to a nontoxigenic strain, routine investigation or prophylaxis of contacts is not
necessary.
TETANUS PROPHYLAXIS IN WOUND MANAGEMENT
Chemoprophylaxis against tetanus is neither practical nor useful in managing wounds. Wound
cleaning, debridement when indicated, and proper immunization are important. The need for tetanus
toxoid (active immunization), with or without TIG (passive immunization), depends on both the
condition of the wound and the patient's vaccination history (Table 5; see also Precautions and
Contraindications). Rarely has tetanus occurred among persons with documentation of having
received a primary series of toxoid injections.
A thorough attempt must be made to determine whether a patient has completed primary
vaccination. Patients with unknown or uncertain previous vaccination histories should be considered
to have had no previous tetanus toxoid doses. Persons who had military service since 1941 can be
considered to have received at least one dose. Although most people in the military since 1941 may
have completed a primary series of tetanus toxoid, this cannot be assumed for each individual.
Patients who have not completed a primary series may require tetanus toxoid and passive immuni-
zation at the time of wound cleaning and debridement (Table 5).
Available evidence indicates that complete primary vaccination with tetanus toxoid provides
long-lasting protection 10 years for most recipients. Consequently, after complete primary tetanus
vaccination, boosters-even for wound management-need be given only every 10 years when wounds
are minor and uncontaminated. For other wounds, a booster is appropriate if the patient has not
received tetanus toxoid within the preceding 5 years. Persons who have received at least two doses of
tetanus toxoid rapidly develop antitoxin antibodies.
Td is the preferred preparation for active tetanus immunization in wound management of patients
>7 years of age. Because a large proportion of adults are susceptible, this plan enhances diphtheria
protection. Thus, by taking advantage of acute health-care visits, such as for wound management,
some patients can be protected who otherwise would remain susceptible. For routine wound
management among children <7 years of age who are not adequately vaccinated, DTP should be used
instead of single-antigen tetanus toxoid. DT may be used if pertussis vaccine is contraindicated or
individual circumstances are such that potential febrile reactions following DTP might confound the
management of the patient. For inadequately vaccinated patients of all ages, completion of primary
vaccination at the time of discharge or at follow-up visits should be ensured (Tables 1 and 2).
If passive immunization is needed, human TIG is the product of choice. It provides protection longer
than antitoxin of animal origin and causes few adverse reactions. The TIG prophylactic dose that is

currently recommended for wounds of average severity is 250 units IM. When tetanus toxoid and TIG
are given concurrently, separate syringes and separate sites should be used. The ACIP recommends
the use of only adsorbed toxoid in this situation.
PROPHYLAXIS FOR CONTACTS OF PERTUSSIS PATIENTS
Spread of pertussis can be limited by decreasing the infectivity of the patient and by protecting close
contacts. To reduce infectivity as quickly as possible, a course of oral erythromycin (children: 40
mg/kg/day; adults: 1g/day) or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (children: trimethoprim 8 mg/kg/day,
sulfamethoxazole 40 mg/kg/day; adults: trimethoprim 320mg/day, sulfamethoxazole 1,600mg/day) is
recommended for patients with clinical pertussis. Antimicrobial therapy should be continued for 14
days to minimize any chance of treatment failure. It is generally accepted that symptoms may be
ameliorated when effective therapy is initiated during the catarrhal stage of disease (91). Some
evidence suggests erythromycin therapy can alter the clinical course of pertussis when initiated early
in the paroxysmal stage (19,92,93).
Erythromycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis should be administered for 14 days to
all household and other close contacts of persons with pertussis, regardless of age and vaccination
status. Although data from controlled clinical trials are lacking, prophylaxis of all household members
and other close contacts may prevent or minimize transmission (92,94-96). All close contacts <7 years
of age who have not completed the four-dose primary series should complete the series with the
minimal intervals (Table 1). Those who have completed a primary series but have not received a dose
of DTP vaccine within 3 years of exposure should be given a booster dose.
Prophylactic postexposure passive immunization is not recommended. The use of human pertussis
immune globulin neither prevents illness nor reduces its severity. This product is no longer available
in the United States.

Pertussis Vaccination:
Acellular Pertussis Vaccine for
Reinforcing and Booster Use -
Supplementary ACIP Statement
Recommendations of the Immunization Practices
Advisory Committee (ACIP)
This supplementary statement provides information on and recommendations for the use of
diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP). One such vaccine was
recently licensed, ACEL-IMUNE.* This vaccine is licensed for use only as the fourth and fifth
doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccination; it is not licensed for the initial
three-dose series in infants and children, regardless of age. At least one other DTP product is
anticipated to be licensed in the future for use as the fourth and fifth doses. The current
Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) statement on diphtheria, tetanus, and
pertussis issued August 8, 1991, gives general recommendations on pertussis prevention,
including the use of whole-cell pertussis vaccines for primary and booster vaccination (1).
INTRODUCTION
Current Whole-Cell Pertussis Vaccines
Simultaneous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis during infancy and childhood
has been a routine practice in the United States since the late 1940s. Whole-cell pertussis vaccines in
the United States have been and continue to be prepared from suspensions of inactivated or disrupted
Bordetella pertussis whole bacterial cells. Routine vaccination with whole-cell pertussis vaccines has
been highly effective in reducing the burden of disease and deaths due to pertussis (3). Although the
efficacy of each whole-cell vaccine in use in the United States has not been precisely estimated, clear
evidence of overall high efficacy is available (4,5).
Whole-cell pertussis vaccines, although safe, are associated with a variety of adverse events,
particularly local erythema, swelling and tenderness, fever, and other mild systemic events such as
drowsiness, fretfulness, and anorexia (6,7). Infrequently, febrile convulsions and hypotonic-
hyporesponsive episodes can occur after whole-cell DTP vaccination (6). The general concerns about
safety have led investigators to attempt to develop safer pertussis vaccines that have high efficacy.
Acellular Pertussis Vaccines
General Information
Efforts have been under way for >20 years to identify and purify the antigens of B. pertussis that can
be incorporated into acellular pertussis vaccines that are protective, yet are less likely to induce
reactions. In Japan, the initial impetus for the accelerated development of acellular pertussis vaccines
was the occurrence in 1975 of two deaths in infants within 24 hours of DTP vaccination (8,9). These
events led health authorities to temporarily suspend the routine use of whole-cell DTP vaccine in
infants (then initiated at 3 months of age). Routine whole-cell DTP vaccination was rapidly reintroduced
in most areas but recommended for administration at age >2 years. However, vaccination coverage of
children decreased, and the incidence of reported pertussis increased markedly, reaching a peak in
1979. Meanwhile, efforts to purify antigens of B. pertussis were accelerated. After limited clinical
studies of immunogenicity and safety, several DTP vaccines were licensed in Japan in 1981.
Since 1981, methods of purifying the antigenic components of B. pertussis have continued to
improve, additional information on the protection of various antigens in animal models has accumu-
lated, and candidate vaccines have been developed by many multinational manufacturers. Current
* Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed is prepared and distributed as
ACEL-IMUNEⓇ by Lederle Laboratories (Pearl River, New York) and was licensed December 17, 1991 (2). The
acellular pertussis vaccine component is produced by Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), and is
combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids manufactured by Lederle Laboratories.

candidate vaccines contain one or more of the bacterial components thought to provide protection.
These components include filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), pertussis toxin (PT- also known as
lymphocytosis promoting-factor, which is inactivated to a toxoid when included in a vaccine), a
recently identified 69-kilodalton outer-membrane protein (pertactin; Pn), and agglutinogens of at least
two types (fimbriae [Fim) types 2 and 3). Several studies, relating to the immunogenicity and the safety
of various candidate acellular pertussis vaccines, are currently being conducted or have been
completed among children in the United States and other countries. In general, these vaccines, which
are immunogenic, are less likely to cause common adverse reactions than the current whole-cell
preparations (10-19).
The efficacy of two acellular pertussis vaccines developed by the Japanese National Institute of
Health (NIH) was studied during the period 1985 through 1987 in a randomized, placebo-controlled
clinical trial in Sweden, a country in which pertussis vaccine had not been used routinely since 1979
(20). One vaccine (known in the trial as JNIH-6) contained 23.4 mg/dose each of pertussis toxoid and
FHA. Another vaccine (JNIH-7), not similar to any vaccine used in Japan, contained only 37.7 ug/dose
of pertussis toxoid. The 3,801 children who participated in this trial were randomly selected to receive
two doses of an acellular pertussis vaccine (approximately 1,420 children in each vaccine group) or a
placebo (954 children). Neither of the vaccines nor the placebo contained diphtheria and tetanus
toxoids. The first dose of vaccine or placebo was administered to children 5-11 months of age; the
second dose was administered 8-12 weeks later. Each vaccine demonstrated some degree of efficacy.
For culture-confirmed disease with cough of any duration, the observed efficacy was 69% for JNIH-6
(95% confidence interval [CI], 47%-82%) and 54% for JNIH-7 (95% CI, 26%-72%) (20). Levels of
estimated efficacy were higher against culture-confirmed pertussis that was more severe and classic.
The efficacy of JNIH-6 was 79% (95% CI, 57%-90%) and that of JNIH-7 was 80% (95% CI, 59%-91%)
against culture-confirmed pertussis with cough lasting more than 30 days. However, direct compari-
sons with whole-cell pertussis vaccine were not available to determine whether one or both of these
acellular vaccines conferred protection at least equivalent to that of whole-cell vaccine. This trial also
demonstrated that the complexities of evaluating pertussis vaccine efficacy had changed substantially
depending upon the case definition used (21-23). Specific serologic correlates of immunity were not
identified in this study. It remains undetermined which vaccine components are most effective in
inducing protection and which types of immune responses are most responsible for protection. During
the trial, four participants died of invasive bacterial disease that occurred up to 5 months after
vaccination. Three had received the JNIH-6 vaccine and one had received JNIH-7 vaccine; the
significance of these findings is uncertain (24). Primarily because of concerns regarding the level of
efficacy of the vaccine following vaccination, neither vaccine is licensed for use in Sweden (25).
Until now, acellular pertussis vaccines have been licensed for use only in Japan, where, since 1981,
such vaccines have been administered routinely to children >2 years of age (9). Studies of persons
exposed to pertussis in household settings have demonstrated the effectiveness of several acellular
pertussis vaccines manufactured in Japan in preventing clinical pertussis among children >2 years of
age (8,26-28). In Japan, with the continued use of acellular pertussis vaccines, the incidence of disease
and death caused by pertussis has declined steadily. However, the reported incidence among children
age <2 years has remained higher than the incidence among children of that age when whole-cell
vaccines were routinely used in infants (9). Since 1989, vaccination of infants with DTap beginning at
3 months of age has been initiated in many areas of Japan at the recommendation of the Ministry of
Health. However, the extent of use among children <2 years of age remains low (S. Isomura, personal
communication, 1991). Therefore, it is too soon to make conclusions about the effect of this policy on
the age-specific incidence of pertussis among children <2 years of age.
Based on the experiences in Sweden and Japan, questions remain whether acellular pertussis
vaccines confer clinical protection when administered early in infancy, or whether protection induced
at any age is equivalent to that of whole-cell pertussis vaccine preparations. Consistent with the
licensure of DTP, the Committee recommends that whole-cell pertussis vaccine be continued for the
initial three-dose vaccination series until an alternative vaccine is available that has demonstrated
essentially equivalent or higher efficacy. To evaluate the relative protective efficacy of primary
vaccination among infants, several clinical trials, which will compare DTP vaccine with whole-cell DTP
vaccine, are in progress or development.

ACEL-IMUNEⓇ Information
On December 17, 1991, the FDA licensed one DTP vaccine for use as the fourth and fifth doses of
the recommended DTP series. ACEL-IMUNE® contains 40 mcg of protein; approximately 86% of this
protein is FHA; 8%, PT; 4%, Pn; and 2%, Fim type 2. The acellular pertussis vaccine component is
purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation; PT is
detoxified by treatment with formaldehyde. Each dose of ACEL-IMUNE® contains 7.5 limit of
flocculation (Lf) of diphtheria toxoid, 5.0 Lf of tetanus toxoid, and 300 hemagglutinating (HA) units of
acellular pertussis vaccine. The FHA and PT components both exhibit HA activity. The combined
components are adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide and aluminum phosphate and preserved with
1:10,000 thimerosal.
Household exposure studies have demonstrated efficacy of acellular pertussis vaccines among
children in Japan vaccinated at age >2 years with the Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine component,
combined with Takeda-produced diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (27-29). Clinical studies are in
progress to examine the relative efficacy of ACEL-IMUNEⓇ in preventing disease when administered to
infants at ages 2, 4, and 6 months compared with whole-cell DTP vaccine. The following evidence
supports the use of ACEL-IMUNEⓇ after the initial infant three-dose series of whole-cell DTP vaccine.
Immunogenicity. When ACEL-IMUNEⓇ is used for the fourth and fifth doses of the vaccination
series, antibody responses after administration are generally similar to those following whole-cell DTP
vaccine for the PT, Pn, and Fim components; antibody responses are higher for FHA (Table 1) (17,18).
Clinical efficacy. In Japan, Takeda-manufactured DTP vaccine has been shown to prevent
pertussis disease among children age >2 years, however, in this retrospective study clinicians and
investigators were not blinded to the vaccination status of the participants (28). The occurrence of
pertussis was compared in 62 children vaccinated with two to four doses of Takeda DTap on or after
the second birthday and 62 unvaccinated children for the period 7-30 days after household exposure
to pertussis. Typical clinical pertussis occurred in one vaccinated child and 43 unvaccinated children;
estimated clinical vaccine efficacy: 98% (95% CI, 84%-99%). Minor respiratory illness-possibly
representing mild, atypical pertussis-occurred among an additional eight vaccinated and four
unvaccinated children. When these children were included, the estimated vaccine efficacy was 81%
(95% CI, 64%-90%). None of the vaccinated household contacts in this study were age <2 years; by
restricting the analysis of results to household contacts who were age >2 years, the corresponding
estimates of efficacy were 97% (95% CI, 82%-99%) and 79% (95% CI, 60%-89%) respectively. In a
smaller study of similar design, results were similar (29).
Safety. Local reactions, fever, and other common systemic events occur less frequently after
receipt of ACEL-IMUNE® vaccinations than after whole-cell DTP vaccination. In general, local and
common systemic events occur approximately one-fourth to two-thirds the frequency after whole-cell
DTP vaccination (Table 2) (17,18). Available data indicate comparable safety for ACEL-IMUNE® and
Takeda DTP packaged in Japan.

VACCINE USAGE
See the general ACIP statement on diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis for more details (1). This
vaccine is licensed only for use as the fourth and fifth doses of the DTP series among children ages 15
months through 6 years of age (before the seventh birthday). Use of DTP is not recommended for
children who have received less than three doses of whole-cell DTP, regardless of age. The Committee
considers the first four DTP doses as primary immunization against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis.
The fourth (reinforcing) dose of DTP, generally given at age 15-18 months, is administered to maintain
adequate pertussis immunity during the preschool years. The fifth (booster) dose of DTP is adminis-
tered at ages 4-6 years of age to confer continued protection against exposure during the early years
of school.
Either whole-cell DTP or DTP can be used interchangeably for the fourth and fifth doses of the
routine series of vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis among children > 15 months of
age. The Committee recommends the use of DTP, if readily available, because it substantially reduces
local reactions, fever, and other common systemic events that often follow receipt of whole-cell DTP.
The standard, single-dose volume of ACEL-IMUNE® is 0.5 mL and should be administered
intramuscularly (IM).
Indications for the Fourth (Reinforcing) Dose
Six to 12 months after the third dose of DTP
One dose of DTP (instead of whole-cell DTP) can be administered IM to children age 15-18 months
(or later when necessary); this dose should be administered at least 6 months after the third dose of
whole-cell DTP (Table 3). The fourth dose of either DTP or DTP is an integral part of the primary
immunizing course of pertussis vaccination. DTP is not licensed for use among children age <15
months. Although immunogenicity data among children age 15-16 months are not yet available for
ACEL-IMUNE®, the Committee suggests that ACEL-IMUNE® be used for children as part of the
recommended schedule of routine simultaneous vaccination with DTP, oral poliovirus (OPV), and
measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) at age 15-18 months (30 ).
Booster Vaccination
Children 4-6 years of age (up to the seventh birthday)
A dose of DTP can be administered as the fifth dose in the series for children ages 4-6 years who
either have received all four prior doses as whole-cell vaccine or for those children who have received

three doses of whole-cell DTP and one dose of DTP. A fifth dose of either DTAP or DTP should be
administered before the child enters kindergarten or elementary school. The Committee recommends
the use of DTap, if readily available. This fifth dose is not necessary if the fourth dose in the series is
given on or after the fourth birthday.
Special Considerations
Vaccination of infants and young children who have a personal or family history of seizures
Recent data suggest that infants and young children who have had previous seizures (whether
febrile or nonfebrile) or who have immediate family members with such histories are at increased risk
of seizures following DTP vaccination than those without such histories (1). Because these reactions
may be due to the fever induced by whole-cell DTP vaccine and because DTap is infrequently
associated with moderate to high fever, use of DTP is strongly recommended for the fourth and fifth
doses if pertussis vaccination is considered for these children (see Precautions and Contraindications).
A family history of seizures or other central nervous disorders does not justify withholding pertussis
vaccination. Acetaminophen should be given at the time of DTP or DTP vaccination and every 4 hours
for 24 hours to reduce the possibility of postvaccination fever in these children.
Children with a contraindication to pertussis vaccination (see Precautions and Contraindications)
For children younger than age 7 years who have a contraindication to whole-cell pertussis vaccine,
DT should be used instead of DTP; DTP should not be substituted. If additional doses of pertussis
vaccine become contraindicated after a DTP series is begun in the first year of life, DT should be
substituted for each remaining scheduled DTP dose.
Pertussis vaccination for persons age >7 years
Adolescents and adults who have waning immunity are a major reservoir for transmission of
pertussis (31). It is possible that booster doses of other preparations of acellular pertussis vaccines will
be recommended in the future for persons age 7 years, although it is not currently recommended.
SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS
For a complete discussion, see the general ACIP statement on diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (1).
Although mild systemic reactions such as fever, drowsiness, fretfulness, and anorexia occur
frequently after both whole-cell DTP vaccination and ACEL-IMUNE“ vaccination, they are less common
after ACEL-IMUNEⓇ vaccination (Table 2). These reactions are self-limited and can be safely managed
with symptomatic treatment.
Moderate-to-severe systemic events, including fever 40.5 C (105 F); persistent, inconsolable crying
lasting 3 hours or more; and collapse (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) have been rarely reported

after vaccination with DTP (16,20,32 ). Each of these events appears to occur less often than with
whole-cell DTP. When these events occur after the administration of whole-cell DTP, they appear to be
without sequelae; the limited experience with DTP suggests a similar outcome.
In U.S. studies, more severe neurologic events, such as prolonged convulsions or encephalopathy,
have not been reported in temporal association after administration of approximately 6,500 doses of
ACEL-IMUNE®. This somewhat limited experience does not allow conclusions to be drawn whether any
rare serious adverse events will occur after administration of DTaP. Because DTap causes fever less
frequently than whole-cell DTP, it is anticipated that events such as febrile convulsions will be less
common after receiving DTaP.
SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF VACCINES
The simultaneous administration of DTP, OPV, and MMR has not been evaluated. However, on the
basis of studies using whole-cell DTP, the Committee does not anticipate any differences in
seroconversion rates and rates of side effects from those observed when the vaccines are administered
separately. Although combinations have not been thoroughly studied, simultaneous vaccination with
DTP, MMR, OPV, or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HbCV)
is acceptable; similarly, simultaneous vaccination with DTP, hepatitis B vaccine (HBV), OPV, IPV, and
HbCV is also acceptable. The Committee recommends the simultaneous administration of all vaccines
appropriate to the age and the previous vaccination status of the child (30), including the special
circumstance of simultaneous administration of DTP or DTP, OPV, HbCV, and MMR at age >15
months.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
General Considerations
DTP is licensed only for reinforcing and booster immunization, the fourth and fifth doses in the
DTP series. DTap is not licensed for use among children age <15 months, on or after the seventh
birthday, or for the initial three-dose series among infants and children regardless of their age.
Contraindications
Because no data currently exist to suggest otherwise, contraindications to further doses of DTP are
the same as those for the whole-cell DTP. If any of the following events occurs in temporal relation with
the administration of DTP or DTaP; subsequent vaccination with DTP or DTP is contraindicated:
1. An immediate anaphylactic reaction.
2. Encephalopathy (not due to another identifiable cause), defined as an acute, severe central
nervous system disorder occurring within 7 days after vaccination and generally consisting of
major alterations in consciousness, unresponsiveness, or generalized or focal seizures that
persist more than a few hours, without recovery within 24 hours.
Precautions (Warnings)
If any of the following events occurs in temporal relation with the receipt of either whole-cell DTP or
DTP, the decision to administer subsequent doses of vaccine containing the pertussis component
should be carefully considered. Although these events were once considered absolute contraindica-
tions to whole-cell DTP, there may be circumstances, such as a high incidence of pertussis, in which
the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks, particularly since the following events have not been
proven to cause permanent sequelae:
1. Temperature of 240.5 C (105 F) within 48 hours, not due to another identifiable cause.
2. Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode) within 48 hours.
3. Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting >3 hours, occurring within 48 hours.
4. Convulsions with or without fever, occurring within 3 days.
6


## p. 7 (#61) ###############################################

If these events occur after receipt of any of the first four doses of whole-cell DTP vaccine and if
additional doses of pertussis vaccine are indicated because the potential benefits outweigh the
potential risks, consideration should be given to the use of DTap for the fourth and fifth doses.
REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS AFTER VACCINATION
As with any newly licensed vaccine, surveillance for information regarding the safety of DTP in
large-scale use is important. Surveillance information aids in the assessment of vaccine safety,
although its usefulness is limited, by identifying potential events that may warrant further study.
Additionally, specific evaluations of DTP use in larger populations than those studied for license
application are being initiated.
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) of the Department of Health and Human
Services became operational in November, 1990. VAERS is designed to accept reports of all serious
adverse events that occur after receipt of DTP, as well as any other vaccine, including but not limited
to those mandated by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (33). Any questions about
reporting requirements, completion of the report form, or requests for reporting forms can be directed
to 1-800-822-7967.

Pertussis Vaccination:
Acellular Pertussis Vaccine for the
Fourth and Fifth Doses of the DTP Series
Update to Supplementary ACIP Statement
Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP)
Summary
General recommendations on pertussis prevention were issued August 8,
1991, in the ACIP statement on diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (1). A
supplementary statement on the use of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and
acellular pertussis vaccine (DTP) was issued February 7, 1992 (2) after the
licensure of ACEL-IMUNE®, prepared by Lederle Laboratories. With the recent
licensure of a second DTP product,* Tripediaw, this statement updates the
supplement. Tripedia has a formulation that differs from that of ACEL-
IMUNE®. Both DTP vaccines are licensed for use only as the fourth and/or fifth
doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccination; they are not licensed for
the initial three-dose series for infants and children, regardless of age. Whole-
cell DTP should continue to be used for the initial three-dose series and remains
an acceptable alternative for the fourth and fifth doses. For details on the
background, indications, use, and precautions and contraindications of DTP,
refer to the earlier supplementary statement (2).
INTRODUCTION
Simultaneous vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis during infancy
and childhood has been a recommended routine practice in the United States since
the late 1940s. Whole-cell pertussis vaccines in the United States have been and
continue to be prepared from suspensions of killed Bordetella pertussis whole
bacterial cells. Routine vaccination with whole-cell vaccines has been highly effective
in reducing the burden of disease and deaths due to pertussis (3). Whole-cell
pertussis vaccines, although safe, are associated with a variety of expected adverse
events; these concerns have led to attempts to develop safer pertussis vaccines that
have high efficacy.
Several antigenic components of Bordetella pertussis have been identified.
Candidate acellular pertussis vaccines, produced by multinational manufacturers, are
now available due to advances in the methods of purifying and preparing these
components. In general, these vaccines are immunogenic and are less likely to cause
* Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed, prepared and
distributed as Tripedia® by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania), was
licensed August 21, 1992. The purified acellular pertussis vaccine component is produced by
BIKEN/Tanabe Corporation (Osaka, Japan), and is combined with diphtheria and tetanus
toxoids manufactured by Connaught Laboratories.

common adverse reactions than the current whole-cell preparations. Several clinical
trials, which compare relative protective efficacy of primary vaccination utilizing
diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTP) vaccines with that of
whole-cell vaccines administered to infants, are in progress or development. A lack of
adequate evidence, until recently, to demonstrate the effectiveness of any single
preparation has delayed U.S. licensure for any indication of a candidate acellular
pertussis vaccine. On December 17, 1991, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
licensed the DTP vaccine ACEL-IMUNE® for use as the fourth and/or fifth doses of the
recommended DTP series. The FDA has now licensed a second DTP vaccine,
Tripedia
Tripedia Information
On August 21, 1992, the FDA licensed Tripedia for use as the fourth and/or fifth
doses of the recommended DTP series. The acellular pertussis vaccine components
are purified from Bordetella pertussis by salt precipitation, ultracentrifugation, and
ultrafiltration. After purification, filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertussis toxin
(PT) are combined to obtain a 1:1 ratio and are then treated with formaldehyde to
inactivate PT. Each dose of Tripedia® contains 23.4 mcg protein of FHA and 23.4 mcg
protein of inactivated PT (toxoid), as well as 6.7 Lf of diphtheria toxoid and 5.0 Lf of
tetanus toxoid. The combined components are adsorbed to aluminum potassium
sulfate and preserved with 1:10,000 thimerosal.
Household exposure and ecologic studies among Japanese children vaccinated at
>2 years of age, have suggested efficacy of the BIKEN and other acellular pertussis
vaccines when combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids as DTP (4–7). In
addition, a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical efficacy trial in Sweden during the
period 1985–1987 demonstrated efficacy when two doses of a BIKEN pertussis
vaccine – similar to the formulation in Tripedia- were given to children starting at
ages 5–11 months old, an age older than that recommended for initiating whole-cell
DTP vaccination in the United States (1,8). However, the experiences in Sweden and
Japan do not satisfactorily define whether acellular pertussis vaccines confer clinical
protection when administered early in infancy (i.e., 2, 4, and 6 months of age) and
whether protection induced at any age is equivalent to that of whole-cell pertussis
vaccine preparations.
The following evidence supports the use of Tripedia® after the initial three-dose
series of whole-cell DTP vaccine in infants:
Immunogenicity
Antibody responses to PT and FHA following administration of Tripediam as the
fourth and fifth doses of the vaccination series are similar to or higher than those
following whole-cell DTP vaccine (Table 1). Data are available to demonstrate the
immunogenicity of Tripedias among children ages 15–16 months. The standard,
single-dose volume of Tripedia is 0.5 mL and should be administered intramuscu-
larly (IM).
Clinical efficacy
The efficacy of two acellular pertussis vaccines developed by the Japan National
Institute of Health (JNIH) and prepared by BIKEN was studied in 1985–1987 in a
randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in Sweden (2,8). One of the vaccines

The first dose of vaccine or placebo was administered at 5–11 months of age; the
second dose was administered 8–12 weeks later. For culture-confirmed disease with
cough of any duration, the observed efficacy for JNIH-6 was 69% (95% confidence
interval (CI), 47% 82%); for culture-confirmed pertussis with cough lasting >30 days,
the observed efficacy was 79% (95% CI, 57%-90%) (8). Non-blinded follow-up studies
conducted over a 42-month interval after the trial had ended support the efficacy
estimates obtained from the clinical trial (9).
Safety
Local reactions, fever, and other common systemic symptoms occur less fre-
quently after receipt of Tripedia vaccine than after whole-cell DTP vaccine. In
general, the frequency of local and common systemic events is approximately
one-fifth to one-half the frequency of these events after whole-cell DTP vaccination
(Table 2).
VACCINE USAGE

the fourth and fifth doses of the routine series of vaccination against diphtheria,
tetanus, and pertussis among children >15 months of age. The ACIP Committee
recommends the use of DTap, if readily available, because it substantially reduces
local reactions, fever, and other common systemic events that often follow receipt of
whole-cell DTP. There are no specific data to support the use of one particular DTap
vaccine product over the other. No data exist regarding the intermixed use of the two
DTP products at the fourth and fifth doses of the series with respect to safety,
immunogenicity, or efficacy.
Tripedia can be administered to children as part of the recommended schedule
of routine simultaneous vaccination with DTP; oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV); mea-
sles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR); and, when appropriate, Haemophilus b
conjugate vaccine (HDCV) at 15–18 months of age (9).
SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS
For a complete discussion, see the general ACIP statement on diphtheria, tetanus,
and pertussis and the supplementary statement on DTap (1,2). Refer to the earlier
supplementary statement for details on the precautions and contraindications to
DTap use (2)
Although mild systemic reactions such as fever, drowsiness, fretfulness, and
anorexia occur frequently after both whole-cell DTP vaccination and Tripedia

vaccination, they are less common after Tripedia (Table 2). These reactions are
self-limited and can be safely managed with symptomatic treatment.
Moderate-to-severe systemic events, including fever 40.5 C (105 F); persistent,
inconsolable crying lasting >3 hours; and collapse (hypotonic-hyporesponsive epi-
sode) have rarely been reported after vaccination with DTP (8,10–12). Each of these
events appears to occur less often than with whole-cell DTP. When these events occur
after the administration of whole-cell DTP, they appear to be without sequelae; the
limited.experience with DTP suggests a similar outcome.
Other more severe neurologic events, such as prolonged convulsions or enceph-
alopathy, have not been reported in temporal association after administration of
approximately 11,000 doses of Tripedia® in U.S. studies. This limited experience
does not allow conclusions to be drawn as to whether any rare serious adverse events
will occur after administration of DTP. Because DTP causes fever less frequently
than whole-cell DTP, it is anticipated that events such as febrile convulsions will be

Recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
Mumps Prevention
This revised Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommendation on mumps
vaccine updates the 1982 recommendation (1). Changes include: a discussion of the evolving
epidemiologic characteristics of mumps, introduction of a cutoff of 1957 as the oldest birth cohort for
which mumps vaccination is routinely recommended, and more aggressive outbreak-control mea-
sures. Although there are no major changes in vaccination strategy, these revised recommendations
place a greater emphasis on vaccinating susceptible adolescents and young adults.
INTRODUCTION
Mumps Disease
Mumps disease is generally self-limited, but it may be moderately debilitating. Naturally acquired
mumps infection, including the estimated 30% of infections that are subclinical, confers long-lasting
immunity.
Among the reported mumps-associated complications, strong epidemiologic and laboratory evi-
dence for an association with meningoencephalitis, deafness, and orchitis has been reported (2).
Meningeal signs appear in up to 15% of cases. Reported rates of mumps encephalitis range as high as
five cases per 1000 reported mumps cases. Permanent sequelae are rare, but the reported encephalitis
case-fatality rate has averaged 1.4%. Although overall mortality is low, death due to mumps infection
is much more likely to occur in adults; about half of mumps-associated deaths have been in persons
>20 years old (2). Sensorineural deafness is one of the most serious of the rare complications
involving the central nervous system (CNS). It occurs with an estimated frequency of 0.5-5.0 per
100,000 reported mumps cases. Orchitis (usually unilateral) has been reported as a complication in
20%-30% of clinical mumps cases in postpubertal males (3). Some testicular atrophy occurs in about
35% of cases of mumps orchitis, but sterility rarely occurs. Symptomatic involvement of other organs
has been observed less frequently. There are limited experimental, clinical, and epidemiologic data
that suggest permanent pancreatic damage may result from injury caused by direct viral invasion.
Further research is needed to determine whether mumps infection contributes to the pathogenesis of
diabetes mellitus. Mumps infection during the first trimester of pregnancy may increase the rate of
spontaneous abortion (reported to be as high as 27%). There is no evidence that mumps during
pregnancy causes congenital malformations.
Epidemiology
Following the introduction of the live mumps virus vaccine in 1967 and recommendation of its
routine use in 1977, the incidence rate of reported mumps cases decreased steadily in the United
States. In 1985, a record low of 2982 cases was reported, representing a 98% decline from the 185,691
cases reported in 1967. However, between 1985 and 1987, a relative resurgence of mumps occurred,
with 7790 cases reported in 1986 and 12,848 cases in 1987 (4). During this 3-year period, the annual
reported incidence rate rose almost fivefold, from 1.1 cases per 100,000 population to 5.2 cases per
100,000 population. In 1988, a provisional total of 4730 cases was reported, representing a 62%
decrease from 1987.
As in the prevaccine era, the majority of reported mumps cases still occur in school-aged children
(5–14 years of age). Almost 60% of reported cases occurred in this population between 1985 and 1987,
compared with an average of 75% of reported cases between 1967 and 1971, the first 5-year period
postlicensure. However, for the first time since mumps became a reportable disease, the reported peak
incidence rate shifted from 5–9-year-olds to older age groups for two consecutive years (1986 and
1987). Persons >15 years of age accounted for more than one third of the reported total between 1985
and 1987; in 1967–1971, an average of only 8% of reported cases occurred among this population.


## p. 2 (#72) ###############################################

Although reported mumps incidence increased in all age groups from 1985 to 1987, the most dramatic
increases were among 10–14-year-olds (almost a sevenfold increase) and 15–19-year-olds (more than
an eightfold increase).
The increased occurrence of mumps in susceptible adolescents and young adults has been
demonstrated in several recent outbreaks in high schools and on college campuses (5,6) and in
occupational settings (7). Nonetheless, despite this age shift in reported mumps, the overall reported
risk of disease in persons 10–14 and 15 years of age is still lower than that in the prevaccine and early
postvaccine era.
Consistent with previous findings (8), reported incidence rates are lower in states with comprehen-
sive school immunization laws. The District of Columbia and 14 states that routinely reported mumps
cases in 1987 had comprehensive laws that require proof of immunity against mumps for school
attendance from kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12). In these 15 areas, the incidence rate in 1987
was 1.1 mumps cases per 100,000 population. In contrast, among the other states that routinely
reported mumps cases in 1987, mumps incidence was highest in the 14 states without requirements
for mumps vaccination (11.5 cases per 100,000 population), and intermediate (6.2 cases per 100,000
population) in the 18 states with partial vaccination requirements for school attendance (i.e., those that
include some children but do not comprehensively include K-12). Furthermore, the shift in age-specific
risk noted above occurred only in states without comprehensive K-12 school vaccination require-
ments.
Both the shift in risk to older persons and the relative resurgence of reported mumps activity noted
in recent years are attributable to the relatively underimmunized cohort of children born between 1967
and 1977 (9). There is no evidence of waning immunity in vaccinated persons. During 1967–1977, the
risk of exposure to mumps declined rapidly even though vaccination of children against mumps was
only gradually being accepted as a routine practice. Simultaneously, mumps vaccine coverage did not
reach levels >50% in any age group until 1976 (5–9-year-olds); in persons 15–19 years old, vaccine
coverage did not reach these levels until 1983. This lag in coverage relative to measles and rubella
vaccines reflects the lack of an ACIP recommendation for routine mumps vaccine until 1977 and the
lack of emphasis in ACIP recommendations on vaccination beyond toddler age until 1980. These facts
and the observed shift in risk to older persons in states without comprehensive mumps immunization
school laws provide further evidence that a failure to vaccinate, rather than vaccine failure, is primarily
responsible for the recently observed changes in mumps occurrence.
MUMPS VIRUS VACCINE
A killed mumps virus vaccine was licensed for use in the United States from 1950 through 1978. This
vaccine induced antibody, but the immunity was transient. The number of doses of killed mumps
vaccine administered between licensure of live attenuated mumps vaccine in 1967 until 1978 is
unknown but appears to have been limited.
Mumps virus vaccine* is prepared in chick-embryo cell culture. More than 84 million doses were
distributed in the United States from its introduction in December 1967 through 1988. The vaccine
produces a subclinical, noncommunicable infection with very few side effects. Mumps vaccine is
available both in monovalent (mumps only) form and in combinations: mumps-rubella and measles-
mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines.
The vaccine is approximately 95% efficacious in preventing mumps disease (10,11); >97% of
persons known to be susceptible to mumps develop measurable antibody following vaccination (12).
Vaccine-induced antibody is protective and long-lasting (13,14), although of considerably lower titer
than antibody resulting from natural infection (12). The duration of vaccine-induced immunity is
unknown, but serologic and epidemiologic data collected during 20 years of live vaccine use indicate
both the persistence of antibody and continuing protection against infection. Estimates of clinical
vaccine efficacy ranging from 75% to 95% have been calculated from data collected in outbreak
settings using different epidemiologic study designs (8,15).
Vaccine Shipment and Storage
Administration of improperly stored vaccine may fail to protect against mumps. During storage
before reconstitution, mumps vaccine must be kept at 2–8 C (35.6– 46.4 F) or colder. It must also be
protected from light, which may inactivate the virus. Vaccine must be shipped at 10 C (50 F) or colder
and may be shipped on dry ice. After reconstitution, the vaccine should be stored in a dark place at 2–8
C (35.6–46.4 F) and discarded if not used within 8 hours.

VACCINE USAGE
(See also the current ACIP statement, "General Recommendations on Immunization" (16 ).)
General Recommendations
Susceptible children, adolescents, and adults should be vaccinated against mumps, unless vacci-
nation is contraindicated. Mumps vaccine is of particular value for children approaching puberty and
for adolescents and adults who have not had mumps. MMR vaccine is the vaccine of choice for routine
administration and should be used in all situations where recipients are also likely to be susceptible to
measles and/or rubella. The favorable benefit-cost ratio for routine mumps immunization is more
marked when vaccine is administered as MMR (17). Persons should be considered susceptible to
mumps unless they have documentation of 1) physician-diagnosed mumps, 2) adequate immunization
with live mumps virus vaccine on or after their first birthday, or 3) laboratory evidence of immunity.
Because live mumps vaccine was not used routinely before 1977 and because the peak age-specific
incidence was in 5–9-year-olds before the vaccine was introduced, most persons born before 1957 are
likely to have been infected naturally between 1957 and 1977. Therefore, they generally may be
considered to be immune, even if they may not have had clinically recognizable mumps disease.
However, this cutoff date for susceptibility is arbitrary. Although outbreak-control efforts should be
focused on persons born after 1956, these recommendations do not preclude vaccination of possibly
susceptible persons born before 1957 who may be exposed in outbreak settings.
Persons who are unsure of their mumps disease history and/or mumps vaccination history should
be vaccinated. There is no evidence that persons who have previously either received mumps vaccine
or had mumps are at any increased risk of local or systemic reactions from receiving live mumps
vaccine. Testing for susceptibility before vaccination, especially among adolescents and young adults,
is not necessary. In addition to the expense, some tests (e.g., mumps skin test and the complement-
fixation antibody test) may be unreliable, and tests with established reliability (neutralization, enzyme
immunoassay, and radial hemolysis antibody tests) are not readily available.
Dosage. A single dose of vaccine in the volume specified by the manufacturer should be
administered subcutaneously. While not recommended routinely, intramuscular vaccination is effec-
tive and safe.
Age. Live mumps virus vaccine is recommended at any age on or after the first birthday for all
susceptible persons, unless a contraindication exists. Under routine circumstances, mumps vaccine
should be given in combination with measles and rubella vaccines as MMR, following the currently
recommended schedule for administration of measles vaccine. It should not be administered to infants
<12 months old because persisting maternal antibody might interfere with seroconversion. To insure
immunity, all persons vaccinated before the first birthday should be revaccinated on or after the first
birthday.
Persons Exposed to Mumps
Use of Vaccine. When given after exposure to mumps, live mumps virus vaccine may not provide
protection. However, if the exposure did not result in infection, vaccine should induce protection
against infection from subsequent exposures. There is no evidence that the risk of vaccine-associated
adverse events increases if vaccine is administered to persons incubating disease.
Use of Immune Globulin. Immune globulin (IG) has not been demonstrated to be of established
value in postexposure prophylaxis and is not recommended. Mumps immune globulin has not been
shown to be effective and is no longer available or licensed for use in the United States.
Adverse Effects of Vaccine Use
In field trials before licensure, illnesses did not occur more often in vaccinees than in unvaccinated
controls (18). Reports of illnesses following mumps vaccination have mainly been episodes of
parotitis and low-grade fever. Allergic reactions including rash, pruritus, and purpura have been
temporally associated with mumps vaccination but are uncommon and usually mild and of brief
duration. The reported occurrence of encephalitis within 30 days of receipt of a mumps-containing
vaccine (0.4 per million doses) is not greater than the observed background incidence rate of CNS
dysfunction in the normal population. Other manifestations of CNS involvement, such as febrile
seizures and deafness, have also been infrequently reported. Complete recovery is usual. Reports of
nervous system illness following mumps vaccination do not necessarily denote an etiologic relation-
ship between the illness and the vaccine.
Contraindications to Vaccine Use
Pregnancy. Although mumps vaccine virus has been shown to infect the placenta and fetus (19),
there is no evidence that it causes congenital malformations in humans. However, because of the
3


## p. 4 (#74) ###############################################

theoretical risk of fetal damage, it is prudent to avoid giving live virus vaccine to pregnant women.
Vaccinated women should avoid pregnancy for 3 months after vaccination. Routine precautions for
vaccinating postpubertal women include asking if they are or may be pregnant, excluding those who
say they are, and explaining the theoretical risk to those who plan to receive the vaccine. Vaccination
during pregnancy should not be considered an indication for termination of pregnancy. However, the
final decision about interruption of pregnancy must rest with the individual patient and her physician.
Severe Febrile Illness. Vaccine administration should not be postponed because of minor or
intercurrent febrile illnesses, such as mild upper respiratory infections. However, vaccination of
persons with severe febrile illnesses should generally be deferred until they have recovered.
Allergies. Because live mumps vaccine is produced in chick-embryo cell culture, persons with a
history of anaphylactic reactions (hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing,
hypotension, or shock) after egg ingestion should be vaccinated only with caution using published
protocols (20,21). Known allergic children should not leave the vaccination site for 20 minutes.
Evidence indicates that persons are not at increased risk if they have egg allergies that are not
anaphylactic in nature. Such persons may be vaccinated in the usual manner. There is no evidence to
indicate that persons with allergies to chickens or feathers are at increased risk of reaction to the
vaccine.
Since mumps vaccine contains trace amounts of neomycin (25 ug), persons who have experienced
anaphylactic reactions to topically or systemically administered neomycin should not receive mumps
vaccine. Most often, neomycin allergy is manifested as a contact dermatitis, which is a delayed-type
(cell-mediated) immune response, rather than anaphylaxis. In such persons, the adverse reaction, if
any, to 25 ug of neomycin in the vaccine would be an erythematous, pruritic nodule or papule at 48–96
hours. A history of contact dermatitis to neomycin is not a contraindication to receiving mumps
vaccine. Live mumps virus vaccine does not contain penicillin.
Recent IG Injection. Passively acquired antibody can interfere with the response to live, attenuated-
virus vaccines. Therefore, mumps vaccine should be given at least 2 weeks before the administration
of IG or deferred until approximately 3 months after the administration of IG.
Altered Immunity. In theory, replication of the mumps vaccine virus may be potentiated in patients
with immune deficiency diseases and by the suppressed immune responses that occur with leukemia,
lymphoma, or generalized malignancy or with therapy with corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antime-
tabolites, or radiation. In general, patients with such conditions should not be given live mumps virus
vaccine. Because vaccinated persons do not transmit mumps vaccine virus, the risk of mumps
exposure for those patients may be reduced by vaccinating their close susceptible contacts.
An exception to these general recommendations is in children infected with human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV); all asymptomatic HIV-infected children should receive MMR at 15 months of age
(22). If measles vaccine is administered to symptomatic HIV-infected children, the combination MMR
vaccine is generally preferred (23).
Patients with leukemia in remission whose chemotherapy has been terminated for at least 3 months
may also receive live mumps virus vaccine. Short-term (<2 weeks' duration) corticosteroid therapy,
topical steroid therapy (e.g., nasal, skin), and intraarticular, bursal, or tendon injection with corticos-
teroids do not contraindicate mumps vaccine administration. However, mumps vaccine should be
avoided if systemic immunosuppressive levels are reached by prolonged, extensive, topical applica-
tion.
Other. There is no known association between mumps vaccination and pancreatic damage or
subsequent development of diabetes mellitus (24).
MUMPS CONTROL
The principal strategy to prevent mumps is to achieve and maintain high immunization levels,
primarily in infants and young children. Universal immunization as a part of good health care should
be routinely carried out in physicians' offices and public health clinics. Programs aimed at vaccinating
children with MMR should be established and maintained in all communities. In addition, all other
persons thought to be susceptible should be vaccinated unless otherwise contraindicated. This is
especially important for adolescents and young adults in light of the recently observed increase in risk
of disease in these populations.
Because access to some population subgroups is limited, the ACIP recommends taking maximal
advantage of clinic visits to vaccinate susceptible persons >15 months of age by administering MMR,
diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), and oral polio vaccine (OPV) simultaneously if all are needed.
Health agencies should take necessary steps, including the development, adoption, and enforcement
4


## p. 5 (#75) ###############################################

of comprehensive immunization requirements, to ensure that all persons in schools at all grade levels
and in day-care settings are protected against mumps. Similar requirements should be considered for
colleges, as recommended by the American College Health Association (25), and selected places of
employment where persons in this age cohort are likely to be concentrated or where the consequences
of disease spread may be more severe (e.g., medical-care settings).
In determining means to control mumps outbreaks, exclusion of susceptible students from affected
schools and schools judged by local public health authorities to be at risk for transmission should be
considered. Such exclusion should be an effective means of terminating school outbreaks and quickly
increasing rates of immunization. Excluded students can be readmitted immediately after vaccination.
Pupils who have been exempted from mumps vaccination because of medical, religious, or other
reasons should be excluded until at least 26 days after the onset of parotitis in the last person with
mumps in the affected school. Experience with outbreak control for other vaccine-preventable diseases
indicates that almost all students who are excluded from the outbreak area because they lack evidence
of immunity quickly comply with requirements and can be readmitted to school.
MUMPS DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS
There is a continuing need to improve the reporting of mumps cases and complications and to
document the duration of vaccine effectiveness. Thus, for areas in which mumps is a reportable
disease, all suspected cases of mumps should be reported to local or state health officials.
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Program established by the National Child-
hood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act of 1986 requires physicians and other health-care providers
who administer vaccines to maintain permanent immunization records and to report occurrences of
certain adverse events to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Recording and reporting
requirements took effect on March 21, 1988. Reportable adverse events include those listed in the Act
for mumps (26 ) and events specified in the manufacturer's vaccine package insert as contraindications
to further doses of mumps vaccine.
Although there eventually will be one system for reporting adverse events following immunizations,
two separate systems currently exist. The appropriate reporting method currently depends on the
source of funding used to purchase the vaccine (26). Events that occur after receipt of a vaccine
purchased with public (federal, state, and/or local government) funds must be reported by the
administering health provider to the appropriate local, county, or state health department. The state
health department completes and submits the correct forms to CDC. Reportable events that follow
administration of vaccines purchased with private money are reported by the health-care provider
directly to the Food and Drug Administration.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL
Mumps is still endemic throughout most of the world. While vaccination against mumps is not a
requirement for entry into any country, susceptible children, adolescents, and adults would benefit by
being vaccinated with a single dose of vaccine (usually as MMR), unless contraindicated, before
beginning travel. Because of concern about inadequate seroconversion due to persisting maternal
antibodies and because the risk of serious disease from mumps infection is relatively low, persons <12
months of age need not be given mumps vaccine before travel.

the prevention of rubella update the previous recommendations (MMWR 1984;33:301-10,315-
8) to include implementation of a new two-dose schedule for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)
vaccine. Current information about vaccine effectiveness, duration of immunity, vaccination in
pregnancy, and progress in controlling congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is also included.
INTRODUCTION
Before licensure of rubella vaccine, rubella was a common childhood rash disease. Currently, it can
be often overlooked or misdiagnosed because its signs and symptoms vary. The most common
manifestations- postauricular and suboccipital lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, transient erythematous
and sometimes pruritic rash, and low fever-may not be recognized as rubella. Similar exanthematous
illnesses are caused by adenoviruses, enteroviruses, and other common respiratory viruses. More-
over, up to 30% of infections are subclinical and many are unrecognized. Transient polyarthralgia and
polyarthritis sometimes accompany or follow rubella. Among infected adults (particularly among
women), joint manifestations occur frequently (up to 70% of cases) and can be considered an expected
manifestation of adult infection. Central nervous system complications and thrombocytopenia have
been reported at rates of 1 per 6,000 cases and 1 per 3,000 cases, respectively. The former is more likely
to occur among adults; the latter, among children.
By far the most important consequences of rubella are the miscarriages, stillbirths, fetal anomalies,
and therapeutic abortions that result from rubella infection in early pregnancy, especially in the first
trimester. Preventing fetal infection and consequent congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is the objective
of rubella immunization programs.
The most commonly described anomalies associated with CRS are auditory (sensorineural deaf-
ness), ophthalmic (cataracts, microphthalmia, glaucoma, chorioretinitis), cardiac (patent ductus
arteriosus, pulmonary artery stenosis, atrial or ventricular septal defects), and neurologic (microceph-
aly, meningoencephalitis, mental retardation). In addition, infants with CRS frequently are retarded in
growth and have radiolucent bone disease, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and purpuric
skin lesions (blueberry-muffin appearance). Moderate and severe cases of CRS are readily recogniz-
able at birth; mild cases (e.g., those with only slight cardiac involvement or deafness) may not be
detected for months or years after birth or not at all. Although CRS has been estimated to occur among
20%-25% or more of infants born to women who acquire rubella during the first trimester, the actual
risk of infection and subsequent defects may be considerably higher. If infants infected in the first
trimester are followed for at least 2 years, up to 85% (1) will be found to be affected. The risk of any
defect declines approximately 10%-24% for infections that occur between the 13th and 16th weeks of
gestation, with defects rarely occurring after infection beyond the 20th week. However, fetal infection
without clinical stigmata of CRS can occur at any stage of pregnancy. Inapparent maternal rubella
infection can also result in congenital malformations.
In 1983, the average lifetime expenditure associated with an infant with CRS was estimated to be
more than $200,000 (2), which included costs associated with institutionalization of the retarded, blind,
and/or deaf and the education of hearing- and sight-impaired teenagers and adolescents.
Postinfection immunity appears to be long-lasting. However, as with other viral diseases, reexpo-
sure to natural rubella occasionally leads to reinfection without clinical illness or detectable viremia.
Because many rash illnesses may mimic rubella infection and many rubella infections are unrecog-
nized, the only reliable evidence of immunity to rubella is the presence of specific antibody.
Laboratories that regularly perform antibody testing are generally the most reliable because their
reagents and procedures are strictly standardized (see Laboratory Diagnosis section).
Before rubella vaccines became available in 1969, most rubella cases occurred among school-age
children. Because control of rubella in the United States was originally based on interrupting
1

transmission, the primary target group for vaccination was children of both sexes. Secondary
emphasis was placed on vaccinating susceptible adolescents and young adults, especially females. By
1977, vaccination of children >12 months of age had resulted in a marked decline in the reported
rubella incidence among children and had interrupted the characteristic 6- to 9-year rubella epidemic
cycle. However, this vaccination strategy had less effect on reported rubella incidence among persons
>15 years of age (i.e., the childbearing ages for women). This age group subsequently accounted for
>70% of reported rubella patients with known ages. Approximately 10%-20% of this latter population
continued to be susceptible. This proportion was similar to that of prevaccine years, and reported CRS
continued at a low but relatively constant endemic level (an annual average of 32 reported confirmed
and compatible* cases between 1971 and 1977).
Beginning in the late 1970s, increased efforts were made to vaccinate junior and senior high school
students effectively and to enforce rubella immunization requirements for school entry (3). Efforts
were made to vaccinate all susceptible military recruits. Published accounts of rubella outbreaks in
hospitals caused concern about the need to screen and/or vaccinate susceptible personnel. Many
states stressed the need for ensuring proof of rubelia immunity (i.e., documentation of vaccination or
seropositivity) for college entrance. These efforts, combined with the 1977 Childhood Immunization
Initiative and the 1978 Measles Elimination effort (which encouraged use of combined vaccines
containing measles and rubella antigens), have led to decreases in reported rubella in all age groups
(4,5). The value of this strategy is exemplified by the experience with vaccinating all military recruits,
which has virtually eliminated rubella from military bases (6). Similar results could be achieved by
ensuring proof of immunity of all employees, all college students and staff, all prison personnel, and
all hospital personnel, including physicians, nurses, health-profession students, technicians, and
dietary workers.
The number of rubella vaccine doses administered annually in the public sector to persons 15
years of age increased more than tenfold from 28,000 doses in 1977 to >300,000 doses per year from
1980 through 1988. It is likely that use of rubella vaccine for postpubertal adults was even higher in the
private sector. By 1980, reported incidence rates among adolescents and young adults were lower than
those among young children. Children <5 years of age have accounted for approximately one-fourth
to one-third of cases throughout the 1980s.
In 1988, 225 cases of postnatal rubella were reported, the lowest annual total ever reported to CDC.
Only 38% (48 of 127) of rubella cases for which age was known were reported among persons >15
years of age. The estimated incidence rate for persons >15 years of age was the lowest ever
reported -0.04 per 100,000 persons. Provisional data showed that a modest resurgence in annual
number of reported rubella cases occurred in 1989. However, the 373 cases reported represented only
a small fraction of the 60,000 cases reported in 1969 when vaccine became available.
With the decrease in incidence of rubella in postpubertal age groups, the reported number of infants
born with CRS declined from 20-70 annual cases in the 1970s to only two cases in 1985, and CRS is on
the verge of elimination (7). Nevertheless, the provisional data indicate that infants with CRS continue
to be born (the number of reported births of children with indigenous CRS has ranged from 13 for 1986
to one for 1989). From 6% to 11% of postpubertal females may remain seronegative, according to data
from premarital screening programs in selected states (8), and higher rates of seronegativity have
been reported (9). Prevention of CRS and rubella in postpubertal populations continues to deserve
attention (10).
LIVE RUBELLA VIRUS VACCINE
The live rubella virus vaccine* currently distributed in the United States is prepared in human
diploid cell culture. In January 1979, this vaccine (RA 27/3) replaced the HPV-77:DE-5 vaccine grown in
duck embryo cell culture because it induced higher seroresponse, greater resistance to reinfection, and
*A confirmed case has at least one defect in categories A or B and laboratory confirmation of rubella infection. A

lower reaction rate. Although both subcutaneous and intranasal administration of the vaccine have
been studied, the vaccine is licensed only for subcutaneous administration. The vaccine is produced in
monovalent form (rubella only) and in combinations: measles-rubella (MR), rubella-mumps, and
measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines.
In clinical trials, >95% of susceptible persons who received a single dose of rubella vaccine when
they were >12 months of age developed antibody (11-13). Clinical efficacy and challenge studies have
shown that >90% of vaccinees have protection against both clinical rubella and viremia for at least 15
years (14-17). Available follow-up studies indicate that vaccine-induced protection is long-term,
probably lifelong; therefore, a history of vaccination can be considered presumptive evidence of
immunity.
Although vaccine-induced titers are generally lower than those stimulated by rubella infection
(18,19), vaccine-induced immunity usually protects against both clinical illness and viremia after
natural exposure. In studies that have attempted to reinfect persons artificially who received RA 27/3
vaccine, vaccinees demonstrated a resistance to reinfection similar to the resistance that follows
natural infection (20). A small number of reports have indicated that viremic reinfection following
exposure may occur in vaccinated individuals with low levels of detectable antibody (15). The
frequency and consequences of this phenomenon are currently unknown but believed to be rare.
These reports are to be expected, because there are also rare reports of clinical reinfection and fetal
infection following disease-induced immunity (21).
Some vaccinees intermittently shed small amounts of virus from the pharynx 7-28 days after
vaccination. However, studies of >1,200 susceptible household contacts and experience gained over
20 years of vaccine use failed to identify transmission of vaccine virus. These findings indicate that
vaccinating susceptible children whose mothers or other household contacts are pregnant does not
present a risk. Rather, vaccination of such children provides protection for these pregnant women.
VACCINE USE
Rubella Immunity
Persons can be considered immune to rubella only if they have documentation of a) laboratory
evidence of rubella immunity or b) adequate immunization with at least one dose of rubella vaccine on
or after the first birthday. Many persons will receive two doses of rubella vaccine as a result of the new
two-dose schedule for MMR vaccination, which is recommended to improve control of measles (22).
Clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable and should not be considered in assessing immune status.
General Recommendations
Persons >12 months of age should be vaccinated, unless they are immune. All children, adoles-
cents, and adults, particularly females - are considered susceptible and should be vaccinated if there
are no contraindications (see section on PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS). Those who
should be vaccinated include persons who may be immune to rubella but who lack adequate
documentation of immunity. All vaccinations should be documented in the patient's permanent
medical record (23).
Vaccinating susceptible individuals both protects them against rubella and prevents their spreading
the virus. Vaccinating susceptible postpubertal females confers individual protection against rubella-
induced fetal injury. Vaccinating adolescents or adults in high-risk population groups, such as those in
colleges, places of employment, or military bases, protects them against rubella and reduces the
chance of epidemics.
Dosage
The dose of 0.5 ml of reconstituted vaccine (whether as a monovalent product or, preferably, in
combination with measles and mumps antigens) should be administered subcutaneously.
Age at Vaccination
Live rubella virus vaccine is recommended for all children >12 months of age. It should not usually
be given to younger infants, because persisting maternal antibodies may interfere with seroconver-

sion. When the rubella vaccine is part of a combination that includes the measles antigen, the
combination vaccine should generally be given to children at 15 months of age to maximize measles
seroconversion. A second dose of MMR is recommended at school entry, although in some localities
the decision may be made to administer the second dose at older ages (e.g., entry to middle or junior
high school) (21,24). Initial vaccination with MMR may be given at 12 months of age to children living
in areas at high risk for measles transmission among preschool-age children (i.e., a county with >5
cases among preschool-age children during each of the last 5 years, a county with a recent outbreak
among unvaccinated preschool-age children, or a county with a large inner-city, urban population).
These recommendations may be implemented for an entire county or in smaller, defined, high-risk
areas (21 ). MMR may be administered to children before their first birthday if monovalent measles
vaccine is not readily available. Infants vaccinated with MMR before the first birthday should be
considered unvaccinated for purposes of determining the need for further vaccination. They should be
revaccinated with rubella, measles, and mumps vaccines, preferably by starting the two-dose schedule
of MMR with a first dose given generally at 15 months of age.
Older children who have not received rubella vaccine should be vaccinated promptly. Because a
history of rubella illness is not a reliable indicator of immunity, all children should be vaccinated unless
there are contraindications (see section on PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS).
Vaccination of Women of Childbearing Age
The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) has weighed several factors in developing
recommendations for vaccinating women of childbearing age against rubella. Although there may be
concern about giving rubella vaccine during pregnancy, available data on previously and currently
available rubella vaccines indicate that the risk of teratogenicity from live rubella vaccines is small.
From January 1971 to April 1989, CDC followed to term 321 known rubella-susceptible pregnant
women who had been vaccinated with live rubella vaccine within 3 months before or 3 months after
conception. Ninety-four women received HPV-77 or Cendehill vaccines, one received vaccine of
unknown strain, and 226 received RA 27/3 vaccine. None of the 324 infants (three of the mothers
receiving RA 27/3 vaccine delivered twins) had malformations compatible with congenital rubella
infection. This total included the five infants who were born to these susceptible women and who had
serologic evidence of subclinical infection. (Three of the infants were exposed to HPV-77 or Cendehill
vaccine; two were exposed to RA 27/3 vaccine.)
On the basis of the experience to date, the estimated risk of serious malformations attributable to RA
27/3 rubella vaccine, derived from the binomial distribution with 95% confidence limits, is from 0% to
1.6%. (If the susceptible infants exposed to other rubella vaccines are included, the risk is from 0% to
1.2%.) This risk is substantially less than the >20% risk of CRS associated with maternal infection
during the first trimester of pregnancy (25). Moreover, the observed risk with both the HPV-77 or
Cendehill and RA 27/3 strains of vaccine is zero.
Rubella vaccine virus has been isolated from aborted tissue from one (3%) of 35 susceptible women
who had been given RA 27/3 vaccine while pregnant, whereas virus was isolated from aborted tissue
from 17 (20%) of 85 susceptible women who had been given HPV-77 or Cendehill vaccines while
pregnant. This finding provides additional evidence that the RA 27/3 vaccine poses no greater risk of
teratogenicity than did the HPV-77 or Cendehill vaccines.
The risk of vaccine-associated defects is negligible and should not ordinarily be a reason to consider
interruption of pregnancy. Because birth defects, one-third of which are serious, are noted in 3% of all
births, confusion about the etiology of birth defects may result if vaccine is administered during
pregnancy.
As of April 30, 1989, CDC discontinued accepting new enrollees into its registry of women vaccinated
with rubella vaccine during pregnancy. However, all suspected cases of CRS, whether presumed to be
due to wild-virus or vaccine-virus infection, should continue to be reported through state and local
health departments.
The continuing occurrence of rubella among women of childbearing age (9) and the lack of evidence
for teratogenicity from the vaccine strongly indicate the need to continue vaccination of susceptible
adolescent and adult females of childbearing age. However, because of concern about risk for the
fetus, women of childbearing age should receive vaccine only if they state that they are not pregnant
and are counseled not to become pregnant for 3 months after vaccination. In view of the importance
of protecting this age group against rubella, reasonable practices in a rubella immunization program
include a) asking women if they are pregnant, b) excluding those who state that they are, c) explaining
4


## p. 5 (#83) ###############################################

the concern about risk for the fetus to the others, and d) explaining the importance of not becoming
pregnant during the 3 months following vaccination.
Use of Vaccine Following Exposure to Rubella
There is no conclusive evidence that giving live rubella virus vaccine following exposure will prevent
illness. However, a single exposure may not cause infection. Because postexposure vaccination will
protect an individual exposed in the future, and because there is no evidence that vaccinating an
individual who is incubating rubella is harmful, vaccination is still recommended, unless otherwise
contraindicated.
Use of Human Immune Globulin Following Exposure to Rubella
Immune globulin (IG) given after exposure to rubella will not prevent infection or viremia, but it may
modify or suppress symptoms and create an unwarranted sense of security. The routine use of IG for
postexposure prophylaxis of rubella in early pregnancy is not recommended. Infants with congenital
rubella have been born to women who were given IG shortly after exposure. The only instance in
which IG might be useful would be when a pregnant woman who has been exposed to rubella would
not consider termination of pregnancy under any circumstances.
Recent Administration of IG
Vaccine should be administered approximately 2 weeks before or deferred for approximately 3
months after receipt of IG, because passively acquired antibodies might interfere with the response to
the vaccine. However, previous administration of anti-Rho (D) IG (human) or blood products does not
generally interfere with an immune response and is not a contraindication to postpartum vaccination.
In this situation, persons who have received the globulin or blood products should be serologically
tested 6-8 weeks after vaccination to assure that seroconversion has occurred. Obtaining laboratory
evidence of seroconversion in other vaccinees is not necessary.
Vaccine Shipment and Storage
During storage, before reconstitution, rubella vaccine must be kept at a temperature of 2 C-8 C (35.6
F-46.4 F) or colder. It must also be protected from light, which may inactivate the virus. Reconstituted
vaccine should be discarded if not used within 8 hours. Vaccine must be shipped at 10 C (50 F) or colder
and may be shipped on dry ice.
ADVERSE EVENTS
Vaccinees can develop low-grade fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy after vaccination. Arthralgia
and transient arthritis occur more frequently in susceptible adults than in children, and more frequently
in susceptible postpubertal females than in susceptible men. Arthralgia or arthritis are rare following
vaccination of children with RA 27/3 vaccine (10). By contrast, approximately 25% of susceptible
postpubertal females develop arthralgia following RA 27/3 vaccination, and approximately 10% have
been reported to have arthritis-like signs and symptoms (26-28). Rarely, transient peripheral neuritic
complaints, such as paresthesias and pain in the arms and legs, have occurred (29).
When joint symptoms occur, or when pain and/or paresthesias not associated with joints occur, they
generally begin 1-3 weeks after vaccination, persist for 1 day-3 weeks, and rarely recur. Adults with
joint symptoms following rubella vaccination usually have not had to disrupt work activities.
Infrequently, susceptible vaccinees, primarily adult females, reportedly have developed chronic or
recurrent arthralgias, sometimes with arthritis or neurologic symptoms including paresthesias, carpal
tunnel syndrome, and blurred vision. Onset of these symptoms occurred within 1 month of initial
vaccination. One group of investigators has reported the frequency of chronic joint symptoms and
signs in adult females to be as high as 5%-11% (30,31 ); however, other data from the United States
and experience from other countries that use the RA 27/3 strain suggest that such occurrences are rare.
In comparative studies, the frequency of chronic joint complaints is substantially higher following
natural infection than following vaccination (31 ).
The mechanism for joint abnormalities after vaccination is unclear. Joint destruction rarely has been
reported (32). One group of investigators has reported that viral persistence in peripheral blood
5


## p. 6 (#84) ###############################################

lymphocytes has occurred among a substantial number of these patients (33). This same group has
postulated that defective immunity, in the form of partial antibody, detected by an enzyme immunoas-
say (EIA) kit but not by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assay, may facilitate viral persistence (30,34).
No conclusive evidence has shown that immune complexes play a role in disease pathogenesis.
Rubella virus has been isolated from both peripheral blood lymphocytes and synovial cells from
children with chronic arthritis, primarily juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; however, a causal relationship
has not been proven (35).
Available published data indicate that only susceptible vaccinees have side effects of vaccination
(36). There is no conclusive evidence of an increased risk of these reactions for persons who are
already immune when vaccinated.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
Pregnancy
Pregnant women should not be vaccinated with rubella vaccine. If a pregnant woman is vaccinated
or if she becomes pregnant within 3 months after vaccination, she should be counseled about the
concern for the fetus, but rubella vaccination during pregnancy should not ordinarily be a reason to
consider interruption of pregnancy.
Febrile Illness
Vaccination of persons with severe febrile illness should be postponed until recovery. However,
susceptible children with mild illnesses, such as upper respiratory infection, should be vaccinated.
Considering the importance of protecting against rubella, medical personnel should use every
opportunity to vaccinate susceptible individuals.
Allergies
Hypersensitivity reactions rarely follow the administration of live rubella vaccine. Most of these
reactions are considered minor and consist of wheal and flare or urticaria at the injection site.
Live rubella vaccine is produced in human diploid cell culture. Consequently, a history of
anaphylactic reactions to egg ingestion needs to be taken into consideration only if measles or mumps
antigens are to be included with rubella vaccine.
Since rubella vaccine contains trace amounts of neomycin (25 ug), persons who have experienced
anaphylactic reactions to topically or systemically administered neomycin should not receive rubella
vaccine. Most often, neomycin allergy is manifested as a contact dermatitis, which is a delayed-type
(cell-mediated) immune response, rather than anaphylaxis. In such individuals, the adverse reaction,
if any, to neomycin in the vaccine would be an erythematous, pruritic nodule or papule at 48-96 hours.
A history of contact dermatitis to neomycin is not a contraindication to receiving rubella vaccine. No
preparations of live rubella vaccine contain penicillin.
Altered Immunocompetence
Replication of vaccine viruses can be enhanced in persons with immune deficiency diseases and in
persons with immunosuppression, as occurs with leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or
resulting from therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large doses of corticos-
teroids. Although there is no evidence that wild rubella or rubella vaccine virus causes serious illness
in immunocompromised persons, concern exists about the risk of any live virus vaccine, including
rubella vaccine, for such persons. Therefore, such patients should not be given live rubella virus
vaccine - except persons with symptomatic infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), who
can receive MMR (see below).
Patients with leukemia in remission who have not received chemotherapy for at least 3 months may
be vaccinated with live virus vaccines. Short-term (<2 weeks), low- to moderate-dose systemic
corticosteroid therapy, topical steroid therapy (e.g., nasal, skin), long-term alternate-day treatment
with low to moderate doses of short-acting systemic steroids, and intraarticular, bursal, or tendon
injection of corticosteroids are not immunosuppressivo in their usual dosos and do not contraindicate
rubella vaccine administration.

## p. 7 (#85) ###############################################

The growing number of infants and preschoolers with HIV infection has directed special attention to
the appropriate immunization of such children. Asymptomatic children do not need to be evaluated
and tested for HIV infection before decisions concerning vaccination are made. Asymptomatic
HIV-infected persons in need of MMR should receive it. MMR should be considered for all symptomatic
HIV-infected children, including children diagnosed as having acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS), because measles disease in these children can be severe. Limited data on MMR vaccination
among asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV-infected children indicate that MMR has not been
associated with serious or unusual adverse events, although antibody responses have been variable
(37-39).
The administration of high-dose intravenous immune globulin (GIV) to HIV-infected children at
regular intervals is being studied to determine whether it will prevent a variety of infections. For those
children who have received IGIV within the 3 months preceding vaccination, MMR vaccine may be
ineffective.
SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF CERTAIN LIVE VIRUS VACCINES
In general, the simultaneous administration of the most widely used live and inactivated vaccines
does not impair antibody responses or increase rates of adverse reactions (40,41 ). The administration
of MMR vaccine yields results similar to that of individual measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines at
different sites or at different times.
Equivalent antibody responses and no clinically important increases in the frequency of adverse
events occur when diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP), Haemophilus influenzae b conjugate
vaccine (HDCV), oral polio vaccine (OPV), or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) are administered with MMR
either simultaneously at different sites or at separate times. Routine simultaneous administration of
MMR, DTP, HbCV, and OPV (or iPV) to all children >15 months who are eligible to receive these
vaccines is recommended. Vaccination with MMR and HbCV at 15 months, followed by DTP and OPV
(or IPV) at 18 months remains an acceptable alternative for children whose parents/caregivers are
known generally to follow health-care recommendations. If the child might not be brought back for
future immunizations, simultaneous administration of all vaccines (including DTP, OPV, MMR, and
HbCV) appropriate to the age and previous vaccination status of the recipient is recommended.
REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires physicians and other health-care
providers who administer vaccines to maintain permanent immunization records and to report
occurrences of adverse events specified in the Act (22). These adverse events, as well as other adverse
events that require medical attention, must be reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Until November 1, 1990, separate systems for reporting adverse events existed for vaccines purchased with public
funding and for vaccines purchased in the private sector. After November 1, 1990, all reportable events should be
reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Adverse events other than those specified in
the Act, especially events that are serious or unusual, should also be reported to VAERS. VAERS forms and
instructions are available in the Food and Drug Administration's FDA Drug Bulletin and the Physicians' Desk
Reference, or they may be obtained by calling VAERS at 1-800-822-7967.
STRATEGIES FOR ELIMINATING CRS
The widespread vaccination of school-age children since 1969 has effectively prevented major
epidemics of rubella and congenital rubella in the United States. With continued vaccination of
children at levels approaching 100%, an immune birth cohort will eventually replace the 6%-25% of
persons of childbearing age currently susceptible to rubella, and rubella can be expected to disappear.
Recent data suggest that the rates of rubella susceptibility among postpubertal females and in reported
cases of rubella continue to decline (7,8). Because the process of replacing the adult cohort with
immune persons will take years, cases of CRS can still be expected to occur (42-45).
7


## p. 8 (#86) ###############################################

Elimination of CRS can be hastened by expanding existing efforts to vaccinate susceptible
adolescents and young adults, particularly females of childbearing age, along with continuing routine
vaccination of children. In 1985-1988, 40%-60% of the rubella cases occurred in older, postadolescent
populations, clearly indicating that rubella in postpubertal populations still occurs. Effective vaccina-
tion of all susceptible children in junior and senior high schools can be expected to contribute greatly
to the elimination of CRS. Such efforts have resulted in decreases in the reported incidence of rubella
in all persons and in the incidence of reported CRS.
The major components of a strategy to eliminate CRS are achieving and maintaining high
immunization levels, accurate surveillance of rubella and CRS, and prompt outbreak-control measures.
The following recommendations are presented to help preserve the level of rubella and CRS control
already achieved and to bring about the further reduction in susceptibility that will be required to
eliminate CRS.
Ongoing Programs
The primary strategy for eliminating CRS in the United States is to interrupt rubella transmission by
achieving and maintaining high immunization levels among all children. Official health agencies
should take steps, including developing and enforcing immunization requirements, to ensure that all
students in grades kindergarten through 12 are protected against rubella, unless vaccination is
contraindicated. School-entry laws should be vigorously enforced. States that do not require proof of
immunity of students at all grade levels should consider expanding existing laws or regulations to
include the age groups not yet protected.
Recent age-specific data indicate that preschool-age children account for an important proportion of
reported rubella cases. Proof of rubella immunity for attendance at day-care centers should be required
and enforced. Licensure should depend on such requirements.
To hasten the elimination of CRS, continued effort should be directed toward vaccinating suscep-
tible women of childbearing age. A multifaceted approach is necessary (46).
General Principles
Voluntary vaccination programs have been less successful than mandatory programs. The
military services require rubella immunity of recruits and have essentially eliminated rubella from
military bases (6). In all settings where young adults congregate, men and women should be
included in vaccination programs, because men may transmit disease to susceptible women.
• If it is practical and if reliable laboratory services are available, women of childbearing age who
are potential candidates for vaccination can have serologic tests to determine susceptibility to
rubella. However, with the exception of premarital and prenatal screening, routinely performing
serologic tests for all women of childbearing age to determine susceptibility (so that vaccine is
given only to proven susceptible women) can be effective but is expensive. Also, two visits to the
health-care provider would be necessary-one for screening and one for vaccination. Accordingly,
rubella vaccination of a woman who is not known to be pregnant and has no history of vaccination
is justifiable without serologic testing, and may be preferable, particularly when costs of serology
are high and follow-up of identified susceptible women for vaccination is not assured. Vaccinated
women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for a 3-month period following
vaccination. Routine serologic screening of men is not recommended.
• Vaccine should be administered only if there is no contraindication to vaccination.
• Health-care providers are encouraged to use MMR in routine childhood-vaccination programs and
whenever rubella vaccine is to be given to persons also likely to be susceptible to measles and/or
mumps.
Premarital Screening and Vaccination
Routine premarital testing for rubella antibody identifies many susceptible women before preg-
nancy (47). Documented histories of rubella vaccination or serologic evidence of immunity should be
considered acceptable proof of immunity. To ensure a significant reduction in susceptibility through
premarital screening, more aggressive follow-up of women found to be susceptible is required.
Postpartum Vaccination
Prenatal screening should be carried out on all pregnant women not known to be immune. Women
who have just delivered babies should be vaccinated before discharge from the hospital, unless they
8


## p. 8 (#87) ###############################################

are known to be immune (48). Although such women are unlikely to become pregnant, counseling to
avoid conception for 3 months following vaccination is still necessary. It is estimated that postpartum
vaccination of all women not known to be immune could have prevented approximately 40% of recent
CRS cases (4,6). Breast-feeding is not a contraindication to vaccination, even though virus may be
excreted in breast milk, and infants may be infected (49-51). Women attending abortion clinics should
be vaccinated after termination of pregnancy.
Routine Vaccination in any Medical Setting
Vaccination of susceptible women of childbearing age should be part of routine general medical and
gynecologic outpatient care, should take place in all family-planning settings, and should become
routine before discharge from a hospital for any reason, if there are no contraindications (see section
on PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS). Vaccination should be offered to adults, especially
women of childbearing age, any time that contact is made with the health-care system, including when
children are undergoing routine examinations or immunizations.
Vaccination of Medical Personnel
Medical personnel, both male and female (e.g., volunteers, trainees, nurses, physicians), who might
transmit rubella to pregnant patients or other personnel, should be immune to rubella. Consideration
should be given to making rubella immunity a condition for employment (52-55). All medical
personnel who have patient contact and who are beginning employment should have proof of rubella
immunity or prior vaccination.
Vaccination of Workers
Ascertainment of rubella-immune status and availability of rubella immunization should be
components of the health-care program, in places employing women of childbearing age (e.g.,
day-care centers, schools, colleges, prisons (56), companies (57), government offices, and industrial
sites).
Vaccination for College Entry
Colleges are high-risk areas for rubella transmission because of large concentrations of susceptible
persons (58,59 ). Proof of rubella as well as measles immunity should be required for attendance for
both male and female students. All students born in or after 1957 who enter institutions of
post-high-school education should have documentation of receipt of two doses of measles vaccine
(preferably given as MMR) and at least one dose of rubella vaccine or other evidence of measles and
rubella immunity (21).
Outbreak Control
Outbreak control will continue to play an important role in eliminating CRS. Aggressive responses
to outbreaks may interrupt chains of transmission and will increase vaccination coverage among
persons who might otherwise not be protected. Although methods for controlling rubella outbreaks
are evolving, the main strategy should be to define target populations, ensure that susceptible persons
are vaccinated rapidly (or excluded from exposure if a contraindication exists), and maintain active
surveillance to permit modification of control measures if the situation changes.
Laboratory confirmation of rubella cases is important; however, control measures should be
implemented before serologic confirmation. This approach is especially important in any outbreak
setting involving pregnant women (e.g., obstetric-gynecologic and prenatal clinics). All persons at risk
who cannot readily provide laboratory evidence of immunity or a documented history of vaccination
on or after their first birthday should be considered susceptible and should be vaccinated if there are
no contraindications.
An effective means of terminating outbreaks and increasing rates of immunization quickly is to
exclude from possible contact individuals who cannot provide valid evidence of immunity. Experience
with measles-outbreak control indicates that almost all students who are excluded from school
because they lack evidence of measles immunity quickly comply with requirements and are promptly
readmitted to school. All persons who have been exempted from rubella vaccination because of
medical, religious, or other reasons should also be excluded from attendance. Exclusion should
9


## p. 10 (#88) ##############################################

continue until 3 weeks after the onset of rash of the last reported case in the outbreak setting. Less
rigorous approaches, such as voluntary appeals for vaccination, have not been effective in terminating
outbreaks.
Mandatory exclusion and vaccination of adults should be practiced in rubella outbreaks in medical
settings because pregnant women may be exposed. This approach may be successful in terminating,
or at least limiting, outbreaks. Vaccination during an outbreak has not been associated with substantial
personnel absenteeism. Vaccination of susceptible persons before an outbreak occurs is preferable,
because vaccination causes far less absenteeism and disruption of routine work activities than does
rubella infection.
SURVEILLANCE
Surveillance of rubella and CRS has three purposes: a) to provide important data on program
progress and long-term trends, b) to help define groups in greatest need of vaccination and in turn
provide information for formulation of new strategies, and c) to evaluate vaccine efficacy, duration of
vaccine-induced immunity, and other issues related to vaccine safety and efficacy.
As the rates of rubella and CRS decline in the United States, effective surveillance becomes
increasingly important. Known or suspected rubella cases should be reported immediately to local
health departments. Because an accurate assessment of CRS elimination can be made only through
aggressive case finding, surveillance of CRS will have to be intensified.
Surveillance of rubella is complicated by the fact that the symptoms of the clinical disease are not
distinctive and can be confused with a number of other illnesses. Thus, cases should be laboratory
confirmed, particularly outside of the outbreak setting. Similarly, laboratory confirmation of suspected
cases of CRS is also necessary, because the constellation of findings of CRS may not be specific.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Rubella Serologic Testing for Evidence of Immunity
Until recently, Hl antibody testing was the most frequently used method of screening for the
presence of rubella antibodies. However, the HI test has been supplanted in many settings by a number
of equally or more sensitive commercial assays to determine rubella immunity. EIAs are the most
commonly used of these newer commercial assays, but latex agglutination, immunofluorescence
assay (IFA), passive hemagglutination, hemolysis-in-gel, and virus neutralization tests are also
available.
When adults who have not produced detectable Hl antibodies following vaccination have been
examined more closely, almost all have had detectable antibody by a specific but more sensitive test
(60,61 ). Similarly, a small number of children who initially seroconverted have subsequently lost
detectable HI antibody during up to 16 years of follow-up (62-64). However, almost all had detectable
antibody by more sensitive tests. Immunity in a number of these children was confirmed by
documenting a booster response (i.e., absence of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody and a rapid rise
in immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody) following revaccination (13,65 ).
Although some individuals have antibody levels following previous vaccination or infection that are
below levels detectable by Hl antibody testing, the clinical significance of such low-level antibody has
not been as well documented as that of higher levels of antibody. Limited data suggest that, on rare
occasions, infection with viremia can occur in persons with low antibody levels. CRS following
reinfection has been documented, although such instances have been rare (20). Further study is
warranted to assess the appropriate interpretation of antibodies detectable only by these more
sensitive tests (14,17). Nevertheless, available data continue to support the presumption that any
antibody level that is measured by a licensed assay and is above the standard positive cutoff value for
that assay can be considered evidence of immunity.
Rubella
The diagnosis of acute rubella should be confirmed serologically. The presence of IgM antibody or
a significant rise in IgG or total antibody levels is evidence of acute rubella infection (66 ). For HI assays,
a fourfold rise in the titer of antibody indicates recent infection; for other types of assays, the criteria
for a significant rise in antibody level vary by type of assay and by laboratory. The acute-phase serum,
specimen should be drawn as soon after rash onset as possible, preferably within the first 7 days. The
10


## p. 11 (#89) ##############################################

convalescent-phase serum specimen should be drawn 10 or more days after the acute-phase serum
specimen. If the acute-phase serum specimen is drawn more than 7 days after rash onset, a significant
rise in antibody titer may not be detected by most commonly used tests. In this case, complement
fixation (CF) testing may be especially useful, because CF antibodies appear in serum later than HI, EIA,
or IFA antibodies. The acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens should be tested simulta-
neously in the same laboratory.
Occasionally, significant rises may not be detected, even if the first specimen is drawn within the
first 7 days after rash onset. Rubella infection may also be serologically confirmed by demonstrating
rubella-specific IgM antibody. If IgM is to be determined, one serum specimen should be drawn
between 1 week and 2 weeks after rash onset. Although rubella-specific IgM antibody may be detected
shortly after rash onset, IgM antibody is less likely to be detected if the specimen is drawn earlier than
1 week or later than 4-5 weeks following rash onset. False-negative IgM antibody test results may
sometimes occur even when the specimen is appropriately drawn. False-positive IgM test results may
also occur.
In the absence of rash illness, the diagnosis of subclinical cases of rubella can be facilitated by
obtaining the acute-phase serum specimen as soon as possible after exposure. The convalescent-
phase specimen should then be drawn 28 or more days after exposure. If acute- and convalescent-
phase paired sera provide inconclusive results, rubella-specific IgM antibody testing can be performed,
but results should be interpreted cautiously. Expert consultation may be necessary to interpret the
data.
Confirmation of rubella infection in pregnant women of unknown immune status following rash
illness or exposure may be difficult. A serum specimen should be obtained as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, serologic results are often nonconfirmatory. Such situations can be minimized by
performing prenatal serologies routinely. In addition, health providers should request that laboratories
performing prenatal screening retain such specimens until delivery so that retesting, if necessary, can
be done.
Congenital Rubella
Suspected cases of CRS should be managed with contact isolation (see CDC “Guidelines for
Isolation Precautions in Hospitals”). While diagnostic confirmation is pending, children with suspected
CRS should be cared for only by personnel known to be immune. Confirmation by attempting virus
isolation can be done by using nasopharyngeal and urine specimens. Serologic confirmation can be
obtained by testing cord blood for the presence of rubella-specific IgM antibodies. An alternative but
less rapid serologic method is to document persistence of rubella-specific antibody in an infant with
suspected CRS, age 3 months or older, at a level beyond that expected from passive transfer of
maternal antibody, i.e., a rubella antibody level in the infant that does not decline at the expected rate
(the equivalent of one twofold dilution in HI titer per month). However, some infected infants may lose
antibody because of agammaglobulinemia or dysgammaglobulinemia.
In some infants with CRS, virus can persist and be isolated for the first year of life. CRS precautions
need to be exercised through the first year of life, unless nasopharyngeal and urine cultures are
negative for rubella virus.
INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL
Persons without evidence of rubella immunity who travel abroad should be vaccinated against
rubella because rubella is endemic and even epidemic in many countries throughout the world. No
immunization or record of immunization is required for entry into the United States. However,
international travelers should have immunity to rubella (i.e., laboratory evidence of rubella antibodies
or verified rubella vaccination on or after the first birthday). Protection is especially important for
susceptible women of childbearing age, particularly those planning to remain out of the country for a
prolonged period.

Measles Prevention:
Recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
These revised recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) on
Measles Prevention replace previous recommendations published in 1987 (1) and 1989 (2). The
recommendations include a basic change in the routine childhood vaccination schedule from a
one-dose to a two-dose schedule using combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Routine
revaccination will generally be implemented one age group at a time starting with school enterers.
New recommendations are also included for vaccination of preschool children at high risk of
contracting measles, for students in colleges and other institutions of higher education, for health-care
personnel and international travelers, and for outbreak control.
INTRODUCTION
Measles (rubeola) is often a severe disease, frequently complicated by middle ear infection or
bronchopneumonia. Encephalitis occurs in approximately one of every 1,000 reported cases; survivors
of this complication often have permanent brain damage and mental retardation. Death, usually from
respiratory and neurologic causes, occurs in one of every 1,000 reported measles cases. The risk of
death is greater for infants and adults than for children and adolescents.
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a "slow virus” infection of the central nervous system
associated with measles virus. Widespread use of measles vaccine has led to the virtual disappearance
of SSPE from the United States (3).
Measles illness during pregnancy leads to increased rates of premature labor, spontaneous
abortion, and low-birth-weight infants (4,5). Whether measles infection in the first trimester of
pregnancy is associated with an increased rate of congenital malformations is still unresolved.
Before measles vaccine was available, more than 400,000 measles cases were reported each year in
the United States (6). However, since virtually all children acquired measles, the true number of cases
probably exceeded 4 million per year (i.e., the entire birth cohort). Since 1963, when both an
inactivated and a live attenuated vaccine (Edmonston B strain) were licensed for use in the United
States, both the type of measles vaccine and the recommended age for measles vaccination have
changed several times. After 1967 and 1975, the inactivated and the Edmonston B vaccine, respec-
tively, were no longer distributed. A live, further attenuated vaccine (Schwarz strain) was first
introduced in 1965, and a similar vaccine (Moraten strain) was licensed in 1968. These further
attenuated vaccines cause fewer reactions than the Edmonston B vaccine, yet are equally effective. The
Moraten vaccine is the vaccine used currently in the United States.
A single dose of live measles vaccine had been recommended since measles vaccine was first
licensed (1). In 1963, the recommended age for vaccination was 9 months, but in 1965 it was changed
to 12 months, and in 1976 it was changed to 15 months because of evidence demonstrating greater
efficacy when children were vaccinated at these ages. Persons vaccinated before the first birthday
needed to be revaccinated.
MEASLES EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ELIMINATION EFFORTS
Since vaccine licensure in 1963, the collaborative efforts of professional and voluntary medical and
public health organizations in vaccination programs have resulted in a 99% reduction in the reported
incidence of measles. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the number of reported cases decreased
to between 22,000 and 75,000 cases per year. Although incidence fell dramatically in all age groups,
children <10 years of age showed the greatest decline, while oider children had a slightly less dramatic
decrease. As a result, the proportion of total cases occurring in different age groups changed. From
1984 to 1988, 58% of reported cases affected children >10 years of age, compared with 10% during the
period 1960 to 1964 (6).

In 1978, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare initiated a Measles Elimination Program,
with a goal to eliminate indigenous measles from the United States by October 1, 1982. The three
components of this program have been 1) maintenance of high levels of immunity, 2) careful
surveillance of disease, and 3) aggressive outbreak control. As a result of these efforts, the number of
cases reported annually dropped from 26,871 in 1978 to an all-time low of 1,497 in 1983. The number
of cases reported then increased until 1986 (6,282) cases (7). Reported cases decreased in 1987 and
1988 but rose again during the first 48 weeks of 1989, when more than 14,000 cases were reported.
Measles cases are routinely reported by state and local health departments to the MMWR. The
Division of Immunization, Center for Prevention Services, CDC, collects supplementary data on cases,
including information on vaccination status (i.e., vaccinated or unvaccinated). Persons appropriately
vaccinated for measles are those who have received a dose of live measles vaccine on or after their first
birthday
Unvaccinated persons with measles can be subclassified into three general groups: those for whom
vaccine is not routinely indicated (e.g., those <16 months of age, born before 1957, with prior
physician diagnosis of measles, or with medical contraindications), those for whom vaccination is
difficult to achieve (e.g., non-U.S. citizens and persons exempted for religious or philosophic reasons),
and those for whom vaccine is indicated (e.g., children >16 months of age and children vaccinated
before their first birthdays). From 1985 through 1988, information on vaccination status for 16,819
measles cases was collected by the Division of Immunization. Appropriately vaccinated persons
accounted for 42%, and 92% of cases in this group occurred among persons >5 years of age. In 26%
of these cases, the patients were unvaccinated persons for whom vaccine was not routinely indicated
or for whom vaccination was difficult to achieve. The remaining 32% were unvaccinated persons for
whom vaccine was indicated. Forty-two percent of the persons in this latter group were children 16
months to 4 years of age.
In recent years, two major types of outbreaks have occurred in the United States: those among
unvaccinated preschool-aged children, including those younger than the recommended age for
vaccination (i.e., <15 months), and those among vaccinated school-aged children (8). In addition,
particularly in 1989, a substantial number of cases occurred among students and personnel on college
campuses. Large outbreaks occurred among unvaccinated preschool-aged children in several inner-
city areas. In these outbreaks, of the cases that occurred among vaccine-eligible children 16 months-4
years of age, up to 88% of the children were unvaccinated. As many as 40% of cases occurred among
children <16 months of age. In some of these areas, surveys indicate that 49%-65% of 2-year-olds had
received measles vaccine (9). Among school-aged children, outbreaks have occurred in schools with
vaccination levels of >98%. These outbreaks have occurred in all parts of the country, including areas
that had not reported measles for years.
In general, attack rates in individual schools were low (1%-5%) and the calculated vaccine efficacy
high. Most of the persons with measles in college outbreaks were also likely to have been vaccinated,
although documentation of vaccination was often lacking. However, in many outbreaks, children
vaccinated at 12-14 months of age had higher attack rates than those vaccinated at older ages (10). In
a few outbreaks, older persons vaccinated in the more distant past were at increased risk for disease;
this risk was independent of age at vaccination (11).
The goal of eliminating measles in the United States has not been reached primarily because of 1)
failure to implement the current vaccination strategy, resulting in large numbers of unvaccinated
preschool-age children in some areas, and 2) vaccine failure. A substantial number of cases occur
among persons who previously have been vaccinated. Theoretically, vaccine failures may either be
primary (i.e., an adequate response to vaccination never developed) or secondary (i.e., an adequate
response initially developed, but immunity was lost over time). Some of the reported vaccine failures
may be explained by the fact that a person's records incorrectly indicated appropriate vaccination.
Measles vaccine is at least 95% effective for children vaccinated at 15 months of age. However,
efficacy may be slightly lower for persons vaccinated between 12 and 14 months of age, presumably
because transplacental maternal antibody persists beyond the first birthday in some children and
interferes with the response to vaccination. Also, secondary vaccine failure could occur after successful
vaccination as a result of waning immunity, but the percentage of persons to whom this applies
appears to be small (12,13). Overall, the great majority of vaccinees appear to have long-term and
probably life-long immunity. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to determine the duration of
vaccine-induced immunity.

CHANGES IN MEASLES VACCINATION POLICY
The Committee reviewed current measles epidemiology and the measles elimination strategy and
considered modifications. New recommendations were developed to help achieve the goal of measles
elimination (Tables 1 and 2). A routine two-dose measles vaccination schedule now is recommended.
This schedule is expected to provide protection to most persons who do not respond to their initial
vaccination.
The first dose is recommended at 15 months of age for children in most areas of the country but at
12 months of age for children in some areas with recurrent measles transmission. The second dose is
recommended at the time a child enters school at kindergarten or first grade (see "Vaccine Usage").
Because programs to administer a second dose of measles vaccine at school entry to kindergarten or
first grade will not have an immediate effect on the incidence of measles for school-aged children,
programs also are recommended for outbreak control (see "Outbreak Control") and for the routine
vaccination of students entering college (see "Special Situations”).
When fully implemented, this schedule should lead to the elimination of measles among school-
aged children and college students. It is expected to prevent the 35%-40% of cases affecting persons
>5 years of age who appear to be vaccine failures, and it may indirectly protect unvaccinated persons
since the risk of exposure to measles will decrease. Outbreaks of measles in school settings are likely
to cease, thus avoiding the substantial disruption of routine activities and the high cost of outbreak
control. However, the overall goal of eliminating measles in the United States also requires more
intensive efforts to vaccinate preschool children at the recommended ages, particularly children
residing in inner cities.
All contacts with health-care providers in physicians' offices, clinics, emergency rooms, and
hospitals are opportunities for evaluating the vaccination status of children, both patients and
accompanying siblings, and for offering vaccine to those who need it. Unvaccinated children should
not be rescheduled for vaccination; rather, they should be vaccinated immediately if no contraindica-
tion exists. Particular attention should be paid to offering simultaneous vaccination. No preschool child
who needs MMR should be offered other vaccines without being offered MMR. Special efforts are also
needed to educate and motivate parents to have such children vaccinated.

MEASLES VIRUS VACCINE
Live measles virus vaccine* used in the United States is prepared in chick-embryo-cell culture. It is
available in monovalent (measles only) form and in two combinations: measles-rubella (MR) and
measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines.
Measles vaccine produces an inapparent or mild, noncommunicable infection. Measles antibodies
develop in at least 95% of susceptible children vaccinated at 15 months of age. Although the titers of
vaccine-induced antibodies are lower than those following natural disease, both serologic and
epidemiologic evidence indicate that vaccine-induced protection appears to be long-lasting in most
individuals.
Vaccine Shipment and Storage
The administration of improperly stored vaccine may fail to provide protection against measles.
Although the current measles vaccine may be more thermostable than vaccine produced in the past,
it should be stored at 2-8 C (35.6-46.4 F) or colder during storage. Vaccine must be shipped at 10 C (50
F) or colder and may be shipped on dry ice. It must be protected from light, which may inactivate the
virus. Reconstituted vaccine must be stored in a refrigerator (not frozen) and discarded if not used
within 8 hours.
VACCINE USAGE
General Recommendations
All vaccines containing measles virus are recommended for routine use for children 15 months of
age. Persons born in or after 1957 who lack documentation of measles immunity (see "Measles
Immunity'') are considered susceptible and should be vaccinated if there are no contraindications (see
*Official name: Measles Virus Vaccine, Live Attenuated.
Available in the United States as Attenuvax® (single antigen), M-R-Vax® (measles-rubella) and M-M-R 11® (measles-
mumps-rubella), from the Merck, Sharp and Dohme Co.

as 6 months of age in outbreak area
if cases are occurring in children
<1 year of age.
Outbreaks in institutions: day-care centers,

to measles.
Outbreaks in medical facilities
Revaccination of all medical workers
born in or after 1957 who have direct
patient contact and who do not have
proof of immunity to measles.
Vaccination may also be considered
for workers born before 1957.
Susceptible personnel who have been
exposed should be relieved from
direct patient contact from the 5th
to the 21st day after exposure
(regardless of whether they received
measles vaccine or IG) or, if they
become ill - for 7 days after they
develop rash.
* Mass revaccination of entire populations is not necessary. Revaccination should be limited to
populations at risk, such as students attending institutions where cases occur.
*Children initially vaccinated before the first birthday should be revaccinated at 15 months of
age. A second dose should be administered at the time of school entry or according to local
policy.
Documentation of physician-diagnosed measles disease, serologic evidence of immunity to
measles, or documentation of receipt of two doses of measles vaccine on or after the first
birthday.

## p. 5 (#99) ###############################################

“Precautions and Contraindications''). All vaccinations should be documented in the patient's perma-
nent medical record (14). A parental history of vaccination, by itself, is not considered adequate
documentation. A physician should not provide an immunization record for a patient unless s/he has
administered the vaccine or has seen a record that documents vaccination. Most persons born before
1957 are likely to have been naturally infected with measles virus and generally need not be considered
susceptible; however, vaccination may be offered to these persons if there is reason to believe they
may be susceptible.
Both doses of measles vaccine should be given as combined MMR vaccine when given on or after
the first birthday. The combined vaccine is preferred to assure immunity to all three viruses. Mumps
revaccination is particularly important. Recent studies have shown that mumps can occur in highly
vaccinated populations, resulting in substantial numbers of cases among persons with histories of
prior mumps vaccination. Although rubella vaccine failure has not been a major problem, the potential
consequences of rubella vaccine failure are substantial (i.e., congenital rubella syndrome), and the use
of MMR should provide an additional safeguard against such failures.
The most commonly used laboratory test for assessing immunity to measles has been the
hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. Other more sensitive assays, such as the enzyme immuno-assay
(EIA), are now being used by many laboratories. Persons with measles-specific antibody, detectable by
any test, are considered immune. Routine serologic screening to determine measles immunity is not
generally recommended, although it may be cost-effective in some situations (e.g., large prepaid
medical programs). However, the test may not be widely available, and screening requires that
tracking systems be established to assure that identified susceptibles return for vaccination. In
addition, screening for antibodies for mumps and rubella would further decrease the cost-
effectiveness of this strategy.
Dosage
Two doses of measles vaccine, generally given as MMR, are recommended for all children after the
first birthday. The dose is 0.5 ml and should be given subcutaneously.
Age at Vaccination
Routine childhood immunization schedule for most areas of the United States
The first dose of measles vaccine should be given when children are >15 months of age. The second
dose should routinely be given when children enter kindergarten or first grade (4-6 years of age).
The recommended time for the second dose is based primarily on administrative considerations.
The current childhood immunization schedule recommends other vaccines (diphtheria and tetanus
toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP) and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV]) when children enter school;
therefore, an additional provider visit for the second dose of measles vaccine is not necessary. In
addition, most school authorities have systems at this grade level for identifying and tracking children
with incomplete immunizations.
Because many of the vaccine failures in recent outbreaks of measles have occurred among 10 to
19-year-old children and adolescents, administering the second dose at the time of school entry may
not achieve full impact on the incidence of measles for 5 to 15 years. For the impact to occur more
rapidly, some localities may choose to give students the second dose at an older age (e.g., when they
enter middle school or junior high school). In deciding when to administer the second dose, health
officials should consider how they can best achieve a high vaccination rate since this is essential to
assure maximum impact of a two-dose schedule. Some localities may want to provide a second dose
to multiple age groups from kindergarten through 12th grade to achieve complete immunization of all
school-aged children more rapidly
Children who have received two doses of live measles vaccine on or after the first birthday (at least
1 month apart) do not need an additional dose when they enter school. Children who have no
documentation of live measles vaccination when they enter school should be admitted after the first
dose. A second dose should be given according to local policy, but no less than 1 month later.
Routine childhood immunization schedule for areas with recurrent measles transmission
Initial vaccination with MMR at 12 months of age is recommended for children living in high-risk
areas. This strategy assumes that the benefit of preventing measles cases between 12 and 15 months
of age outweighs the slightly lower efficacy of the vaccine when given at this age. A high-risk area is
5


## p. 6 (#100) ##############################################

defined as: 1) a county with more than five cases among preschool-aged children during each of the
last 5 years, 2) a county with a recent outbreak among unvaccinated preschool-aged children, or 3) a
county with a large inner-city urban population. These recommendations may be implemented for an
entire county or only in defined high-risk areas.
Revaccination of Persons Vaccinated According to Earlier Recommendations
Previous vaccination with live vaccine
Persons vaccinated with live measles vaccine before their first birthday should be considered
unvaccinated. If they are entering kindergarten or first grade, college or other post-high school
educational institutions (see "Special Situations”), or beginning employment in a medical facility (see
“Special Situations') and cannot provide documentation of immunity to measles (see "Measles
Immunity''), they should receive two doses of vaccine no less than 1 month apart.
Live attenuated Edmonston B vaccine (distributed from 1963-1975) was usually administered with
immune globulin (IG) or high-titer measles immune globulin (MIG; no longer available in the United
States). This vaccine, administered on or after the first birthday, is acceptable as an effective first dose
of vaccine. A second dose should be administered as recommended above. However, if a further
attenuated measles vaccine (i.e., Schwarz or Moraten) was given simultaneously with IG or MIG, the
IG or MIG may have impaired the immune response to vaccination. Persons who received measles
vaccine of unknown type or further attenuated measles vaccine accompanied by IG or MIG should be
considered unvaccinated and should be given two doses of vaccine as outlined above.
Previous vaccination with inactivated vaccine or vaccine of unknown type
Inactivated (killed) measles vaccine was available in the United States only from 1963 to 1967 but
was available through the early 1970s in some other countries. It was frequently given as a series of
two or three injections. Some persons who received inactivated vaccine are at risk of developing
severe atypical measles syndrome when exposed to the natural virus (15). Consequently, such
persons should receive two doses of live vaccine separated by no less than 1 month. Persons
vaccinated with inactivated vaccine followed within 3 months by live vaccine should be revaccinated
with two doses of live vaccine. Revaccination is particularly important when the risk of exposure to
natural measles virus is increased, as may occur during international travel.
A wide range (4%-55%) of recipients of inactivated measles vaccine who were later revaccinated
with live measles vaccine have had reactions to the live vaccine (16). Most of these reactions have
been mild, consisting of local swelling and erythema, with or without low-grade fever lasting 1-2 days.
Rarely, more severe reactions, including prolonged high fevers and extensive local reactions, have
been reported. However, recipients of inactivated measles vaccine are more likely to have serious
illness when exposed to natural measles than when given live measles virus vaccine.
These same recommendations for revaccination apply to persons vaccinated between 1963 and
1967 with vaccine of unknown type, since they may have received inactivated vaccine. Since
inactivated measles vaccine was not distributed in the United States after 1967, persons vaccinated
after 1967 with a vaccine of unknown type need not be revaccinated routinely unless the original
vaccination occurred before the first birthday or was accompanied by IG or MIG. However, such
persons should receive a second dose if they are entering college, beginning employment in medical
facilities, or planning international travel.
Measles Immunity
Persons are considered immune to measles if they 1) were born before 1957, 2) have documentation
of physician-diagnosed measles, 3) have laboratory evidence of immunity to measles, or 4) have
documentation of adequate vaccination. Eventually, adequate vaccination will be defined as receipt of
one dose of live measles vaccine on or after the first birthday for children before they enter school and
two doses of measles vaccine on or after the first birthday for children who are entering or have
entered school.
For localities implementing the second dose for students at ages beyond school entry (e.g., entry to
middle school or junior high school), acceptable evidence of immunity will be one dose at school entry
and two doses for students older than the routine age of the second dose (see "Age at Vaccination").
Since most areas will implement the two-dose schedule one age group at a time, criteria for
adequate vaccination will vary in the interim. For example, if the two-dose schedule is implemented in
6


## p. 7 (#101) ##############################################

1990, children in kindergarten or first grade will need to have documentation of two doses of measles
vaccine after the first birthday to be considered adequately vaccinated. However, a single dose of
vaccine will be acceptable evidence of adequate vaccination for children in higher grades. Two years
later, children in kindergarten through second or third grade will need two doses of measles vaccine
for acceptable evidence of adequate vaccination. Similar criteria would apply if the second-dose
strategy is implemented at an older age (see "Age at Vaccination”).
The interim vaccination criteria for adequate measles vaccination noted above apply to routine
settings only. During outbreaks, all persons at risk and born in or after 1957 who are in kindergarten,
first grade, or beyond will need two doses on or after the first birthday as evidence of adequate
vaccination (see "Outbreak Control").
Individuals Exposed to Disease
Use of vaccine
Exposure to measles is not a contraindication to vaccination. If live measles vaccine is given within
72 hours of measles exposure, it may provide some protection. This approach is preferable to using IG
for persons >12 months of age. If the exposure does not result in infection, vaccination should induce
protection against subsequent measles infection.
Use of IG
IG can prevent or modify measles in a susceptible person if given within 6 days of exposure. The
recommended dose of IG is 0.25 ml/kg (0.11 ml/lb) of body weight (maximum dose = 15 ml). IG may
be especially indicated for susceptible household contacts of measles patients, particularly contacts <1
year of age, pregnant women, or immunocompromised persons, for whom the risk of complications
is increased. The recommended dose of IG for immunocompromised persons is 0.5 ml/kg of body
weight (maximum dose = 15 ml). Live measles vaccine should be given 3 months later (when
passively acquired measles antibodies should have disappeared) if the individual is then at least 15
months old. IG should not be used to control measles outbreaks.
Special Situations
Recommendations for colleges and other institutions
Colleges, technical schools, and other institutions for post-high school education should require
documentation of two doses of live measles-containing vaccines, documentation of prior physician-
diagnosed measles disease, or laboratory evidence of measles immunity before entry for all students
born in or after 1957. Students who have no documentation of live measles vaccination or other
evidence of measles immunity at the time of school entry should be admitted after receiving the first
dose. A second dose should be given no less than 1 month later. Institutions may wish to extend this
requirement to all classes.
Recommendations for medical facilities
Medical personnel are at higher risk for acquiring measles than the general population (17).
Hospitals should require evidence of two live measles vaccinations, documentation of physician-
diagnosed measles disease, or laboratory evidence of measles immunity for medical staff beginning
employment who will have direct patient contact. Persons born in or after 1957 who have no
documentation of vaccination or other evidence of measles immunity should be vaccinated at the time
of employment and revaccinated no less than 1 month later. If resources are available, institutions may
wish to extend this recommendation to all medical personnel, not just those beginning employment.
Since some medical personnel who have acquired measles in medical facilities were born before 1957,
institutions may consider requiring at least one dose of measles vaccine for older employees who are
at risk of occupational exposure to measles.
Recommendations for international travel
Persons traveling abroad should be immune to measles. The protection of young adults who have
escaped measles disease and have not been vaccinated is especially important. Consideration should
be given to providing a dose of measles vaccine to persons born in or after 1957 who travel abroad,
who have not previously received two doses of measles vaccine, and who do not have other evidence
of measles immunity (see “Measles Immunity'').
7


## p. 8 (#102) ##############################################

The age for measles vaccination should be lowered for children traveling to areas in which measles
is endemic or epidemic. Children 12-14 months of age should receive MMR vaccine before their
departure. Children 6-11 months of age should receive a dose of monovalent measles vaccine before
departure, although there is no specific contraindication to the use of MMR for this age group if
monovalent measles vaccine is not available. Seroconversion rates observed for measles, mumps, and
rubella antigens are significantly less among children vaccinated before the first birthday than among
older children. Children who receive monovalent measles vaccine or MMR before their first birthday
should be considered unvaccinated and should receive two doses of MMR at later ages. Whereas the
optimal age for the first revaccination dose is 15 months, the age for revaccination may be as low as
12 months if the child remains in a high-risk area (see "Routine childhood immunization schedule for
areas with recurrent measles transmission''). The second revaccination dose would normally be given
when a child enters school or according to local policy.
Since virtually all infants <6 months of age will be protected by maternally derived antibodies, no
additional protection against measles is necessary in this age group.
SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS
More than 170 million doses of measles vaccine were distributed in the United States from 1963
through 1988. The vaccine has an excellent record of safety. From 5%-15% of vaccinees may develop
a temperature of >103 F (239.4 C) beginning 5-12 days after vaccination and usually lasting several
days ( 18 ). Most persons with fever are otherwise asymptomatic. Transient rashes have been reported
for approximately 5% of vaccinees. Central nervous system conditions, including encephalitis and
encephalopathy, have been reported with a frequency of less than one per million doses administered.
The incidence of encephalitis or encephalopathy after measles vaccination of healthy children is lower
than the observed incidence of encephalitis of unknown etiology. This finding suggests that the
reported severe neurologic disorders temporally associated with measles vaccination were not caused
by the vaccine. These adverse events should be anticipated only in susceptible vaccinees and do not
appear to be age-related. After revaccination, reactions should be expected to occur only among the
small proportion of persons who failed to respond to the first dose.
Personal and Family History of Convulsions
As with the administration of any agent that can produce fever, some children may have a febrile
seizure. Although children with a personal or family history of seizures are at increased risk for
developing idiopathic epilepsy, febrile seizures following vaccinations do not in themselves increase
the probability of subsequent epilepsy or other neurologic disorders. Most convulsions following
measles vaccination are simple febrile seizures, and they affect children without known risk factors.
An increased risk of these convulsions may occur among children with a prior history of convulsions
or those with a history of convulsions in first-degree family members (i.e., siblings or parents) (19).
Although the precise risk cannot be determined, it appears to be low.
In developing vaccination recommendations for these children, the Committee considered a number
of factors, including risks from measles disease, the large proportion (5%-7%) of children with a
personal or family history of convulsions, and the fact that convulsions following measles vaccine are
uncommon and have not been associated with permanent brain damage. The Committee concluded
that the benefits of vaccinating these children greatly outweigh the risks. They should be vaccinated
just as children without such histories.
Because the period for developing vaccine-induced fever occurs approximately 5-12 days after
vaccination, prevention of febrile seizures is difficult. Prophylaxis with antipyretics is one alternative,
but these agents may not be effective if given after the onset of fever. They would have to be initiated
before the expected onset of fever and continued for 5-7 days. However, parents should be alert to the
occurrence of fever after vaccination and should treat their children appropriately.
Children who are being treated with anticonvulsants should continue to take them after measles
vaccination. Because protective levels of most currently available anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., phe-
nobarbitol) are not achieved for some time after therapy is initiated, prophylactic use of these drugs
does not seem feasible.
The parents of children who have either a personal or family history of seizures should be advised
of the small increased risk of seizures following measles vaccination. In particular, they should be told
8


## p. 9 (#103) ##############################################

in advance what to do in the unlikely event that a seizure occurs. The permanent medical record should
document that the small risk of postimmunization seizures and the benefits of vaccination have been
discussed.
Revaccination Risks
There is no evidence of increased risk from live measles vaccination in persons who are already
immune to measles, as a result of either previous vaccination or natural disease.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
Pregnancy
Live measles vaccine, when given as a component of MR or MMR, should not be given to women
known to be pregnant or who are considering becoming pregnant within the next 3 months. Women
who are given monovalent measles vaccine should not become pregnant for at least 30 days after
vaccination. This precaution is based on the theoretical risk of fetal infection, although no evidence
substantiates this theoretical risk. Considering the importance of protecting adolescents and young
adults against measles, asking women if they are pregnant, excluding those who are, and explaining
the theoretical risks to the others before vaccination are sufficient precautions.
Febrile Illness
The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of a current or recent febrile illness depends
largely on the cause of the illness and the severity of symptoms. Minor illnesses, such as a mild
upper-respiratory infection with or without low-grade fever, are not contraindications for vaccination.
For persons whose compliance with medical care cannot be assured, every opportunity should be
taken to provide appropriate vaccinations.
Children with moderate or severe febrile illnesses can be vaccinated as soon as they have recovered.
This wait avoids superimposing adverse effects of vaccination on the underlying illness or mistakenly
attributing a manifestation of the underlying illness to the vaccine. Performing routine physical
examinations or measuring temperatures are not prerequisites for vaccinating infants and children
who appear to be in good health. Asking the parent or guardian if the child is ill, postponing
vaccination for children with moderate or severe febrile illnesses, and vaccinating those without
contraindications are appropriate procedures in childhood immunization programs.
Allergies
Hypersensitivity reactions following the administration of live measles vaccine are rare. Most of
these reactions are minor and consist of a wheal and flare or urticaria at the injection site. More than
170 million doses of measles vaccine have been distributed in the United States, but only five reported
cases of immediate allergic reactions have occurred among children who had histories of anaphylactic
reactions to egg ingestion. These reactions could potentially have been life threatening. Four children
experienced difficulty in breathing, and one of these four had hypotension. Persons with a history of
anaphylactic reactions (hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty in breathing, hypotension,
and shock) following egg ingestion should be vaccinated only with extreme caution. Protocols have
been developed for vaccinating such persons (20,21). However, persons are not at increased risk if
they have egg allergies that are not anaphylactic in nature; they can be vaccinated in the usual manner.
Persons with allergies only to chickens or feathers are not at increased risk of reaction to measles
vaccination.
MMR vaccine and its component vaccines contain trace amounts of neomycin. Although the amount
present is less than that usually used for a skin test to determine hypersensitivity, persons who have
experienced anaphylactic reactions to neomycin should not be given these vaccines. Most often,
neomycin allergy is manifested by contact dermatitis rather than anaphylaxis. A history of contact
dermatitis to neomycin is not a contraindication to receiving measles vaccine. Live measles virus
vaccine does not contain penicillin.
9


## p. 10 (#104) #############################################

Recent Administration of IG
Vaccine virus replication and stimulation of immunity usually occurs 1-2 weeks after vaccination.
When the live measles vaccine is given after IG or specific IG preparations, the vaccine virus might not
replicate successfully, and the antibody response could be diminished. Measles vaccine should not be
given for at least 6 weeks, and preferably for 3 months, after a person has been given IG, whole blood,
or other antibody-containing blood products. If vaccine is given to a person who has received such
products within the preceding 3 months, the dose should not be counted and the person should be
revaccinated approximately 3 months later unless serologic testing indicates that measles-specific
antibodies have been produced. For international travelers, measles vaccination should precede the
administration of IG by at least 2 weeks to preclude interference with replication of the vaccine virus.
If the interval between measles vaccination and subsequent administration of an IG preparation is <14
days, vaccination should be repeated 3 months later, unless serologic testing indicates that antibodies
were produced.
Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis may be exacerbated by natural measles infection. Live measles virus vaccine has not
been shown to have such an effect. Tuberculin skin testing is not a prerequisite for measles
vaccination. If tuberculin testing is needed for other reasons, it can be done the day of vaccination.
Otherwise, the test should be postponed for 4-6 weeks, since measles vaccination may temporarily
suppress tuberculin reactivity.
Altered Immunocompetence
Replication of vaccine viruses can be enhanced in persons with immune-deficiency diseases and in
persons with immunosuppression, as occurs with leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or
therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large doses of corticosteroids. For this
reason, patients with such conditions or therapies (except patients with symptomatic infection with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); see below) should not be given live measles virus vaccine.
Patients with leukemia in remission who have not received chemotherapy for at least 3 months may
receive live-virus vaccines. Short-term (<2 weeks), low- to moderate-dose systemic corticosteroid
therapy, topical steroid therapy (e.g., nasal, skin), long-term alternate-day treatment with low to
moderate doses of short-acting systemic steroids, and intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injection of
corticosteroids are not immunosuppressive in their usual doses and do not contraindicate the
administration of measles vaccine.
The growing number of infants and preschoolers with HIV infection has directed special attention to
the appropriate immunization of such children. Asymptomatic children do not need to be evaluated
and tested for HIV infection before decisions concerning vaccination are made. Asymptomatic
HIV-infected persons in need of MMR should receive it. MMR should be considered for all symptomatic
HIV-infected children, including children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), since
measles disease in these children can be severe. Limited data on MMR vaccination among both
asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV-infected children indicate that MMR has not been associated with
severe or unusual adverse events, although antibody responses have been unpredictable (22-24).
The administration of high-dose intravenous immune globulin (GIV) at regular intervals to
HIV-infected children is being studied to determine whether it will prevent a variety of infections. MMR
vaccine may be ineffective if it is administered to a child who has received IGIV during the preceding
3 months.
Management of Patients with Contraindications to Measles Vaccine
If immediate protection against measles is required for persons with contraindications to measles
vaccination, passive immunization with IG, 0.25 ml/kg (0.11 ml/lb) of body weight (maximum dose
15 ml), should be given as soon as possible after known exposure. Exposed symptomatic HIV-infected
and other immunocompromised persons should receive IG regardless of their previous vaccination
status; however, IG in usual doses may not be effective in such patients. For immunocompromised
persons, the recommended dose is 0.5 ml/kg of body weight if IG is administered intramuscularly
(maximum dose 15 ml). This corresponds to a dose of protein of approximately 82.5 mg/kg
(maximum dose 2,475 mg). Intramuscular IG may not be needed if a patient with HIV infection is
receiving 100-400 mg/kg IGIV at regular intervals and the last dose was given within 3 weeks of
=

exposure to measles. Because the amounts of protein administered are similar, high-dose IGIV may be
as effective as IG given intramuscularly. However, no data are available concerning the effectiveness
of IGIV in preventing measles.
Simultaneous Administration of Vaccines
In general, simultaneous administration of the most widely used live and inactivated vaccines does
not impair antibody responses or increase rates of adverse reactions (25). The administration of MMR
vaccine yields results similar to the administration of individual measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines
at different sites or at different times.
There are equivalent antibody responses and no clinically significant increases in the frequency of
adverse events when DTP, MMR, and OPV or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) are administered
either simultaneously at different sites or at separate times. Routine simultaneous administration of
MMR, DTP, and OPV (or IPV) is recommended for all children >15 months of age who are eligible to
receive these vaccines . Vaccination with MMR at 15 months followed by DTP, OPV (or IPV), and
Haemophilus influenzae b conjugate vaccine (HbCV) at 18 months remains an acceptable alternative
for children with caregivers known to be generally compliant with other health-care recommendations.
No data are available on the concomitant administration of HbCV or H. influenzae b polysaccharide
vaccine (HbPV) and OPV and MMR vaccine. If the child might not be brought back for future
vaccinations, the simultaneous administration of all vaccines (including DTP, OPV, MMR, and HbCV or
HbPV) is recommended, as appropriate to the recipient's age and previous vaccination status.
OUTBREAK CONTROL
All reports of suspected measles cases should be investigated promptly. A measles outbreak exists
in a community whenever one case of measles is confirmed. Once this occurs, preventing the
dissemination of measles depends on the prompt vaccination of susceptible persons. Control activities
should not be delayed for laboratory results on suspected cases. Persons who cannot readily provide
documentation of measles immunity (see "Measles Immunity'') should be vaccinated or excluded
from the setting (e.g., school). Documentation of vaccination is adequate only if the date of vaccination
is provided. Almost all persons who are excluded from an outbreak area because they lack
documentation of immunity quickly comply with vaccination requirements. Persons who have been
exempted from measles vaccination for medical, religious, or other reasons should be excluded from
the outbreak area until at least 2 weeks after the onset of rash in the last case of measles.
School-based Outbreaks
During outbreaks in day-care centers; elementary, middle, junior, and senior high schools; and
colleges and other institutions of higher education, a program of revaccination with MMR vaccine is
recommended in the affected schools. Consideration should be given to revaccination in unaffected
schools that may be at risk of measles transmission. Revaccination should include all students and
their siblings and all school personnel born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentation that
they received two doses of measles-containing vaccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence
of measles immunity (see “Measles Immunity''). Persons revaccinated, as well as unvaccinated
persons receiving their first dose as part of the outbreak control program, may be immediately
readmitted to school. Mass revaccination of entire communities is not necessary.
Quarantine
Imposing quarantine measures for outbreak control is both difficult and disruptive to schools and
other organizations. Under special circumstances restriction of an event might be warranted; however,
such action is not recommended as a routine measure for outbreak control.
Outbreaks Among Preschool-aged Children
The risk of complications from measles is high among infants <1 year of age. Therefore, considering
the benefits and risks, vaccination with monovalent measles vaccine is recommended for infants as
young as 6 months of age when exposure to natural measles is considered likely. MMR may be
administered to children before the first birthday if monovalent measles vaccine is not readily
-
11


## p. 12 (#106) #############################################

available. Children vaccinated before the first birthday should be revaccinated when they are 15
months old and when they enter school to ensure adequate protection (see "General Recommenda-
tions'').
Medical Settings
If an outbreak occurs in the areas served by a hospital or within a hospital, all employees with direct
patient contact who were born in or after 1957 who cannot provide documentation they they received
two doses of measles vaccine on or after their first birthday or other evidence of immunity to measles
(see "Measles Immunity'') should receive a dose of measles vaccine. Since some medical personnel
who have acquired measles in medical facilities were born before 1957, vaccination of older employees
who may have occupational exposure to measles should also be considered during outbreaks.
Susceptible personnel who have been exposed should be relieved from direct patient contact from the
fifth to the 21st day after exposure regardless of whether they received vaccine or IG after the
exposure. Personnel who become ill should be relieved from patient contact for 7 days after they
develop rash.
DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS
Disease Surveillance
As the incidence of measles declines in the United States, aggressive surveillance becomes
increasingly important. Effective surveillance can delineate inadequate levels of protection, define
groups needing special attention, and assess the effectiveness of control activities.
Known or suspected measles cases should be reported immediately to local health departments.
Serologic confirmation should be attempted for every suspected case of measles that cannot be linked
to a confirmed case. Reporting of suspected cases and implementation of outbreak-control activities
should not be delayed pending laboratory results.
The traditional serologic diagnosis of measles requires a significant rise in antibody titer between
acute- and convalescent-phase sera. However, the diagnosis can also be made by demonstrating the
presence of IgM antibody in a single specimen. Correct interpretation of serologic data depends upon
the proper timing of specimen collection in relation to rash onset. This timing is especially important
for interpreting negative IgM results, since IgM antibody peaks approximately 10 days after rash onset
and is usually undetectable 30 days after rash onset.
Asymptomatic reinfection can occur in persons who have previously developed antibodies, whether
from vaccination or from natural disease. Symptomatic reinfections are rare. These reinfections have
been accompanied by rises in measles antibody titers.
Reporting of Adverse Events
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires physicians and other health care
providers who administer vaccines to maintain permanent immunization records and to report
occurrences of adverse events specified in the Act (14). These adverse events, as well as other adverse
events that require medical attention, must be reported to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. Although there eventually will be one system for reporting adverse events following
immunizations, two separate systems currently exist. The appropriate reporting method depends on
the source of funding used to purchase the vaccine. If a vaccine was purchased with public funds,
adverse events should be reported to the appropriate local, county, or state health department. The
state health department submits its report to CDC. If vaccine was purchased with private money,
adverse events should be reported directly to the Food and Drug Administration.

Recommendation of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
Poliomyelitis Prevention
This revised ACIP recommendation on poliomyelitis prevention addresses issues important poliomyelitis
control in the United States today. Specifically, situations that constitute increased risk are defined, and alterna-
tives for protection are outlined. Recommendations for immunization of adults are presented, clarifying the role
of inactivated polio vaccine in immunizing adults. These recommendations also address the problems of inter-
rupted immunization schedules and completion of primary immunization. Oral polio vaccine remains the vaccine
of choice for primary immunization of children.
INTRODUCTION
Poliovirus vaccines, used widely since 1955, have dramatically reduced the incidence of poliomyelitis in the
United States. The annual number of reported cases of paralytic disease declined from more than 18,000 in
1954 to an average annual number of less than 13 in 1973-1980. The risk of poliomyelitis is generally very
small in the United States today, but epidemics are likely to occur if the immunity of the population is not main-
tained by immunizing children beginning in the first year of life. Small outbreaks have occurred in 1970, 1972,
and 1979 as a result of introduction of virus into susceptible populations in communities with low immunization
levels.
As a result of the Childhood Immunization Initiative efforts 1977-1979, immunization levels in children are
now higher than ever before. The School Enterer Assessments in kindergarten and first-grade levels have indicat-
ed that the percentage of these children who have completed primary vaccination against poliomyelitis reached
95% in the 1980-1981 school year. Immunization levels in preschool children and in those who are in higher
grades may be substantially lower than the levels at school entry.
Laboratory surveillance of enteroviruses shows that the circulation of wild polioviruses has diminished
markedly. Inapparent infection with wild strains no longer contributes significantly to establishing or maintaining
immunity, making universal vaccination of infants and children even more important.
POLIOVIRUS VACCINES
Two types of poliovirus vaccines are currently licensed in the United States: Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)* and
Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV).
Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV)
Within several years after it was licensed in the United States in 1963, trivalent OPV, the live attenuated vac-
cine combining all 3 strains of poliovirus, almost totally supplanted the individual monovalent OPV antigens used
earlier. Full primary vaccination with OPV will produce long-lasting immunity to all 3 poliovirus types in more than
95% of recipients. Most recipients are protected after a single dose.
OPV consistently induces intestinal immunity that provides resistance to reinfection with polioviruses. Admin-
istration of OPV may interfere with simultaneous infection by wild polioviruses, a property which is of special
value in epidemic-control campaigns. In rare instances (once in approximately 3.2 million doses distributed), OPV
has been associated with paralytic disease in vaccine recipients or their close contacts. In the 12-year period
1969-1980, approximately 290 million doses of OPV were distributed, and 92 cases of paralysis associated
with vaccine were reported. Twenty-five cases of paralysis occurred in otherwise healthy vaccine recipients, 55
cases in healthy close contacts of vaccine recipients, and 12 cases in persons (recipients or contacts) with
immune-deficiency conditions.
Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV)
Licensed in 1955, IPV has been used extensively in this country and many other parts of the world. It is given
by subcutaneous injection. Where extensively used, IPV has brought about a great reduction in paralytic poli-
omyelitis cases. Approximately 428 million doses have been administered in the United States, mostly before

1962. Although IPV has not been widely used in this country for more than a decade, a Canadian product
licensed for use in the United States is now available.
It is generally accepted that primary vaccination with 4 doses of IPV produces immunity to all 3 poliovirus
types in more than 95% of recipients. Additional experience with the IPV product available since 1968 is neces-
sary to establish whether the duration of immunity is comparable to that induced by OPV. Experience in other
countries forms the basis for the present recommendations on booster doses.
There is considerable evidence from epidemiologic studies that immunizing with IPV diminishes circulation of
wild poliovirus in the community, although it is known that persons vaccinated with IPV can subsequently be in-
fected with and excrete in feces either wild strains or attenuated vaccine virus strains. No paralytic reactions to
IPV are known to have occurred since the 1955 cluster of poliomyelitis cases caused by vaccine that contained
live polioviruses that had escaped inactivation. Serious adverse reactions are not anticipated with the current IPV
product.
An improved IPV product with higher potency has been developed in Europe. Studies in Africa and Europe
have revealed essentially 100% seroconversion following 2 doses. Duration of protection is under study. Prelimi-
nary studies are now under way in a U.S. population to compare this product with OPV.
ROUTINE IMMUNIZATION
Rationale for Choice of Vaccine
Although IPV and OPV are both effective in preventing poliomyelitis, OPV is the vaccine of choice for primary
immunization of children in the United States when the benefits and risks for the entire population are
considered. OPV is preferred because it induces intestinal immunity, is simple to administer, is well accepted by
patients, results in immunization of some contacts of vaccinated persons, and has a record of having essentially
eliminated disease associated with wild polioviruses in this country. The choice of OPV as the preferred polio
vaccine in the United States has also been made by the Committee on Infectious Diseases of the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics (1) and a special expert committee of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences
(2).
Some poliomyelitis experts contend that greater use of IPV in the United States for routine vaccination would
provide continued control of naturally occurring poliovirus infections and simultaneously reduce the problem of
OPV-associated disease. They argue that there is no substantial evidence that OPV and currently available IPV
differ in their ability to protect individuals from disease. They question the public health significance of higher
levels of gastrointestinal immunity achieved with OPV, and they question whether the transmission of vaccine
virus to close contacts contributes substantially to the level of immunity achieved in the community.
Some countries successfully prevent poliomyelitis with IPV. However, because of many differences between
these countries and the United States, particularly with respect to risks of exposure to wild polioviruses and the
ability to achieve and maintain very high vaccination rates in the population, their experiences with IPV may not
be directly applicable here.
Prospective vaccinees or their parents should be made aware of the polio vaccines available and the reasons
why recommendations are made for giving specific vaccines at particular ages and under certain circumstances.
Furthermore, the benefits and risks of the vaccines for individuals and the community should be stated so that
vaccination is carried out among persons who are fully informed.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INFANTS, CHILDREN, AND ADOLESCENTS
Primary Immunization (Table 1)
OPV: For infants, children, and adolescents through secondary school age (generally up to age 18) the pri-
mary series of OPV consists of 3 doses. In infancy the primary series is integrated with DTP vaccination, and the
first dose is commonly given at 6-12 weeks of age. At all ages the first 2 doses should be separated by at least
6, and preferably 8, weeks. The third dose is given at least 6 weeks, customarily 8-12 months, after the second
dose. In high-risk areas, an additional dose of OPV is often given within the first 6 months of life. Breast feeding
does not interfere with successful immunization.
IPV: The primary series consists of 4 doses of vaccine; volume and route of injection are specified by the
manufacturer. In infancy, the primary schedule is usually integrated with DTP vaccination, as with OPV. Three
doses can be given at 4-to 8-week intervals; the fourth dose should follow 6-12 months after the third.
All children should complete primary immunization before entering school, preferably with all OPV or all IPV.
If, however, a combination of IPV and OPV is used, a total of 4 doses constitutes a primary series.
Supplementary Immunization
OPV: Before entering school, all children who previously received primary immunization with OPV (3 doses)
in early childhood should be given a fourth dose. However, if the third primary dose is administered on or after
2


## p. 3 (#111) ##############################################

the fourth birthday, a fourth (supplementary) dose is not required. The additional dose will increase the likelihood
of complete immunity in the small percentage of children who have not previously developed serum antibodies
to all 3 types of polioviruses. The need for supplementary doses after 4 doses of OPV has not been established,
but children considered to be at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus (as noted below under RECOMMENDA-
TIONS FOR ADULTS) may be given a single additional dose of OPV.
IPV: Before entering school, all children who previously received primary immunization with either IPV alone
or a combination of IPV and OPV (a total of 4 doses) in early childhood should be given at least 1 dose of OPV or
1 additional dose of IPV. However, if the fourth primary dose is administered on or after the fourth birthday, a
fifth (supplementary) dose is not required at school entry. Use of a primary series of OPV would eliminate the
need for subsequent booster doses of IPV. Children who received primary immunization with IPV should obtain a
booster dose of IPV every 5 years until the age of 18 years, unless a primary series of OPV is given. The need for
such supplementary doses after the 5 basic doses of the currently available IPV product has not been firmly
established. Further experience may lead to alteration of this recommendation.
Children Incompletely Immunized
Polio vaccination status should be reevaluated periodically, and those who are inadequately protected should
complete their immunizations.
OPV: To help assure seroconversion to all 3 serotypes of poliovirus, completion of the primary series of 3
doses of OPV is recommended. Time intervals between doses longer than those recommended for routine pri-
mary immunization do not necessitate additional doses of vaccine. Individuals who received only 1 dose of each
of the monovalent OPVs in the past should receive 2 doses of trivalent OPV at least 6 weeks apart. One dose of
each monovalent OPV (poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3) is at least equivalent to 1 dose of trivalent OPV.
IPV: Regulations for vaccine licensure adopted since 1968 require a higher potency IPV than was previously
manufactured. Four doses of IPV administered after 1968 are considered a complete primary series. As with

OPV, time intervals between doses longer than those recommended for routine primary immunization do not
necessitate additional doses.
Incompletely immunized children who are at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus (as noted below under
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADULTS) should be given the remaining required dose or, if time is a limiting
factor, at least a single dose of OPV.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADULTS
Routine primary poliovirus vaccination of adults (generally those 18 years old or older) residing in the United
States is not necessary. Most adults are already immune and also have a very small risk of exposure to poli-
omyelitis in the United States. Immunization is recommended for certain adults who are at greater risk of expo-
sure to wild polioviruses than the general population, including:
1. travelers to areas or countries where poliomyelitis is epidemic or endemic;
2. members of communities or specific population groups with disease caused by wild polioviruses;
3. laboratory workers handling specimens which may contain polioviruses;
4. health-care workers in close contact with patients who may be excreting polioviruses.
For individuals in the above categories, polio vaccination is recommended as detailed below.
Unvaccinated Adults
For adults at increased risk of exposure to poliomyelitis, primary immunization with IPV is recommended
whenever this is feasible. IPV is preferred because the risk of vaccine-associated paralysis following OPV is
slightly higher in adults than in children. Three doses should be given at intervals of 1-2 months; a fourth dose
should follow 6-12 months after the third.
In circumstances where time will not allow at least 3 doses of IPV to be given before protection is required,
the following alternatives are recommended:
1. If less than 8, but more than 4, weeks are available before protection is needed, 2 doses of IPV should be
given at least 4 weeks apart.
2. If less than 4 weeks are available before protection is needed, a single dose of OPV is recommended.
In both instances, the remaining doses of vaccine should be given later at the recommended intervals, if the
person remains at increased risk.
Incompletely Immunized Adults
Adults who are at increased risk of exposure to poliomyelitis and who have previously received less than a full
primary course of OPV or IPV should be given the remaining required doses of either vaccine, regardless of the
interval since the last dose and the type of vaccine previously received.
Adults Previously Given a Complete Primary Course of OPV or IPV
Adults who are at increased risk of exposure to poliomyelitis and who have previously completed a primary
course of OPV may be given another dose of OPV. The need for further supplementary doses has not been
established. Those adults who previously completed a primary course of IPV may be given a dose of either IPV or
OPV. If IPV is used exclusively, additional doses may be given every 5 years, but their need also has not been
established
UNIMMUNIZED OR INADEQUATELY IMMUNIZED ADULTS IN
HOUSEHOLDS IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE TO BE GIVEN OPV
Adults who have not been adequately immunized against poliomyelitis with OPV or IPV are at a very small risk
of developing OPV-associated paralytic poliomyelitis when children in the household are given OPV. About 4
such cases have occurred annually among contacts since 1969, during which time about 24 million doses of
OPV were distributed yearly. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS.)
Because of the overriding importance of ensuring prompt and complete immunization of the child and the ex-
treme rarity of OPV-associated disease in contacts, the Committee recommends the administration of OPV to a
child regardless of the poliovirus-vaccine status of adult household contacts. This is the usual practice in the
United States. The responsible adult should be informed of the small risk involved. An acceptable alternative, if
there is strong assurance that ultimate, full immunization of the child will not be jeopardized or unduly delayed, is
to immunize adults according to the schedule outlined above before giving OPV to the child.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
Pregnancy
Although there is no convincing evidence documenting adverse effects of either OPV or IPV on the pregnant
woman or developing fetus, it is prudent on theoretical grounds to avoid vaccinating pregnant women. However,
if immediate protection against poliomyelitis is needed, OPV is recommended.
4


## p. 5 (#113) ##############################################

Immunodeficiency
Patients with immune-deficiency diseases, such as combined immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia
and agammaglobulinemia, should not be given OPV because of their substantially increased risk of vaccine-
associated disease. Furthermore, patients with altered immune states due to diseases such as leukemia,
lymphoma, or generalized malignancy, or with immune systems compromised by therapy with corticosteroids,
alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation should not receive OPV because of the theoretical risk of paralytic
disease. OPV should not be used for immunizing immunodeficient patients and their household contacts; IPV is
recommended. Many immunosuppressed patients will be immune to polioviruses by virtue of previous immuniza-
tion or exposure to wild-type virus at a time when they were immunologically competent. Although these per-
sons should not receive OPV, their risk of paralytic disease is thought to be less than that of naturally immuno-
deficient individuals. Although a protective immune response to IPV in the immunodeficient patient cannot be
assured, the vaccine is safe and some protection may result from its administration. If OPV is inadvertently ad-
ministered to a household-type contact of an immunodeficient patient, close contact between the patient and
the recipient of OPV should be avoided for approximately 1 month after vaccination. This is the period of maxi-
mum excretion of vaccine virus. Because of the possibility of immunodeficiency in other children born to a family
in which there has been 1 such case, OPV should not be given to a member of a household in which there is a
family history of immunodeficiency until the immune status of the recipient and other children in the family is
documented.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
OPV
In rare instances, administration of OPV has been associated with paralysis in healthy recipients and their
contacts. Other than efforts to identify persons with immune-deficiency conditions, no procedures are currently
available for identifying persons likely to experience such adverse reactions. Although the risk of vaccine-
associated paralysis is extremely small for vaccinees and their susceptible, close, personal contacts, they should
be informed of this risk.
IPV
No serious side effects of currently available IPV have been documented. Since IPV contains trace amounts o
streptomycin and neomycin, there is a possibility of hypersensitivity reactions in individuals sensitive to these
antibiotics.
CASE INVESTIGATION AND EPIDEMIC CONTROL
Each suspected case of poliomyelitis should prompt an immediate epidemiologic investigation, including an
active search for other cases. If evidence implicates wild poliovirus and there is a possibility of transmission, a
vaccination plan designed to contain spread should be developed. If evidence implicates vaccine-derived
poliovirus, no vaccination plan need be developed, as no outbreaks associated with vaccine virus have been
documented to date. Within an epidemic area, OPV should be provided for all persons over 6 weeks of age who
have not been completely immunized or whose immunization status is unknown, with the exceptions noted
above under Immunodeficiency.

Recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
Poliomyelitis Prevention: Enhanced-Potency Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine
Supplementary Statement
The supplementary statement provides information on and recommendations for the use of
inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) of enhanced potency.* The Immunization Practices Advisory
Committee (ACIP) believes that, in the United States, polio immunization should rely primarily on oral
poliovirus vaccine (OPV), with selected use of enhanced-potency IPV as specified in this document.
However, this subject should be reviewed on a continuing basis, and an extensive review of polio
vaccines and potential vaccine policies will take place during 1988. General recommendations on
poliomyelitis prevention, including the use of and schedules for OPV, are found in the current ACIP
recommendations (1).
Introduction
Conventional IPV. IPV was introduced in the United States in 1955 and was used widely until OPV
became available during the period 1961-1964. Thereafter, the use of IPV rapidly declined to a level of
less than 1% of all polio vaccine distributed annually in the United States.
In recent U.S. studies, three doses of IPV administered in the first year of life produced antibodies
to poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 in 87%, 97%, and 95% of recipients, respectively. More than 99% of
children completing the four-dose primary series by 18 months of age produced antibodies to all three
serotypes (2).
Enhanced-Potency IPV. A method of producing a more potent IPV with greater antigenic content was
developed in 1978 and led to the newly licensed IPV, which is produced in human diploid cells (3).
Results of studies from several countries have indicated that a reduced number of doses of IPV
produced with this technique can immunize children satisfactorily (4-6). A clinical trial of two
preparations of enhanced-potency IPV was completed in the United States in 1984 (7). Children
received three doses of one of the enhanced-potency IPVs at 2, 4, and 18 months of age. In spite of the
presence of maternal antibodies in the majority of the infants at the time of the first dose, 99%-100%
of the children were seropositive for all three poliovirus types at 6 months of age (2 months after their
second dose). The percentage of seropositive children did not rise or fall significantly during the
14-month period following the second dose, a result that confirms that seroconversion had occurred
in almost all children. Furthermore, geometric mean titers increased 5- to 10-fold following both the
second and third doses. Conclusive studies are not yet available concerning antibody persistence
following three doses of the enhanced-potency IPV to be made available in the United States. However,
unpublished studies of an IPV with lower antigen content have shown 100% seropositivity 5 years after
the third dose (2).
The effect of enhanced-potency IPV on the circulation of poliovirus in a community has not yet been
determined, but it is likely to be at least as good as that seen with conventional IPV. In a recent study
of poliovirus excretion following type 1 vaccine-virus challenge after the third dose of enhanced-
potency IPV, the decrease in excretion was at least as great as that after conventional IPV, but still
significantly less than that found after three doses of OPV (8).
Vaccine Usage
Indications. Persons with a congenital immune deficiency disease, such as agammmaglobulinemia;
an acquired immune deficiency disease, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); or an
altered immune status as a result of other diseases or immunosuppressive therapy are at increased
risk for paralysis associated with OPV. Therefore, if polio immunization is indicated, these persons and

Connaught Laboratories Inc. beginning in March 1988.

their household members and other close contacts should receive IPV rather than OPV. Although a
protective immune response following receipt of enhanced-potency IPV cannot be assured, some
protection may be provided to the immunocompromised patient. Available data on children previously
diagnosed with asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection do not suggest that they
are at increased risk of adverse consequences from OPV. However, for such persons, use of IPV rather
than OPV is prudent since family members may be immunocompromised because of AIDS or HIV
infection and may be at increased risk for paralysis from contact with an OPV virus.
Routine primary poliovirus vaccination of adults (generally those 18 years of age or older) residing
in the United States is not recommended. Adults at increased risk of exposure to either vaccine or wild
poliovirus (1) should receive polio vaccination in accordance with the schedule prescribed below.
In households where polio vaccine is to be administered to immunologically normal children, ACI
recommends giving OPV regardless of the poliovirus-vaccine status of adult household contacts ( 1 ).
The overall risk of vaccine-associated paralytic disease in immunologically normal contacts of OPV
recipients is one case per 5.5 million doses of OPV distributed (9). As an alternative, adult contacts can
first complete their primary series of polio vaccine as detailed in the schedule below, if there is strong
assurance that subsequent immunization of the child will not be jeopardized or unduly delayed.
Schedules. The primary series for enhanced-potency IPV consists of three 0.5-ml doses adminis-
tered subcutaneously. The interval between the first two doses should be at least 4 weeks, but
preferably 8 weeks. The third dose should follow in at least 6 months, but preferably nearer to 12
months. A primary series can be started as early as 6 weeks of age, but preferably at 2 months of age.
Although studies have not been conducted, young children should receive the third dose along with
diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccine (DTP) and measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR) at 15 months
of age, if possible.
A primary series of polio vaccine usually consists of enhanced-potency IPV alone or OPV alone.
However, a combination of both vaccines totalling three doses and separated by appropriate intervals
constitutes a primary series. If enhanced-potency IPV is administered to persons with a previously
incomplete series of conventional IPV, a final total of four doses of polio vaccine is necessary for a
primary series.
All children who received a primary series of enhanced-potency IPV or of a combination of polio
vaccines should be given a booster dose before entering school, unless the final dose of the primary
series was administered on or after the fourth birthday. The need for routinely administering additional
doses is unknown at this time.
For unvaccinated adults at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus, a primary series of enhanced-
potency IPV is recommended. While the responses of adults to a primary series have not been studied,
the recommended schedule for adults is two doses given at a 1- to 2-month interval and a third dose
given 6 to 12 months later. If less than 3 months but more than 2 months are available before
protection is needed, three doses of enhanced-potency IPV should be given at least 1 month apart.
Likewise, if only 1 to 2 months are available, two doses of enhanced-potency IPV should be given at
least 1 month apart. If less than 1 month is available, a single dose of either OPV or enhanced-potency
IPV is recommended.
Adults who are at increased risk of exposure and have had 1) at least one dose of OPV, 2) fewer than
three doses of conventional IPV, or 3) a combination of conventional IPV and OPV totalling fewer than
three doses should receive at least one dose of OPV or enhanced-potency IPV. Additional doses
needed to complete a primary series should be given if time permits.
Adults who are at increased risk of exposure and who have previously completed a primary series
with any one or combination of polio vaccines can be given a dose of OPV or enhanced-potency IPV.
Side Effects and Adverse Reactions. Available data indicate that the rate of adverse reactions in the
kidney cells of monkeys receiving enhanced-potency IPV are low and that the reactions are not
different from those following administration of a placebo. The recently licensed human diploid
cell-derived vaccine was not compared to a placebo. Rates of local adverse events following its use are
similar to rates found in controlled studies using vaccine derived from the kidney cells of monkeys.
There is no evidence that conventional IPV causes any serious side effects. Consequently, serious side
effects are not expected to occur with enhanced-potency IPV. This conclusion can be confirmed only
with postmarketing surveillance. Parents of children receiving the vaccine, older vaccine recipients,
and health-care providers are encouraged to report all adverse events occurring within 4 weeks of
receipt of enhanced-potency IPV to the manufacturer and to local or state health departments. The

information will be forwarded to the appropriate federal agency."
Precautions and Contraindications. Vaccine administration should not be postponed because of
minor illnesses, such as mild upper-respiratory infections. Generally, however, persons with severe
febrile illnesses should not be vaccinated until they have recovered.
The enhanced-potency IPV may contain trace amounts of streptomycin and neomycin. Persons who
have had anaphylactic reactions to topically or systemically administered streptomycin and neomycin
should not receive enhanced-potency IPV.
There is no convincing evidence documenting adverse effects of conventional IPV on the pregnant
woman or developing fetus. Data on adverse events following use of enhanced-potency IPV are not
available. On theoretical grounds, it is prudent to avoid vaccinating pregnant women. However, if a
pregnant woman needs immediate protection against poliomyelitis, OPV is recommended.

Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccines for
Prevention of Haemophilus influenzae
Type b Disease Among Infants and Children
Two Months of Age and Older
Recommendations of the Immunization Practices
Advisory Committee (ACIP)
These recommendations include information on use of two vaccines recently licensed for use with
infants: Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Diphtheria CRM 197 Protein Conjugate) (HbOC), manufac-
tured by Praxis Biologics, Inc., and Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Meningococcal Protein
Conjugate) (PRP-OMP), manufactured by Merck Sharp and Dohme, newly licensed for use with infants.
This statement also updates recommendations for use of these and other Haemophilus b conjugate
vaccines with older children and adults.
INTRODUCTION
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is the leading cause of invasive bacterial disease among
children in the United States. Before effective vaccines were introduced, one in 200 children developed
invasive Hib disease by the age of 5 years. Sixty percent of these children had meningitis; 3%-6% died.
Permanent sequelae, ranging from mild hearing loss to mental retardation, affect 20%-30% of all
survivors of meningitis. Ninety-five percent of the cases of invasive H. influenzae disease among
children <5 years of age are caused by organisms with the type b polysaccharide capsule. Approxi-
mately two-thirds of all cases of Hib disease affect infants and children <15 months of age, a group for
which a vaccine has not previously been available (1).
Three Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines are currently licensed for administration to children >15
months of age in the United States. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of
HbOC (October 4, 1990) and PRP-OMP (December 13, 1990) for routine administration to infants
beginning at 2 months of age. This statement a) summarizes available information about Haemophilus
b conjugate vaccines, b) offers guidelines for use of HboC and PRP-OMP for infants for prevention of
Hib disease, and c) advises how to use conjugate vaccines for older children. It should be noted that
HbOC and PRP-OMP have different schedules for administration, which are discussed below.
Immunology of Hib
The polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) capsule of Hib is a major virulence factor for the organism.
Antibody to PRP is the primary contributor to serum bactericidal activity, and increasing levels of
antibody are associated with decreasing risk of invasive Hib disease. The human immune response to
PRP resembles the murine response to T-cell independent antigens: B cells provide the primary
response without a contribution from T-helper cells. In contrast to T-cell dependent antigens, T-cell
independent antigens are characterized by a) induction of a poor antibody response in <18-0 old
infants and children, b) a variable and quantitatively smaller antibody response than that seen with
T-cell dependent antigens, c) production of a higher proportion of immunoglobulin M (IgM), and d)
inability to induce a booster response.
POLYSACCHARIDE VACCINES
Vaccines derived from PRP alone (polysaccharide vaccines) were developed in the 1970s. After
demonstration of safety, immunogenicity, and induction of serum bactericidal activity, an efficacy of


## p. 2 (#122) ##############################################

90% (95% confidence interval [CI] 50%-95%) was shown for one dose of vaccine given to children
18-71 months old in a large trial in Finland. However, the vaccine was ineffective for infants 3-17
months of age (2). Beginning in 1985, several PRP vaccines were licensed for use in the United States
for children >18 months of age, and a series of post-licensure case-control studies demonstrated
variable efficacy. Four of five studies showed efficacy in the range of 41%-88%, and one study showed
no efficacy (3).
CONJUGATE VACCINES
Covalent linkage (conjugation) of PRP with T-cell dependent protein antigens was evaluated in an
attempt to overcome the T-cell independent characteristics of PRP. At present three different
Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines are licensed for use with older children - HbOC, PRP-OMP, and
Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate, Connaught Laboratories, Inc.)
(PRP-D). As noted above, two of these vaccines, HbOC and PRP-OMP, have recently been licensed for
use with 2-month-olds. The conjugate vaccines differ by protein carrier, polysaccharide size, and
method of chemical conjugation, including use of a spacer (a linking moiety) between the PRP and
protein carrier (4) (Table 1).
Immunogenicity
Immunogenicity studies of each of the three conjugate vaccines have been performed among 2- to
6-month-old children. Comparisons of these individual evaluations are difficult, however, because
assays for antibody to PRP are not standardized and study designs differ. Recent studies among
Alaskan Native infants and infants in California, however, suggest that the three conjugate vaccines
induce markedly different immunologic responses (5,6) (Table 2). The immunogenicity of Hboc
among non-Alaskan Natives was not evaluated in these studies. A separate study in which HbOC was
administered to infants and children in New York State and Pennsylvania showed higher immunoge-
nicity than that reported for Alaskan natives; however, the assays were performed in different
laboratories. Studies comparing administration of the three vaccines to 2- to 6-month-old infants in
Nashville also demonstrated substantial differences in immunologic responses (7). The precise level of
antibody required for protection, particularly in the presence of immunologic memory stimulated by
conjugate vaccines, is not known; however, geometric mean titers of 1 ug/mL are considered to be
indicative of long-term protection (8).
Similar comparative data for the different conjugate vaccines among 7- to 14-month-old children are
not available. However, among 432 children who received two doses of Hboc, with the initial dose
given at 7-14 months of age, more than 99% achieved serum antibody levels >1 ug/mL (Praxis
Biologics, Inc., unpublished data). In a separate study among 94 children who received two doses of
PRP-OMP, with the initial dose given at 7-11 months of age, 94% achieved serum antibody levels
>1 ug/mL (9).
Efficacy
Results of efficacy trials among infants are available for the three conjugate vaccines. The first
efficacy trial of an Hib conjugate vaccine among infants was completed in Finland using the PRP-D
vaccine. In a systematic, unblinded trial involving 60,000 infants (30,000 of whom received the vaccine
at 3, 4, and 6 months of age), the point estimate of efficacy was 87% (95% CI 50%-96%) (10). In a

randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 2,102 Alaskan Natives, however, the point
estimate of efficacy was 35% (95% CI = (-57%]-73%) (11). Immunogenicity of the vaccine was limited
in both trials. In the Finnish trial, <40% of infants had attained an antibody level of >1 ug/mL 1 month
after receiving the third of three doses (geometric mean titer (GMT) = 0.42 ug/mL). In Alaska, infants
with a similar vaccination schedule had lower mean titers (GMT = 0.2 ug/mL) 3 months after receiving
the third dose. A subsequent immunogenicity study documented antibody responses that were similar to
those in the Alaskan and Finnish efficacy trials (Table 2).
The reason for the observed differences in efficacy estimates between Alaskan Native and Finnish
infants is unclear. These populations have been observed to have differences in age distribution of Hib
disease as well as differences in other risk factors. For example, in Finland 28% of the reported cases
of Hib disease among <5-year-old children occur before the children are 1 year of age; this percentage
is 64% for Alaskan Natives (12) and 54% for the United States population.
A recent study of HboC vaccine was conducted among 60,000 infants who were enrolled in the
Northern California Kaiser Permanente Health Plan and who were vaccinated at 2, 4, and 6 months of
age. Approximately one-half of these infants received HbOC vaccine. Twelve of the unvaccinated
children and none of the children who had received a full series of vaccine (i.e., three doses)
subsequently had Hib disease, an efficacy of 100% (lower 95% CI = 68%). Three children who had
received one dose of the vaccine and none of the children who had received two doses had Hib disease
(13). Although children were not randomly assigned to vaccine and comparison groups, analysis of the
results suggests that the observed efficacy was not due to lack of comparability between the two
groups.
A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of PRP-OMP vaccine was performed among
Navajo infants vaccinated at 2 and 4 months of age. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated for 3,486 infants
who completed the primary two-dose regimen. Fourteen cases of invasive Hib disease occurred in the
placebo group compared with one case in the vaccine group, an efficacy of 93% (95% CI = 45%-99%)
(M. Santosham, personal communication). Among infants who received only one dose of vaccine or
placebo, eight cases of Hib disease occurred in the placebo group, compared with none in the vaccine
group (p=0.008).
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR VACCINE USE
1. On the basis of the above considerations, the ACIP recommends that all children receive one of
the conjugate vaccines licensed for infant use (HbOC or PRP-OMP), beginning routinely at 2 months
of age (Table 3). Administration of the vaccine series may be initiated as early as age 6 weeks.

2. If HbOC is to be used, previously unvaccinated infants 2-6 months of age should receive three
doses given at least 2 months apart. Unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two
doses of Hboc, given at least 2 months apart, before they are 15 months old (Table 4). Unvaccinated
children 12-14 months of age should receive a single dose of vaccine before they are 15 months of age.
An additional dose of HbOC should be given to all children at 15 months of age, or as soon as possible
thereafter, at an interval not less than 2 months after the previous dose. The other two conjugate
vaccines licensed for use at 15 months of age may be used for this dose, but there are no data
demonstrating that a booster response will occur. An interval as short as 1 month between doses is
acceptable but not optimal.
3. If PRP-OMP is to be used, previously unvaccinated infants 2-6 months of age should receive two
doses 2 months apart and a booster dose at 12 months of age. Children 7-11 months of age not
previously vaccinated should receive two doses 2 months apart and a booster dose at 15 months of
age (or as soon as possible thereafter), not less than 2 months after the previous dose. Children 12-14
months of age not previously vaccinated should receive a single dose and a booster dose at 15 months
of age (or as soon as possible thereafter), not less than 2 months after the previous dose. The other two
conjugate vaccines licensed for use at 15 months of age may be used for this dose, but there are no
data demonstrating that a booster response will occur. An interval as short as 1 month between doses
is acceptable but not optimal.
4. Unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age may be given any one of the three conjugate vaccines
licensed for this age group.
5. Ideally, the same conjugate vaccine should be used throughout the entire vaccination series
(according to the schedule outlined in Table 4). No data exist regarding the interchangeability of
different conjugate vaccines with respect to safety, immunogenicity, or efficacy. However, situations
will arise in which the vaccine provider does not know which type of Hib conjugate vaccine the child
to be vaccinated had previously received. Under these circumstances, it is prudent for vaccine
providers to ensure that at a minimum an infant 2-6 months of age receives a primary series of three
doses of conjugate vaccine. These recommendations may change as data become available regarding
the response to different conjugate vaccines in a primary series.
6. Children <24 months of age who have had invasive Hib disease should still receive vaccine, since
many children of that age fail to develop adequate immunity following natural disease. The vaccine
series can be initiated (or continued) at the time of hospital discharge.
7. Chemoprophylaxis of household or day-care classroom contacts of children with Hib disease
should be directed at both vaccinated and unvaccinated contacts because immune individuals may
asymptomatically carry and transmit the organism. Because of the time required to generate an
immunologic response, vaccination following exposure should not be used to prevent secondary
cases. However, the ACIP strongly supports extensive use of the Hib vaccine for infants attending

day-care facilities; that action should substantially decrease the occurrence of primary cases of Hib
disease in day-care facilities. If every child in a household or day-care classroom has been fully
vaccinated, chemoprophylaxis is unnecessary.
8. Conjugate vaccine may be given simultaneously with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and
pertussis vaccine adsorbed (DTP); combined measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR); oral poliovirus
vaccine (OPV); or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). Any of the vaccines may be injected in the thigh,
and two injections may be given in the same deltoid. All licensed conjugate vaccines should be
administered by the intramuscular route. There are no known contraindications to simultaneous
administration of any Hib conjugate vaccine with either pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccine.
9. No efficacy data are available on which to base a recommendation concerning use of the vaccine
for older children and adults with the chronic conditions associated with an increased risk of Hib
disease. Studies suggest, however, good immunogenicity in patients with sickle cell disease (15),
leukemia (16), patients who have had splenectomies (17) or who have HIV infection (18,19), and
administering vaccine to these patients is not contraindicated.
Side Effects and Adverse Reactions
Reported reactions to the three conjugate vaccines have been mild among both infants and children.
In one study, approximately 300 1- to 6-month-old infants who received HbOC vaccine (without
simultaneous administration of DTP) were evaluated; within 24 hours of injection, no serious side
effects were noted. Following the third dose, 2.2% were noted to have a temperature >38.3 C, 2.2% had
localized redness, 1.1% had swelling, and <1% had warmth ( 14). Adverse events following the first and
second doses were less frequent.
Serious adverse reactions to PRP-OMP also have been rare. Among 4,459 healthy Navajo infants
6-12 weeks of age, no differences were reported in the type and frequency of serious adverse events
among those who received PRP-OMP and those who received placebo. Of the infants in the group who
were 2-14 months of age, 3%-4.3% had a temperature >38.3 C within 48 hours of receiving a second
dose of vaccine, 0.7%-1.2% had erythema of >2.5 cm in diameter, and 0.9%-3.7% had swelling and
induration of >2.5 cm in diameter. Adverse events following the first dose were less frequent.
Precautions and Contraindications
Conjugate vaccines that contain either diphtheria toxoid or protein should not be considered as an
immunizing agent against diphtheria; no changes in the schedule for administering DTP are
recommended. A conjugate vaccine that contains meningococcal protein should not be considered as
an immunizing agent against meningococcal disease.

Recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
Varicella-Zoster Immune Globulin for the Prevention of Chickenpox
This is the first statement by the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) on the use of varicella-
zoster immune globulin (VZIG). Prior recommendations have been made by the manufacturer in cooperation
with the Centers for Disease Control and approved by the Office of Biologics, National Center for Drugs and
Biologics, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Because of exceedingly limited supplies, VZIG use has been
restricted to proven high-risk individuals-for prophylaxis against chickenpox in immunocompromised children
and prevention of postnatal chickenpox following intrauterine exposure. With increasing supplies, some of these
restrictions can be lifted. This statement includes use of VZIG for immunocompromised individuals of any age,
normal adults, pregnant women, and premature and full-term infants. However, because the supply of VZIG is
still limited, it continues to be recommended primarily for immunocompromised children and certain neonates
exposed in utero. It should not be used indiscriminately.
INTRODUCTION
Chickenpox or varicella is usually a benign, highly contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster (V-Z) virus.
The disease occurs primarily among preschool and young, school-aged children. More than 90% of cases are
reported among persons under 15 years of age. Epidemiologic and serologic studies confirm that susceptibility
among adults is substantially lower than among children. Varicella is highly communicable; secondary clinical
attack rates of about 90% follow exposure of household contacts ( 1 ). The period of communicability of patients
with varicella is estimated to range from 1 tº 2 days before rash onset through the first 5-6 days after rash
onset. Persons with progressive varicella may be communicable for longer periods, presumably because their
immune response is to some degree depressed, allowing viral replication to persist.
Because of the large number of varicella cases among normal children, children account for the greatest
number of complications from this disease. However, the risk of complications for normal children is small com-
pared to that for immunocompromised* children, whose varicella can frequently be life-threatening. The risk of
serious morbidity and mortality from varicella is directly related to host immunodeficiency.
Varicella can also be life-threatening to neonates who acquire infection transplacentally just before delivery.
Term infants born to women who had onset of varicella rash within 4 days before delivery appear to have an in-
creased mortality rate from varicella. Infants born to mothers with onsets of varicella rash 5 or more days before
delivery usually have a benign course, presumably because of passive transfer of maternal antibody.
Although intrauterine infection acquired shortly before delivery increases the risk of neonatal complications,
infection of mothers during the first 16 weeks of pregnancy only rarely leads to fetal damage (low birth weight,
hypotrophic limbs, ocular abnormalities, brain damage, and mental retardation). This "syndrome" is so uncom-
mon that two large studies of pregnancies complicated by varicella have not shown an increased incidence rate
of congenital defects compared with controls (2,3). However, review of available case records clearly supports
its existence.
Although few adults are susceptible to varicella, those who develop the disease are more likely to experience
complications. Persons 20 years of age or older account for a disproportionate amount of encephalitis and
death. Although less than 2% of reported cases occur among individuals 20 years of age or older, almost a quar-
ter of all the mortality is reported in this age group. Pneumonia also appears to be more common among adults
with varicella,
Following chickenpox, V-Z virus may persist in latent form without clinical manifestations. Upon reactivation,
the latent virus can cause zoster or "shingles," a painful, vesicular, pustular eruption in the distribution of one or
*Immunocompromised persons include individuals with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency diseases and persons with suppressed immune responses, such
as those that occur with leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, and therapy with immunosuppressive drugs, including steroids, alkylating drugs,
antimetabolites, or radiation.

more sensory-nerve roots. Zoster is more common among the elderly and among immunocompromised
patients, who are also more prone than the general population to develop disseminated zoster with generalized
skin eruptions and central nervous system, pulmonary, hepatic, and pancreatic involvement.
PREVENTION OF VARICELLA BY VARICELLA-ZOSTER IMMUNE GLOBULIN
In 1969, zoster immune globulin (ZIG), prepared from patients convalescing from herpes zoster, was shown
to prevent clinical varicella in susceptible, normal children if administered within 72 hours after exposure. Subse-
quent uncontrolled studies of immunocompromised patients who received ZIG after exposure to V-Z virus
showed that they also tended to have lower-than-expected clinical attack rates and higher-than-expected rates
of subclinical infection when ZIG was administered no later than 96 hours after exposure. Patients who became
ill tended to have modified illnesses with a low complication rate. The efficacy of ZIG in immunocompromised
persons was further demonstrated by a study comparing the use of low-titer versus high-titer lots; patients who
received the high-titer ZIG had significantly lower risks of complications.
In 1978, VZIG became available. Both serologic and clinical evaluations have demonstrated that the product
is equivalent to ZIG in preventing or modifying clinical illness in susceptible, immunocompromised patients ex-
posed to varicella. VZIG has been licensed by FDA's Office of Biologics. VZIG is prepared from plasma found in
routine screening of normal, volunteer blood donors to contain high antibody titers to V-Z. VZIG (Human) is a
sterile, 10%-18% solution of the globulin fraction of human plasma, primarily immunoglobulin G (IgG) in 0.3M
glycine as a stabilizer and 1:10,000 thimerosol as a preservative. It is prepared by Cohn cold ethanol
precipitation
ZIG was in short supply because of the continuous need to find new donors convalescing from herpes zoster.
Because of the method of routinely screening plasma from regular blood donors for high titers of V-Z antibody
and using those units to prepare VZIG, supplies became substantially greater.
INDICATIONS FOR USE
When deciding whether to administer VZIG, the clinician must determine whether the patient is likely to be
susceptible, whether the exposure is likely to result in infection, and whether the patient is at greater risk of
complications from varicella than the general population. Whereas risks of VZIG administration appear to be
negligible, costs of administration can be substantial (approximately $75 per 125 units, or $375 for persons
over 40 kg (88 lbs] of body weight, i.e., for the maximum recommended dose). In addition, it is not known wheth-
er modified infection will lead to lifelong immunity or whether modified infections will increase or decrease the
risk of later developing zoster. The following recommendations are made taking these factors into account. In
some instances, VZIG is routinely recommended; in others, administration should be evaluated on an individual
basis
Determination of Susceptibility
Both normal and immunocompromised adults and children, who are believed to have had varicella based on a
carefully obtained history by an experienced interviewer, can be considered immune $ (Table 1). Reports of
second attacks of clinical varicella are rare.
Since subclinical primary infections appear rare (less than 5% of infections among normal children), children
(under 15 years old) without histories of clinical varicella should be considered susceptible unless proven other-
wise (see below). On the other hand, most normal adults with negative or unknown histories of varicella are
probably immune, since attack rates of varicella in such adults after household or hospital exposure have ranged
from only 5% to 15%.
Antibody Assays: Laboratory determination of susceptibility to varicella is often impractical. The most com-
monly available serologic assay for varicella antibodies, the complement-fixation (CF) test, is insensitive and may
not be specific, particularly at low titers. One year after clinical varicella, approximately two of three patients will
lack detectable CF antibody to varicella.
Other antibody assays are more sensitive and specific indicators of varicella immunity in normal hosts but are
not generally available. These tests include fluorescent antibody against membrane antigen (FAMA), immune ad-
herence hemagglutination (IAHA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and neutralizing antibody. Com-
mercial kits are available that utilize these sensitive antibody detection methods, although they have not been

fully evaluated, particularly in immunocompromised populations." When sensitive tests are available, they can
be used when a determination of susceptibility is necessary.
In some instances, there have been difficulties in interpreting results of some current sensitive antibody
assays in immunocompromised persons. Low levels of such antibodies have been detected in the sera of some
immunocompromised persons iacking histories of chickenpox who subsequently developed clinical varicella.
While present, these antibodies did not prevent illness. Presumably, most if not all these persons had passively
acquired antibodies as a result of recent transfusions of blood, blood derivatives, or blood products containing
antibody. Investigation of other immunocompromised persons has demonstrated that serum antibodies are fre-
quently present following transfusions. In addition, some of these sensitive antibody assays may be measuring
nonspecific activity rather than antibody. Little is known about the cellular immune status of immunocompro-
mised individuals. Therefore, until data are collected that allow further evaluation of serologic tests in the
immunocompromised, in routine circumstances, one may need to rely primarily on a carefully obtained history of
prior clinical chickenpox to define susceptibility. The history should be taken by an experienced interviewer. Addi-
tional studies to evaluate serologic tests of immunocompromised patients are in progress.
In addition, sensitive antibody assays may not be useful in assessing the likelihood that neonates and young in-
fants exposed to varicella will develop clinical disease. Some infants have developed varicella after exposure,
despite the presence of detectable antibody, although in most circumstances, such illnesses have been of modi-
fied severity
Bone Marrow Recipients: Because data correlating a prior history of varicella in the bone marrow donor or
recipient with actual immunity to chickenpox in the recipient are lacking, children or adults who have received
bone marrow transplants should be considered susceptible, regardless of prior histories of clinical chickenpox
either in themselves or in the transplant donor. However, bone marrow recipients who develop varicella or zoster
following transplantation can subsequently be considered immune.
TYPES OF EXPOSURE
Several types of exposure are likely to place a susceptible person at risk for varicella (Table 2); persons con-
tinuously exposed in the household to patients with varicella are at greatest risk. Approximately 90% of such
exposed, susceptible patients contract varicella after a single exposure. Data are not available from immunocom-
promised susceptible populations to directly compare the risk of varicella after playmate or hospital exposure
with the risk after household exposure. However, clinical attack rates among immunocompromised patients

determine susceptibility (i.e., the absence of a history of clinical varicella).

treated with VZIG allow some comparison; approximately one-third to one-half of VZIG-treated immunocom-
promised children with negative histories of prior varicella become ill after household exposure. The risks of dis-
ease following playmate and hospital exposure are approximately one-fifth the risk after household exposure.
Significant playmate contact generally consists of longer than 1 hour of play indoors. Significant exposure for
hospital contacts consists either of sharing the same two- to four-bed hospital room with an infectious patient
or of prolonged, direct face-to-face contact with an infectious person (e.g., nurses or doctors who care for the
patient). Transient contacts (e.g., x-ray technicians and maintenance personnel) are less likely to result in trans-
mission than more prolonged contacts.
The clinical attack rate in VZIG-treated, normal infants who have been exposed in utero shortly before delivery
is as high as 30%-40%, which is not substantially different from reported rates without VZIG. However, compli-
cations are much lower in VZIG-treated infants.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE OF VZIG
Infants and Children
Immunocompromised Children: The most important use of VZIG is for passive immunization of susceptible,
immunocompromised children after significant exposure to chickenpox or zoster (Table 3). This includes children
with primary immune deficiency disorders and neoplastic diseases and children currently receiving immunosup-
pressive treatment.
Newborns of Mothers with Varicella Shortly before Delivery: VZIG is indicated for newborns of mothers
who develop chickenpox within 5 days before and 48 hours after delivery. VZIG is probably not necessary for
newborns whose mothers develop varicella more than 5 days before delivery, since those infants should be pro-
tected from complications of varicella by transplacentally-acquired maternal antibody. There is no evidence to
suggest that infants born to mothers who develop varicella more than 48 hours after delivery are at increased
risk of complications of disease.
Postnatal Exposure of Newborn Infants: Premature infants who have significant postnatal exposure should
be evaluated on an individual basis. Most premature infants of 28 weeks' gestation or more will have

transplacentally-acquired maternal antibodies and are protected from complications of disease if the mother is
immune. The risk of complications of postnatally-acquired varicella in the premature infant is unknown.
However, since their immune systems may be compromised, it seems prudent to administer VZIG to exposed
premature infants whose mothers have negative or uncertain histories of varicella. Such infants should be con-
sidered at risk as long as they require continued hospital care. Exposed infants of less than 28 weeks' gestation
or birth weight of 1,000 g or less probably should receive VZIG regardless of maternal history, because they
may not yet have acquired transplacental maternal antibody.
Normal-term infants who develop varicella following postnatal exposure are not known to be at any greater
risk from complications of chickenpox than older children. VZIG is not recommended for normal-term infants ex-
posed postnatally even if their mothers do not have a prior history of varicella.
Adults
Immunocompromised Adults: The complication rate for immunocompromised adults who contract varicella
is likely to be substantially greater than for normal adults. Most (85%-95%) immunocompromised adults with
negative or unknown histories of prior varicella are likely to be immune. After careful evaluation, adults who are
believed susceptible and who have had significant exposures should receive VZIG to prevent complications.
Normal Adults: Chickenpox can be severe in normal adults. Based on available epidemiologic and clinical
data, normal adults who develop varicella have a ninefold to 25-fold greater risk of complications, including
death, than normal children. The estimated risk of death following varicella in normal adults is 50/100,000, com-
pared with an estimated 2/100,000 among normal children. The decision to administer VZIG to an adult should
be evaluated on an individual basis. Approximately 85%-95% of adults with negative or uncertain histories of
varicella will be immune. The objective is to modify rather than prevent illness in hopes of inducing lifelong
immunity. The clinician should consider the patient's health status, type of exposure, and likelihood of previous
infection when deciding whether to administer VZIG. Adults who are older siblings of large families and adults
whose children have had varicella are probably immune. If sensitive laboratory screening tests for varicella are
available, they might be used to determine susceptibility, if time permits. If, after careful evaluation, a normal
adult with significant exposure to varicella is believed susceptible, VZIG may be administered. However, it should
be noted that VZIG supplies are still limited and that the cost of VZIG is substantial (an adult dose costs $375).
Indiscriminate use of VZIG in normal adults would quickly exhaust supplies and prevent prophylaxis of known
high-risk individuals, such as immunocompromised children and high-risk neonates. Persons in the latter two
groups who develop varicella have estimated death-to-case ratios of at least 7,000/100,000 and
31,000/100,000, respectively, compared with 50/100,000 for normal adults.
Pregnant Women: Pregnant women should be evaluated the same way as other adults. Some experts have
recommended VZIG administration for pregnant women with negative or uncertain prior histories of varicella
who are exposed in the first or second trimester to prevent congenital varicella syndrome or in the third trimester
to prevent neonatal varicella. However, there is no evidence that administration of VZIG to a susceptible, preg-
nant woman will prevent viremia, fetal infection, or congenital varicella syndrome. Because most immunosup-
pressed persons who receive VZIG after a significant exposure develop modified clinical disease or subclinical
infection, it is theoretically possible that VZIG may prevent or suppress clinical disease in the normal mother with-
out preventing fetal infection and disease. In the absence of evidence that VZIG can prevent congenital varicella
syndrome or neonatal varicella, the primary indication for VZIG in pregnant women is to prevent complications of
varicella in a susceptible adult patient rather than to prevent intrauterine infection. Neonates born to mothers
who develop varicella within the 5 days preceding or 48 hours after delivery should receive VZIG regardless of
whether the mother received VZIG.
Hospital Settings
Personnel: After exposure, hospital personnel with negative or uncertain prior histories of chickenpox should
be evaluated in the same manner as other adults. When deciding whether to give VZIG to exposed hospital
personnel, types of exposure and histories of prior exposure to patients with varicella should be taken into
account. If available, sensitive laboratory tests for determining susceptibility can be used to assess candidacy for
VZIG and whether work restrictions are necessary during the incubation period.
Hospital Management of Varicella
Ideally, health-care personnel caring for patients with chickenpox or zoster should be immune to varicella.
Proper control measures to prevent or control varicella outbreaks in hospitals should include strict isolation
precautions, tt cohorting of exposed patients, $$ early discharge when possible, and the use of immune staff. If
++ Whenever possible, patients should be in a negative-pressure room.
$$Exposed persons can share a room.
I Most studies indicate that almost all adults with prior histories of varicella are immune. Thus, staff with positive histories should be considered immune. Sero-
logic screening may be useful in defining immunity of staff with negative or uncertain histories.
5


## p. 6 (#132) ##############################################

Potentially susceptible hospital personnel (Table 1) with significant exposure should not have direct patient con-
tact from the 10th through the 21st day after exposure, if they do not develop varicella. This is the period during
which chickenpox may occur. If they develop varicella, they should not have direct patient contact until all lesions
have dried and crusted, generally 6 days after rash onset.
In general, the same control measures should apply regardless of whether potentially susceptible personnel or
patients receive VZIG. Data on clinical attack rates and incubation periods of varicella following VZIG administra-
tion to normal adults are lacking. Studies of immunocompromised children with negative histories of previous
varicella treated with VZIG, who have had intense exposures, such as in the household setting, demonstrate that
approximately one-third to one-half will develop clinical varicella and could be infectious. Many of the remaining
susceptibles develop subclinical infections that theoretically may be infectious. In addition, VZIG may prolong
the average incubation period in immunocompromised patients from 14 to 18 days. The vast majority of cases
occur within 28 days of exposure in immunocompromised, VZIG-treated patients. Because of the potential of a
prolonged incubation period, personnel who receive VZIG should probably not work in patient areas for 10-28
days following exposure if no illness occurs.
USE
Administration
VZIG is of maximum benefit when administered as soon as possible after the presumed exposure but may be
effective given as late as 96 hours after exposure. VZIG has not been evaluated more than 96 hours after initial
exposure.
VZIG is not known to be useful in treating clinical varicella or zoster or in preventing disseminated zoster, and
it is not recommended for such use. The duration of protection after VZIG administration is unknown, but it
seems reasonable that protection should last for at least one half-life of immune globulin-approximately 3tit
weeks. To be safe, high-risk susceptibles who are again exposed more than 3 weeks after a prior dose of VZIG
should receive another full dose.
Dosage
VZIG is supplied in vials containing 125 units per vial (volume is approximately 1.25 cc). The recommended
dose is 125 units per 10 kg (22 lbs) body weight, up to a maximum of 625 units (i.e., five vials). The minimum
dose is 125 units. Fractional doses are not recommended. Some experts recommend 125 units per 10 kg of
body weight without limiting the total dose to 625 units. VZIG has not been evaluated as a prophylactic measure
for prevention or attenuation of varicella in normal or immunocompromised adults. Therefore, data do not exist
with which to calculate the appropriate dose in adults. However, it seems likely that 625 units should be suffi-
cient to prevent or modify infection in normal adults. Higher doses may be needed in immunocompromised
adults.
Route
VZIG should be administered intramuscularly as directed by the manufacturer. IT SHOULD NEVER BE ADMIN-
ISTERED INTRAVENOUSLY.
Supply
VZIG is produced by the Massachusetts Public Health Biologic Laboratories. Outside Massachusetts, distribu-
tion is arranged by the American Red Cross Blood Services -- Northeast Region, through other centers (Table 4).
VZIG is distributed within Massachusetts by the Massachusetts Public Health Biologic Laboratories.
ADVERSE REACTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS
The most frequent adverse event following VZIG is local discomfort at the injection site. Pain, redness, or
swelling occurs at the injection site in about 1% of patients. Less frequent adverse reactions are gastrointestinal
symptoms, malaise, headache, rash, and respiratory symptoms that occur in approximately 0.2% of recipients.
Severe reactions, such as angioneurotic edema and anaphylactic shock, are rare (less than 0.1%).
When VZIG is indicated for patients with severe thrombocytopenia or any other coagulation disorder that
would ordinarily contraindicate intramuscular injections, the expected benefits should outweigh the risks.

Update on Adult Immunization
Recommendations of the
Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
This statement on adult immunization is a supplement to the "General Recommendations on
Immunization" of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) (1 ) and updates the previous
supplement published in September 1984. This statement presents an overview on immunization for
adults and makes specific immunization recommendations. The statement provides information on
vaccine-preventable diseases; indications for use of vaccines, toxoids, and immune globulins recom-
mended for adults; and specific side effects, adverse reactions, precautions, and contraindications
associated with use of these immunobiologics. It also gives immunization recommendations for adults
in specific age groups and for those who have special immunization requirements because of
occupation, life-style, travel, environmental situations, and health status.
This statement is a compendium of ACIP recommendations and will not be updated regularly. The
ACIP periodically reviews individual immunization statements that are published in the MMWR. The
reader must use the detailed, up-to-date individual statements in conjunction with this compendium to
keep abreast of current information. A list of the current ACIP recommendations for specific diseases
and vaccines can be found in Appendix 1.
INTRODUCTION
General Considerations
Immunization policies have primarily been directed towards vaccinating infants, children, and
adolescents. Although vaccination is routine in pediatric practice, it is not commonplace in the practice
of physicians who treat adults.
The widespread implementation of childhood vaccination programs has substantially reduced the
occurrence of many vaccine-preventable diseases. However, successful childhood vaccination alone
will not eliminate specific disease problems. A substantial proportion of the remaining morbidity and
mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases presently occurs among older adolescents and adults.
Persons who escaped natural infection or were not vaccinated with toxoids or vaccines against
diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, and poliomyelitis may be at risk of these diseases and
their complications. Many factors have influenced the use of vaccines among adults, including lack of
awareness of safe vaccines and vaccine-preventable health burdens, unfounded concerns about
adverse reactions, and missed opportunities by health-care providers to vaccinate adults during office,
clinic, or hospital visits. To improve adult immunization levels, the National Coalition for Adult
Immunization (NCAI) was formed in 1988. The coalition consists of professional, private, public, and
voluntary organizations with the common goal of improving vaccine use among adults by educating
health-care providers and patients. A listing of member organizations is provided in Appendix 2.
To reduce further the unnecessary occurrence of these vaccine-preventable diseases, health-care
providers for older adolescents and adults should provide vaccinations as a routine part of their
practice. In addition, the epidemiology of other vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., hepatitis B, rabies,
influenza, and pneumococcal disease) indicates that persons in certain age, occupational, environ-
mental, and life-style groups and those with special health problems are at increased risk of these
illnesses and should be vaccinated. Travelers to some countries may also be at increased risk of
exposure to vaccine-preventable illnesses. Finally, foreign students, immigrants, and refugees may be
susceptible to these diseases.
A systematic approach to vaccination is necessary to ensure that every adult is appropriately
protected against vaccine-preventable diseases. Every visit by an adult to a health-care provider should
be an opportunity to provide this protection. However, several factors need to be considered before
any patient is vaccinated. These include the susceptibility of the patient, the risk of exposure to the
disease, the risk from the disease, and the benefits and risks of the immunizing agent.
Physicians should maintain detailed records containing information about each person's previous
vaccinations. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (NCVIA) requires physicians and other
health-care providers who administer vaccines to maintain permanent vaccination records and to
1


## p. 2 (#144) ##############################################

report occurrences of certain adverse events specified in the Act for all vaccines containing measles,
mumps, rubella, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis antigens for all patients, adults as
well as children (Table 1). Idealiy, information for all vaccines and toxoids should be recorded.
Information should also include the person's history of vaccine-preventable illnesses, occupation, and
life-style. Vaccines and toxoids administered at appropriate ages and intervals should be documented
in writing.
Attention to factors such as military service and age may help to determine whether vaccines or
toxoids are advisable for an individual. Persons who have served in the military can be considered to
have been vaccinated against measles, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, and polio. However, the practitio-
ner should be aware that policies of the different branches of the military have varied over time and
among the branches. After being administered any immunobiologic, the patient should be given
written documentation of its receipt and information about which vaccines or toxoids will be needed
in the future. For this purpose, a vaccination record such as the suggested form found in Appendix 3
should be used routinely.
The patient or responsible person (e.g., guardian) should be given information on the risks of
immunobiologics as well as their major benefits in preventing disease, both among individuals and in
the community. No formal, legally acceptable statement has been universally adopted for the private
medical sector. The NCVIA requires development and use of materials providing vaccine information
for all covered vaccines. All physicians must give those materials, when available, to prospective
vaccinees. However, CDC has developed "Important Information Statements" for use with vaccines
purchased through federal contracts. (Many of these will be replaced by "Vaccine Information
Pamphlets" in April 1992.) Practitioners may wish to consider these or similar materials for patients.
Examples of Important Information Statements can be obtained from state and many local health
departments. Forms are not available for all vaccines, however, especially those of limited use.
Regardless, the ACIP recommends that health-care providers allow ample opportunity for questions
before each vaccination.
Modern immunobiologics are extremely safe and effective, but not completely so. Adverse events
have been reported after administration of all immunobiologics. These adverse events range from
frequent, minor, local reactions to extremely rare, severe systemic illness, such as paralysis associated
with oral poliovirus vaccine, live, trivalent (OPV). Cause-and-effect relationships frequently cannot be
established when adverse events occur after vaccination, because temporal association alone does not
necessarily indicate causation. All temporally associated events severe enough to require the recipient
to seek medical attention should be evaluated and reported in detail to the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) in order to improve knowledge about adverse reactions. (See "Require-
ments for Permanent Vaccination Records and Reporting of Adverse Events” section.)
General vaccination considerations and recommendations are found in the ACIP statement "General
Recommendations on Immunization" (1). The following recommendations apply to persons in the
indicated groups. For more detailed information on immunobiologics-including indications, side
effects, adverse reactions, precautions, contraindications, dosages, and routes of administration,
providers should refer to the tables and appendices at the back of this supplement. Also, package
inserts for the individual products should be consulted as necessary. Appendix 4 provides a list of
vaccines, toxoids, and immune globulins available in the United States as of March 1, 1991.
Reference can also be made to the Guide for Adult Immunization (2), published by the American
College of Physicians, and to the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (3).
Age Groups
The following text and Table 2 summarize the vaccines and toxoids recommended for most adults,
by specific age groups. Table 3 summarizes the vaccines and toxoids recommended for normal infants
and children. Refer to the section "Vaccine-Preventable Diseases and Their Immunobiologics" for
other essential information.
Adults 18-24 Years Old
All young adults should complete a primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids if they have not
done so during childhood. A primary series for adults is three doses of preparations containing
diphtheria and tetanus toxoids; the first two doses should be given at least 4 weeks apart and the third
dose, 6-12 months after the second. Those who have completed a primary series should receive a
booster dose every 10 years. Doses need not be repeated when the series schedule is delayed. The
2


## p. 3 (#145) ##############################################

combined tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, adsorbed (for adult use) (Td), should be used. Persons with
unknown or uncertain histories of receiving diphtheria or tetanus toxoids should be considered
unvaccinated and should receive a full three-dose primary series of Td.
Young adults should be immune to measles, rubella, and mumps. In 1989, as a result of outbreaks
of measles in school and college settings, new recommendations were made to implement a routine
two-dose schedule for measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, live (MMR). The schedule will usually be
implemented gradually, one age group at a time, beginning with entry into kindergarten or first grade.
Some areas of the country may implement the second dose of MMR at an older age (e.g., entry into
middle school or junior high school). Young adults who are attending college (or other post-high
school educational institutions) or who are newly employed in situations that place them at high risk
of measles transmission (e.g., health-care facilities) should have documentation of having received
two doses of live MMR on or after their first birthday or other evidence of immunity. Persons born after
1956 who are traveling to areas endemic with measles should be given two doses of live MMR. All
other young adults in this age group should have documentation of a single dose of live MMR on or
after their first birthday, documentation of physician-diagnosed disease, or laboratory evidence of
immunity. Eventually, all persons in this age group will require two doses of measles vaccine.
However, until the new recommendations are fully implemented, a single dose on or after the first
birthday will be sufficient evidence of immunity for most persons.
During outbreaks of measles, all persons at risk should have evidence of immunity to measles.
Acceptable evidence of measles immunity consists of documentation of two doses of a live measles
vaccine (preferably MMR), given at least 1 month apart after the first birthday; documentation of
physician-diagnosed measles; or laboratory evidence of immunity to measles. During outbreaks of
mumps and rubella, all persons at risk should have evidence of immunity to mumps and rube
Acceptable evidence of mumps/rubella immunity consists of documentation of at least one dose of live
mumps- and/or rubella-containing vaccine (preferably MMR), laboratory evidence of immunity, or
physician-diagnosed mumps. Physician diagnosis is not adequate evidence of immunity against
rubella.
Persons vaccinated with killed-measles-virus vaccine (available in the United States from 1963 until
1967) or with a measles vaccine of unknown type should receive two doses of live-measles-virus
vaccine at least 1 month apart to prevent measles disease or atypical measles syndrome-if exposed to
wild measles virus. Persons are considered immune to rubella only if they have a record of vaccination
with rubella vaccine on or after their first birthday or laboratory evidence of immunity. MMR is the
vaccine of choice if recipients are likely to be susceptible to more than one of the three diseases.
Persons lacking adequate documentation should be vaccinated.
Adults 25-64 Years Old
All adults 25-64 years of age should have completed a primary series of diphtheria and tetanus
toxoids. If needed, a primary series for adults is three doses of preparations containing diphtheria and
tetanus toxoids-the first two doses given at least 4 weeks apart and the third dose given 6-12 months
after the second. Those who have completed a primary series should receive a booster dose every 10
years. To enhance protection against both diseases, Td should be used. Persons with unknown or
uncertain histories of receiving diphtheria or tetanus toxoids should be considered unvaccinated and
should receive a full three-dose primary series of Td.
All adults born in 1957 or later who do not have a medical contraindication should receive one dose
of measles vaccine unless they have a dated record of vaccination with at least one dose of live
measles vaccine on or after their first birthday, documentation of physician-diagnosed disease, or
laboratory evidence of immunity. Serologic studies of hospital workers indicate that up to 9.3% of
persons born before 1957 were not immune to measles (4,5). In addition, of all measles cases reported
to the CDC from 1985 through 1990, 3.7% occurred among persons born before 1957. These data
suggest that most persons born before 1957 can be considered immune to measles and do not need
to be vaccinated. However, 97 (29%) of 341 health-care workers who had measles in the period
1985-1989 were born before 1957 (6). Therefore, because health-care workers are at particularly high
risk of measles and a small proportion born before 1957 will be susceptible, vaccine should be offered
to such persons if there is reason to believe that they may be susceptible.
Some adults, such as college students, persons working in health-care facilities, and international
travelers, are at increased risk of measles. Such persons should have evidence of two doses of live
measles vaccine or other evidence of measles immunity, if born in 1957 or later.
3


## p. 4 (#146) ##############################################

Although most adults are likely to have been infected naturally with mumps, mumps vaccine should
be given to adults who are considered susceptible. Persons born in 1957 or later can be considered
immune if they have evidence of one dose of live mumps vaccine or other evidence of mumps
immunity.
Unless proof of vaccination with rubella vaccine or laboratory evidence of immunity is available,
rubella vaccine is recommended for adults, especially women of childbearing age. The vaccine of
choice is MMR if recipients are likely to be susceptible to more than one of these three diseases.
Adults >65 Years Old
All older adults should have completed a primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. If needed,
a primary series for adults is three doses of preparations containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoids;
the first two doses should be given at least 4 weeks apart and the third dose 6-12 months after the
second. Those who have completed a primary series should receive a booster dose every 10 years. Td
should be used to provide protection against both diseases. Persons with unknown or uncertain
histories of receiving diphtheria or tetanus toxoids should be considered unvaccinated and should
receive a full three-dose primary series of Td.
All older adults should receive influenza vaccine annually. They should also receive a single dose of
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Revaccination should be strongly considered >6 years after the
first dose for those at highest risk of a) fatal pneumococcal disease (such as asplenic patients) or
b) rapid decline in antibody levels (e.g., transplant recipients or those with chronic renal failure or
nephrotic syndrome).
Special Occupations
Persons in specific occupations may be at increased risk of exposure to certain vaccine-preventable
illnesses. Such persons may need selected vaccines and toxoids in addition to those routinely
recommended for their age group. Table 4 provides a summary of immunobiologics recommended for
various special occupational groups. The reader is referred to the section on "Vaccine-Preventable
Diseases and Their Immunobiologics' for other essential information.
Health- and Public-Safety-Related Occupations
Because of their contact with patients or infectious material from patients, many health-care workers
(e.g., physicians, nurses, dental professionals, medical and nursing students, laboratory technicians,
and administrative staff) and public-safety workers (e.g., police, emergency medical personnel,
firefighters) are at risk for exposure to and possible transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases.
Optimal use of immunizing agents will not only safeguard the health of workers but also will protect
patients from becoming infected. A consistent program of vaccinations could eliminate the problem of
having susceptible health-care workers in hospitals and health departments (with the attendant risks
to other workers and patients). The CDC publication Immunization Recommendations for Health-Care
Workers (7) and the section below discuss this subject in detail.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major occupational hazard for health-care and public-safety
workers. The risk of acquiring HBV infection from occupational exposures depends on the frequency
of percutaneous and permucosal exposures to blood or blood products. Any health-care or public-
safety worker may be at risk for HBV exposure, depending on the tasks that he or she performs. If those
tasks involve contact with blood or blood-contaminated body fluids, workers should be vaccinated.
Vaccination should be considered for other workers, depending on their exposure to blood and/or
bodily fluids. Selected staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled may be at increased risk of
HBV infection because of exposure to human bites and contact with skin lesions, saliva, and other
potentially infected secretions in addition to blood. The Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
tion, Department of Labor, is developing regulations that will require employers who have employees
at risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis B to offer these employees hepatitis B (HB) vaccine at the
employer's expense. These regulations are expected to accelerate and broaden the use of HB vaccine
among health-care workers and to assure efforts to prevent this occupational disease.
Among health-care personnel with frequent exposure to blood, the prevalence of serologic evidence
of HBV infection ranges between approximately 15% and 30%. In contrast, the prevalence in the
general population averages 5%. The cost-effectiveness of serologic screening to detect susceptible
individuals among health-care personnel depends on the prevalence of infection and the costs of
testing and of the HB vaccine. Each institution must decide whether serologic screening is cost
4


## p. 5 (#147) ##############################################

effective. Vaccination of persons who already have antibodies to HBV has not been shown to cause
adverse effects. HB vaccine provides protection against HBV for 7 years after vaccination; booster
doses are not recommended during this interval. The need for later booster doses will be assessed as
additional information becomes available.
Influenza vaccination is recommended yearly for physicians, nurses, and other personnel in
hospital, chronic-care, and outpatient-care settings who have contact with high-risk patients in all age
groups. Those who provide essential community services (e.g., public-safety workers) may consider
receiving the vaccine also. Vaccination should reduce the possibility of transmitting influenza from
health-care workers to patients and reduce health-care workers' risk of illness and absenteeism due to
influenza.
Transmission of rubella in health facilities (e.g., hospitals, physicians' or dentists' offices, and clinics)
can disrupt hospital or office routines and cause considerable expense. Although no cases of
congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) have been reported in association with rubella transmission in
health facilities, therapeutic abortions have been sought by pregnant staff members after rubella
infection (8). To prevent such situations, all medical, dental, laboratory, and other support health
personnel, both male and female, who might be at risk of exposure to patients infected with rubella or
who might have contact with pregnant patients should be vaccinated. Rubella vaccine is recom-
mended for all such personnel unless they have either proof of vaccination with rubella vaccine on or
after their first birthday or laboratory evidence of immunity. The vaccine of choice is MMR if recipients
are likely to be susceptible to measles and/or mumps as well as to rubella.
Measles and mumps transmission in health facilities can also be disruptive and costly. To prevent
such situations, all new employees in health-care facilities who were born in 1957 or later who may
have direct patient contact should be vaccinated. Such persons can be considered immune only if they
have documentation of having received two doses of live measles vaccine and at least one dose of live
mumps vaccine on or after their first birthday, a record of physician-diagnosed measles or mumps, or
laboratory evidence of immunity. Institutions may wish to extend this requirement to all employees,
not only beginning ones. If recipients are likely to be susceptible to rubella as well as to measles and
mumps, MMR is the vaccine of choice. Adults born before 1957 can be considered immune to both
measles and mumps because these infections were virtually universal before the availability of
measles and mumps vaccines. However, because serologic studies of hospital workers indicate that up
to 9.3% of those born before 1957 were not immune to measles (4,5) and because 97 (29%) of 341
health-care workers who had measles in the period 1985-1989 in medical facilities were born before
1957 (6), health facilities should consider requiring at least one dose of measles vaccine for older
employees who are at risk of occupational exposure to measles and do not have proof of immunity to
this disease.
Poliovirus vaccine is not routinely recommended for persons older than high-school age (>18 years
old). However, hospital personnel who have close contact with patients who may be excreting wild
polioviruses and laboratory personnel who handle specimens that may contain wild polioviruses
should have completed a primary series of poliovirus vaccine. For personnel who do not have proof of
having completed a primary series, completion with enhanced potency inactivated poliovirus vaccine
(elPV) is recommended. This vaccine is preferred because adults have a slightly increased risk of
vaccine-associated paralysis after receiving OPV. In addition, because vaccine polioviruses may be
excreted by OPV recipients for >30 days, the use of OPV increases the risk of acquiring vaccine-
associated paralytic poliomyelitis among susceptible immunocompromised OPV recipients and/or
their close contacts.
Smallpox (vaccinia) vaccination is indicated only for laboratory workers involved with orthopox
viruses and certain health-care workers involved in clinical trials of vaccinia recombinant vaccines.
When indicated, smallpox (vaccinia) vaccination should be given at least every 10 years.
Plague vaccine is indicated for laboratory personnel working with Yersinia pestis possibly resistant
to antimicrobial agents and for persons performing aerosol experiments with Y. pestis.
Anthrax vaccine is indicated for laboratory personnel working with Bacillus anthracis.
Preexposure rabies vaccination is indicated for laboratory workers directly involved with testing or
isolating rabies virus.
Veterinarians and Animal Handlers
Veterinarians and animal handlers are at risk of rabies exposure because of occupational contact
with domestic and wild animals. They should receive preexposure prophylaxis with human diploid cell
5


## p. 6 (#148) ##############################################

rabies vaccine (HDCV). Preexposure vaccination against rabies does not eliminate the need for
additional therapy after exposure to rabies. Preexposure vaccination does, however, simplify postex-
posure therapy by eliminating the need for human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and by decreasing
the number of postexposure doses of vaccine needed. Persons at continued risk of frequent exposure
should receive a booster dose of HDCV every 2 years or have their serum tested for rabies antibody
every 2 years; if the titer is inadequate (<5 by the rapid fluorescent-focus inhibition test), they should
receive a booster dose.
Plague vaccine should be considered in the western United States for veterinarians and their
assistants who may be exposed to bubonic or pneumonic infection in animals, particularly domestic
cats.
Selected Field Personnel
Plague vaccine is indicated for field personnel who cannot avoid regular exposure to potentially
plague-infected wild rodents and rabbits and their fleas.
Preexposure rabies vaccine prophylaxis should be considered for field personnel who are likely to
have contact with potentially rabid dogs, cats, skunks, raccoons, bats, or other wildlife species.
Selected Occupations
Anthrax vaccine is indicated for individuals who come in contact in the workplace with imported
animal hides, furs, bonemeal, wool, animal hair (especially goat hair), and bristles.
Sewage workers, as all other adults, should be adequately vaccinated against diphtheria and
tetanus. Sewage workers are not at increased risk of polio, typhoid fever, or hepatitis A; poliovirus and
typhoid vaccines and immune globulin (1G) are not routinely recommended for them.
Life-Styles
Various life-styles may increase the risk of exposure to certain vaccine-preventable illnesses.
Persons with these life-styles may require vaccines in addition to those routinely recommended for
their age group. Table 4 provides a summary of the vaccines recommended.
Homosexually Active Males
Homosexually active males are at high risk of HBV as well as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection. Between 35% and 80% have serologic evidence of HBV infection. Susceptible homosexual
males should be vaccinated with HB vaccine as early as possible after they begin homosexual activity
because 10%-20% can be expected to acquire HBV infection each year. Because of the high prevalence
of infection, serologic screening of homosexual males before vaccination may be cost effective
regardless of age or length of homosexual activity. Homosexual men known to have HIV infection
should be tested for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) 1-6 months after completing the
vaccine series (HB vaccine is less effective among HIV-infected persons than among similar persons
without HIV infection). Revaccination with one or more doses should be considered if the level of
antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is <10 milli-international units (m/U]/milliliter (mL).
Injecting Drug Users
Injecting drug users are at high risk of HBV as well as HIV infection. Serologic evidence of HBV
infection has been found in 60%-80% of these individuals. Efforts should be made to vaccinate
susceptible users with HB vaccine as early as possible after their drug use begins, because 10%-20%
can be expected to acquire HBV infection each year. Because of the high prevalence of infection,
serologic screening of injecting drug users before vaccination to avoid unnecessary vaccination is cost
effective. Injecting drug users with known HIV infection should be tested for antibody to HBsAg 1-6
months after completion of the vaccine series; revaccination with one or more doses should be
considered if their anti-HBs level is <10 mIU/mL.
Drug users are also at increased risk of tetanus; their tetanus vaccination status should therefore be
kept up to date with Td.
Heterosexually Active Persons
Heterosexually active persons with multiple sex partners are at increased risk of HBV infection.
Vaccination is recommended for persons who are diagnosed to have other sexually transmitted
diseases, for male or female prostitutes, and for persons who have had sexual activity with multiple
partners during the previous 6 months.

## p. 7 (#149) ##############################################

Environmental Situations
Certain environments may place an individual at increased risk of vaccine-preventable diseases.
Table 4 summarizes additional vaccines recommended for persons in selected environments. The
section on "Vaccine-Preventable Diseases and Their Immunobiologics" contains other essential
information.
Inmates of Long-Term Correctional Facilities
Serologic evidence of HBV infection has been found among 10%-80% of male prisoners. Although
the frequency of transmission during imprisonment has not been clearly documented, the environ-
ment of long-term correctional facilities may be associated with a high risk of transmission of HBV
infection because of the likelihood of homosexual behavior and of injecting drug use. In selected
long-term institutional settings, prison officials may elect to undertake serologic HBV screening and
vaccination programs.
Measles and rubella outbreaks have been documented in long-term correctional facilities. All
inmates of such facilities should be vaccinated against measles and rubella. If recipients are likely to
be susceptible to mumps as well as to measles and rubella, MMR is the vaccine of choice.
All inmates of such facilities >65 years of age and those with high-risk conditions, including HIV
infection, should receive yearly influenza vaccination. Pneumococcal vaccination within the past
6 years should also be documented.
Residents of Institutions for the Developmentally Disabled
Institutions for the developmentally disabled provide a setting conducive to the transmission of HBV
infection through human bites and contact with residents' blood, skin lesions, saliva, and other
potentially infectious secretions. Serologic evidence of HBV infection has been found among 35%-80%
of residents of such institutions. Persons newly admitted to these institutions should be vaccinated as
soon as possible. For current residents, screening and vaccination of susceptible residents is
recommended. Because of the high prevalence of infection, serologic screening before vaccination of
those already institutionalized may be cost effective; however, screening of new admissions very likely
will not be. Residents of group homes, foster homes, and similar settings who have household contact
with an HBV carrier should also be vaccinated.
Many of the residents of these institutions have chronic medical conditions that put them at risk for
complications from influenza illness; therefore, all residents should receive influenza vaccine yearly.
Household Contacts of HBV Carriers
Household contacts of HBV carriers are at high risk of infection. When HBV carriers are identified
through routine screening of donated blood, prenatal screening, or other screening programs, the
carriers should be notified of their status. All household contacts should be tested and susceptible
contacts vaccinated.
Homeless Persons
There are limited data on vaccine-preventable diseases among the homeless. However, such
persons will need completed vaccinations for tetanus, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, influenza,
and pneumococcal disease. Also, some will be at risk for HBV infection and some will require
tuberculin skin testing. The vaccination status of homeless persons should be assessed whenever they
are seen in any medical setting.
Travel
The risk of acquiring illness during international travel depends on the areas to be visited and the
extent to which the traveler is likely to be exposed to diseases. When considering travel, people often
seek advice regarding vaccination from health-care personnel. This provides a good opportunity to
review the person's vaccination status and to administer primary series or booster doses, if needed.
In most countries, measles, mumps, and rubella remain uncontrolled. Therefore, the risk of
acquiring these diseases while traveling outside the United States is greater than the risk incurred
within the United States. Approximately 61% of imported measles cases reported for 1985-1989
occurred among citizens returning to the United States (CDC, unpublished data). To minimize diseases
imported by U.S. citizens, all persons traveling abroad should be immune to measles. Consideration
should be given to providing a dose of measles vaccine to persons born in or after 1957 who travel
abroad, who have not previously received two doses of measles vaccine, and who do not have other
7


## p. 8 (#150) ##############################################

evidence of measles immunity (e.g., physician-diagnosed measles or laboratory evidence of measles
immunity). If recipients are likely to be susceptible to mumps or rubella in addition to measles, MMR
is the vaccine of choice. Travelers, particularly women of childbearing ages, should be immune to
rubella before leaving the United States.
In developed countries such as Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and European countries, the
risk of acquiring other vaccine-preventable diseases such as poliomyelitis, diphtheria, and tetanus is
usually no greater than the risk incurred while traveling in the United States. In contrast, travelers to
developing countries are at increased risk of exposure to many infections, including wild polioviruses
and diphtheria. Accordingly, such travelers should be immune to poliomyelitis and diphtheria in
particular.
For protection against poliomyelitis, unvaccinated adults should receive at least two doses of elPV
1 month apart, preferably a complete primary series, before traveling to a developing country or any
country with endemic polio; elPV is preferred because the risk of vaccine-associated paralysis is
slightly higher for adults than for children. If travel plans do not permit this interval, a single dose of
either OPV or elPV is recommended. For adults previously incompletely vaccinated with OPV or
inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), the remaining doses of either vaccine required for completion of
the primary series should be given, regardless of the interval since the last dose or the type of vaccine
previously received. Travelers to developing countries who have previously completed a primary
series of OPV should receive a single supplementary dose of OPV. Those who have previously received
a primary series of IPV should receive a single supplementary dose of either OPV or elPV. The need for
further doses of either vaccine has not been established.
Persons whose age or health status places them at increased risk of complications from influenza
illness and who are planning travel to the tropics at any time of year or the southern hemisphere during
April through September should review their influenza vaccination history. If not vaccinated during the
previous fall or winter, such persons should consider influenza vaccination before travel. Persons in
the high-risk categories should be especially encouraged to receive the most currently available
vaccine. Persons at high risk given the previous season's vaccine in preparation for travel should be
revaccinated in the fall or winter with the current vaccine and therefore may receive two doses of
influenza vaccine within 1 year.
Selective vaccination of travelers with vaccines against yellow fever, cholera, typhoid, plague,
meningococcal disease, rabies, or HBV infection, or administration of IG to prevent hepatitis A, is
recommended on the basis of known or perceived disease-specific risks in the country or countries to
be visited and the type and duration of travel within a country. For cholera and yellow fever,
vaccination requirements may have been established by the country to be visited. Countries currently
reporting yellow fever, cholera, and plague are identified biweekly in the Summary of Health
Information for International Travel.* Information on known or possibly infected areas is published
annually in Health Information for International Travel,* which also lists specific requirements for
cholera and yellow fever vaccinations for each country. All state health departments and many county
and city health departments receive both publications. They may also be obtained by calling CDC
Information Services at 404-639-1819. For entry into countries requiring yellow fever or cholera
vaccination, travelers must have an International Certificate of Vaccination validated by an appropriate
authority. State or local health departments can provide the addresses of persons or centers able to
validate certificates.
Additional information on specific vaccine-preventable illnesses that a traveler might encounter is
provided in the sections describing specific vaccines.
Foreign Students, Immigrants, and Refugees
In many countries, children and adolescents are not routinely vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus,
measles, mumps, rubella, and poliomyelitis. As a result, persons entering the United States as college
or postgraduate students, immigrants, or refugees may be susceptible to one or more of these
diseases.
Refugees from areas of high HBV endemicity (e.g., Southeast Asia) should be screened for HBsAg
and anti-HBs. Susceptible household and sexual contacts of HBsAg carriers should receive HB vaccine.

Unless foreign students, immigrants, and refugees can provide a vaccination record documenting
the receipt of recommended vaccines or toxoids at appropriate ages and intervals or laboratory
evidence of immunity, they should receive the appropriate vaccines for their age, as noted in the “Age Groups"
section and in Table 2.
Special Health Status
Some vaccines may be contraindicated for persons with certain health problems; other vaccines
may be indicated because of an underlying health condition. Table 5 provides a summary of
immunobiologics indicated or contraindicated for persons with selected health problems.
Pregnancy
When any vaccine or toxoid is to be given during pregnancy, delaying until the second or third
trimester, when possible, is a reasonable precaution to minimize concern about possible terato-
genicity.
Pregnant women not vaccinated previously against tetanus and diphtheria should receive two doses
of Td, properly spaced. Those who have previously received one or two doses of tetanus or diphtheria
toxoid should complete their primary series during pregnancy. A primary series is three doses of
preparations containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, with the first two doses given at least 4 weeks
apart and the third dose given 6-12 months after the second. Pregnant women who have completed a
primary series should receive a booster dose of Td if >10 years have elapsed since their last dose.
Because of a theoretical risk to the developing fetus, live-virus vaccines usually should not be given
to pregnant women or to those likely to become pregnant within 3 months. If, however, immediate
protection against poliomyelitis or yellow fever is needed because of imminent exposure, OPV or
yellow fever vaccine may be given. If the only reason to vaccinate a pregnant woman with yellow fever
vaccine is an international travel requirement, efforts should be made to obtain a waiver letter. The
ACIP strongly recommends that rubella vaccine be administered in the postpartum period to women
not known to be immune, preferably before discharge from the hospital.
Data are not available on the safety of HB vaccines for the developing fetus. Because the vaccines
contain only noninfectious HBsAg particles, the fetus should not be at risk. In contrast, HBV infection
in a pregnant woman may result in severe disease for the mother and chronic infection of the newborn.
Therefore, pregnancy or lactation should not be considered a contraindication to the use of this vaccine
for persons who are otherwise eligible. Prenatal screening of all pregnant women for HBsAg is
recommended. Such screening identifies those who are HBsAg positive and allows treatment of their
newborns with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and HB vaccine, a regimen that is 85%-95%
effective in preventing the development of chronic carriage of the HBV.
Pregnant women who have other medical conditions that increase their risks for complications from
influenza should be vaccinated; the vaccine is considered safe for pregnant women. Administering the
vaccine after the first trimester is a reasonable precaution to minimize any concern over the theoretical
risk of teratogenicity. However, it is undesirable to delay vaccinating pregnant women who have
high-risk conditions and who will still be in the first trimester of pregnancy when the influenza season
begins.
The safety of pneumococcal vaccine for pregnant women has not been evaluated. Ideally, women
at high risk of pneumococcal disease should be vaccinated before pregnancy.
Information about immunobiologics and vaccinc-preventable diseases during pregnancy is sum-
marized in Appendix 5.
Conditions that Compromise the Immune System
Persons receiving immunosuppressive therapies or with conditions that compromise their immune
responses (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, and HIV infection) should receive
annual influenza vaccinations with the currently formulated vaccine. Persons with these conditions
have been associated with increased risk of pneumococcal disease or its complications and should
receive a single dose of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; revaccination should be considered
6 years after the first dose. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine (HbCV) is of
unproven benefit in immunocompromised persons but may be considered for those with anatomic or
functional asplenia or HIV infection. The effectiveness of these vaccines among such persons may be
limited, but the risk of disease is substantial and adverse reactions are minimal.
Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), oral typhoid vaccine, or live-virus vaccines should not be given to
persons who are immunocompromised as a result of immune deficiency diseases, leukemia,
9

lymphoma, or generalized malignancy or who are immunosuppressed as a result of therapy with
corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation. However, susceptible patients with
leukemia in remission who have not had chemotherapy for at least 3 months may receive live-virus
vaccines. The exact interval between discontinuing immunosuppressives and regaining the ability to
respond to individual vaccines is not known. Estimates of experts vary from 3 months to 1 year (9). In
addition, persons with asymptomatic HIV infection should be vaccinated against measles, mumps, and
rubella. Such vaccination should be considered for persons with symptomatic HIV infection because of
the danger of serious or fatal measles and the accumulating evidence of the safety of administering
MMR to these patients (Table 6).
Short-term (<2-week) corticosteroid therapy, topical steroid therapy (e.g., nasal or skin), and
intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injections with corticosteroids should not be immunosuppressive and
do not contraindicate vaccination with live-virus vaccines. Vaccination should be avoided if systemic
immunosuppressive levels are achieved by topical application.
Vaccines given to immunocompromised patients cannot be assumed to be as effective as when
given to normal individuals. When available, postvaccination antibody titrations can be done, but, in
the absence of specific antibody information, appropriate immune globulins should be considered for
exposures to vaccine-preventable diseases, as discussed in the "Immune Globulins' section.
Hemodialysis and Transplantation
Persons receiving hemodialysis have been at high risk of infection with HBV, although environmen-
tal control measures have reduced this risk during the past decade. Nationwide, an estimated 15% of
hemodialysis patients have serologic evidence of HBV infection, and routine serologic screening of
hemodialysis patients is currently recommended. Susceptible patients who will soon require or are
currently receiving long-term hemodialysis should receive three doses of HB vaccine as soon as
possible. Larger doses (two to four times those for healthy adults) and/or increased numbers of doses
are recommended for these patients because of lower vaccine immunogenicity. The individual
manufacturer's vaccine package inserts should be inspected to learn the proper dosages of each
vaccine. Postvaccination screening to demonstrate antibody to HBsAg is recommended in this group.
Approximately 60% of hemodialysis patients who receive recommended doses of HB vaccine develop
protective antibodies against HBV. Revaccination with one or more additional doses should be
considered for persons who do not respond to vaccination. In hemodialysis patients, protection lasts
only as long as anti-HBs levels remain >10 mlU/mL. Such patients should be tested for anti-HBs
annually and revaccinated when anti-HBs declines below this level.
Because renal transplant recipients and persons with chronic renal disease are at increased risk of
adverse consequences (including transplant rejection) from infections of the lower respiratory tract,
these persons should receive annual influenza vaccination with the current formulated vaccine.
Because these patients are also at increased risk of developing pneumococcal infection and experi-
encing more severe pneumococcal disease, they should receive pneumococcal polysaccharide
vaccine.
Splenic Dysfunction or Anatomic Asplenia
Persons with splenic dysfunction or anatomic asplenia are at increased risk of contracting fatal
pneumococcal bacteremia and should receive pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. They are also at
risk for meningococcal bacteremia and should receive meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The
theoretical increased risk for invasive Hib disease suggests that such persons may be considered for
HbCV. Persons scheduled for elective splenectomy should receive both pneumococcal and meningo-
coccal polysaccharide vaccines at least 2 weeks before the operation.
Factor VIII and IX Deficiencies
Patients with clotting disorders who receive factor VIII or IX concentrates have an increased risk of
HBV infection. Such patients without serologic markers for hepatitis B should be vaccinated against
hepatitis B before receiving any blood products. To avoid hemorrhagic complications, vaccination
should be given subcutaneously (SC), rather than intramuscularly (IM) as in the nonhemophilic patient.
Prevaccination serologic screening for HBV markers is recommended for patients who have already
received multiple infusions of these products.

Chronic Alcoholism
Persons with chronic alcoholism may be at increased risk of contracting a pneumococcal infection
or having a more severe pneumococcal illness. Such persons, especially those with cirrhosis, should
receive pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.
High-Risk Diseases
Persons with disease conditions that increase the risk of adverse consequences from lower-
respiratory-tract infections should receive annual influenza vaccination with the current formulated
vaccine. These conditions include the following: acquired or congenital heart disease with actual or
potentially altered circulatory dynamics; any chronic disorder or condition that compromises pulmo-
nary function; diabetes mellitus or other metabolic diseases that increase the likelihood that infections
will be more severe; chronic renal disease with azotemia or nephrotic syndrome; and chronic
hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell disease.
Some chronic illnesses (e.g., chronic pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus)
predispose individuals to an increased risk of pneumococcal illness or its complications. Such persons
should receive pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.
REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMANENT VACCINATION RECORDS AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
NOVIA requires physicians and other health-care providers who administer vaccines to maintain
permanent vaccination records and to report occurrences of certain adverse events specified in the Act
(Table 1). The vaccines and toxoids to which these requirements apply are measles, mumps, and
rubella single-antigen vaccines and combination vaccines (MMR, measles, rubella vaccine, live (MR]);
diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, adsorbed (pediatric) (DT); Td; tetanus toxoid, adsorbed (T); OPV; IPV;
diphtheria andtetanustoxoidsand pertussis vaccine, adsorbed (pediatric)(DTP); and pertussis vaccine (P).
Requirements for Recording
All health-care providers who administer one or more of these vaccines or toxoids are required to
ensure that the recipient's permanent medical record (or a permanent office log or file) states the date
the vaccine was administered, the vaccine manufacturer, the vaccine lot number, the name, the
address, and the title of the person administering the vaccine. The term health-care provider is defined
as any licensed health-care professional, organization, or institution, whether private or public
(including federal, state, and local departments and agencies), under whose authority a specified
vaccine is administered.
Requirements for Reporting Adverse Events
Health-care providers are required to report selected events occurring after vaccination to the
Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS).
Reportable adverse events are shown in Table 1 and include events described in the vaccine
manufacturer's package insert as contraindications to receiving additional doses of vaccine.
Adverse events other than those listed on Table 1 or occurring after administration of other vaccines,
especially events that are serious or unusual, can also be reported to VAERS. VAERS forms and
instructions are available in the FDA Drug Bulletin (Food and Drug Administration) and the Physicians'
Desk Reference or by calling VAERS at 1-800-822-7967.
Vaccine Injury Compensation
The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is a system under which compensation can be
paid on behalf of an individual who died or was injured as a result of being given a vaccine. The
program is intended as an alternative to civil litigation under the traditional torts system in that
negligence need not be proven. The program was created by NCVIA and became effective on October 1, 1988.
11


## p. 12 (#154) #############################################

The law established a vaccine injury table (Table 1), which lists the vaccines covered by the program
as well as the injuries, disabilities, illnesses, and conditions (including death) for which compensation
may be paid. The program also sets out the period of time during which the first symptom or
significant aggravation of the injury must appear. This period often differs from that required for
reporting. Persons may be compensated for an injury listed in Table 1 or one that can be demonstrated
to result from administration of a listed vaccine. Additional information about the program is available

VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES AND THEIR IMMUNOBIOLOGICS
Vaccines, toxoids, and immune globulins are available for use in preventing many diseases. These
diseases and their specific immunobiologics are presented in this section. For each immunobiologic,
the dosage, route of delivery, indications for use, side effects, adverse reactions, precautions, and
contraindications are described here. These are also summarized in Table 7.
Toxoids
Diphtheria
The occurrence of diphtheria has decreased dramatically in the United States, largely because of the
widespread use of diphtheria toxoid. Only 11 cases of respiratory diphtheria were reported in the
period 1985-1989. Seven of these 11 cases occurred among adults >20 years of age, and three among
adults >60 years of age. Diphtheria occurs primarily among unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated
individuals. Limited serosurveys done since 1977 indicate that 22%-62% of adults 18-39 years of age
and 41%-84% of those > 60 years of age lack protective levels of circulating antitoxin against diphtheria
(10-13).
Diphtheria toxoid. Complete and appropriately timed vaccination is at least 85% effective in
preventing diphtheria. The combined preparation Td is recommended for use among adults because
a large proportion of them lack protective levels of circulating antibody against tetanus (10-13).
Furthermore, Td contains much less diphtheria toxoid than other diphtheria toxoid-containing
products, and, as a result, reactions to the diphtheria component are less likely. Vaccination with any
diphtheria toxoid does not, however, prevent or eliminate carriage of Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
Toxoid indications. All adults lacking a completed primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids
should complete the series with Td. A primary series for adults is three doses of preparations
containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, with the first two doses given at least 4 weeks apart and the
third dose given 6-12 months after the second. All adults for whom >10 years have elapsed since
completion of their primary series or since their last booster dose should receive a dose of Td.
Thereafter, a booster dose of Td should be administered every 10 years. There is no need to repeat
doses if the schedule for the primary series or booster doses is delayed.
Tetanus
The occurrence of tetanus has decreased dramatically, largely because of the widespread use of
tetanus toxoid. Nevertheless, the number of cases remained relatively constant from 1986 through
1989, during which 48-64 cases were reported annually. Tetanus occurs almost exclusively among
12.

unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated persons. Immune pregnant women transfer temporary
protection against tetanus to their infants through transplacental maternal antibody.
In the period 1982-1989, persons >20 years of age accounted for 95% of the 513 reported tetanus
cases for which patient ages were known; persons >60 years of age accounted for 59%. The age
distribution of persons who died from tetanus was similar. Serosurveys done since 1977 indicate that
6%-11% of adults 18-39 years of age and 49%-66% of those >60 years of age lack protective levels of
circulating antitoxin against tetanus (10-13). Although surveys of emergency rooms suggest that only
1%-6% of all persons who receive medical care for injuries that can lead to tetanus receive inadequate
prophylaxis (14), in 1987-1988, 81% of the people who developed tetanus after an acute injury and
sought medical care did not receive adequate prophylaxis as recommended by the ACIP (14).
Tetanus toxoid. Complete and appropriately timed vaccination is nearly 100% effective in prevent-
ing tetanus. Td is the preferred preparation for active tetanus immunization of adults because a large
proportion of them also lack protective levels of circulating antitoxin against diphtheria (10-13).
Toxoid indications. All adults lacking a complete primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids
should complete the series with Td. A primary series for adults is three doses of preparations
containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, with the first two doses given at least 4 weeks apart and the
third dose given 6-12 months after the second. Persons who have served in the military can be
considered to have received a primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. The practitioner should
be aware that policies of the different branches of the military have varied among themselves and over
time. All adults for whom >10 years have elapsed since completion of their primary series or since
their last booster dose should receive a booster dose of Td. Thereafter, a booster dose of Td should be
administered every 10 years. Doses need not be repeated if the primary schedule for the series or
booster doses is delayed.
The recommended pediatric schedule for DTP includes a booster dose at age 4-6 years. The first
Td booster is recommended at age 14-16 years (10 years after the dose at age 4-6 years). One means
of ensuring that persons continue to receive boosters every 10 years is to vaccinate persons routinely
at mid-decade ages (e.g., 25 years of age, 35 years of age).
For wound management, the need for active immunization, with or without passive immunization,
depends on the condition of the wound and the patient's vaccination history. A summary of the
indications for active and passive immunization is provided in Table 8. Only rarely have cases of
tetanus occurred among persons with a documented primary series of toxoid injections.
Evidence indicates that complete primary vaccination with tetanus toxoid provides long-lasting
protection (>10 years among most recipients). Consequently, after complete primary tetanus vacci-
nation, boosters are recommended at 10-year intervals. For clean and minor wounds occurring during
the 10-year interval, no additional booster is recommended. For other wounds, a booster is appropriate
if the patient has not received tetanus toxoid within the preceding 5 years. Antitoxin antibodies
develop rapidly in persons who have previously received at least two doses of tetanus toxoid.
Persons who have not completed a full primary series of injections or whose vaccination status is
unknown or uncertain may require tetanus toxoid and passive immunization at the time of wound
cleaning and debridement. Ascertaining the interval since the most recent toxoid dose is not sufficient.
A careful attempt should be made to determine whether a patient has previously completed primary
vaccination and, if not, how many doses have been given. Persons with unknown or uncertain previous
vaccination histories should be considered to have had no previous tetanus toxoid doses.
In managing the wounds of adults, Td is the preferred preparation for active tetanus immuniza-
tion. This toxoid preparation is also used to enhance protection against diphtheria, because a large
proportion of adults are susceptible. Thus, if advantage is taken of visits for care of acute health
problems, such as for wound management, some patients who otherwise would remain susceptible
can be protected against both diseases. Primary vaccination should ultimately be completed for
persons documented to have received fewer than the recommended number of doses, including doses
given as part of wound management.
If passive immunization is needed, human tetanus immune globulin (TIG) is the product of choice.
The currently recommended prophylactic dose of TIG for wounds of average severity is 250 units IM.
13


## p. 14 (#156) #############################################

When T or Td and TIG are given concurrently, separate syringes and separate sites should be used.
Most experts consider the use of adsorbed toxoid mandatory in this situation.
Toxoid Side Effects and Adverse Reactions
Local reactions (usually erythema and induration, with or without tenderness) can occur after Td is
administered. Fever and other systemic symptoms are less common.
Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions, characterized by severe local reactions starting 2-8 hours
after an injection and often associated with fever and malaise, may occur, particularly among persons
who have received multiple boosters of tetanus toxoid, adsorbed (T).
Rarely, severe systemic reactions, such as generalized urticaria, anaphylaxis, or neurologic compli-
cations, have been reported after administration of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Peripheral
neuropathy has been reported rarely after administration of T, although a causal relationship has not
been established.
Toxoid Precautions and Contraindications
Although no evidence suggests that diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are teratogenic, waiting until the
second trimester of pregnancy to administer Td is a reasonable precaution.
A history of a neurologic reaction or a severe hypersensitivity reaction (e.g., generalized urticaria or
anaphylaxis) after a previous dose is a contraindication to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. Local side
effects alone do not preclude continued use. If a prior systemic reaction suggests allergic hypersen-
sitivity, appropriate skin testing to document immediate hypersensitivity may be useful before
T vaccination is discontinued. Protocols exist for using both Td and single-antigen tetanus toxoids for
skin testing (15). Mild, nonspecific skin-test reactivity to T toxoid is common. Most vaccinees develop
a delayed but inconsequential cutaneous hypersensitivity to the toxoid.
Persons experiencing severe Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions to a dose of T usually have very
high serum tetanus antitoxin levels and should not be given even emergency booster doses of Td more
frequently than every 10 years.
If a contraindication to using preparations containing T exists in a person who has not completed a
primary immunizing course of T and other than a clean minor wound is sustained, only passive
immunization should be given using TIG.
Although a minor illness, such as a mild upper respiratory infection, should not be cause for
postponing vaccination, a severe febrile illness is reason to defer routine vaccination.
Live-Virus Vaccines
Measles
Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963, approximately 500,000 cases of measles and 500
measles-associated deaths were reported annually in the United States. Because of the widespread
use of measles vaccine, the number of reported measles cases decreased to an all-time low of 1,497
in 1983. From 1984 through 1988, the annual number of reported measles cases averaged 3,600, which
represents <1% of the cases reported annually in the prevaccine era. In 1989 and 1990, a substantial
increase in cases was reported, primarily because of a large number of outbreaks among unvaccinated
preschool-age children and vaccinated high-school and college-age students. The 27,786 cases
provisionally reported in 1990 represent the largest number of cases reported in any year since 1978.
Measles cases were reported from 49 states and the District of Columbia. Adults >20 years of age
accounted for 22% of cases, of which 67% were not appropriately vaccinated (unvaccinated with
vaccine indicated). Twenty-five percent of these adults with measles required >1 day of hospitaliza-
tion. A provisional total of 130 measles-associated deaths was reported in 1989 and 1990; 36 (28%) of
these were persons >20 years of age. At least 267 measles outbreaks were reported; 17 (6%) occurred
on college campuses. Two percent of reported cases were among college students or were epidemi-
ologically linked to campus outbreaks.
Encephalitis or death follows measles disease in approximately one case per 1,000. Aside from
infants, the risk of encephalitis is greatest among adult patients.
Measles illness during pregnancy increases rates of spontaneous abortion, premature labor, and
low birth weight for infants. Although cases of congenital malformation after measles infection during
pregnancy have been reported, no specific syndrome has been demonstrated.
14

Measles vaccine. Measles vaccine produces a mild or inapparent noncommunicable infection. A
single subcutaneously administered dose of live measles vaccine provides durable protection against
measles illness for >95% of susceptible children vaccinated at 15 months, extending probably for
their lifetime. The vaccine of choice is MMR.
Vaccine indications. All adults born in 1957 or later who do not have a medical contraindication
should receive one dose of measles vaccine unless they have a dated record of vaccination with at least
one dose of live measles vaccine on or after their first birthday, documentation of physician-diagnosed
disease, or laboratory evidence of immunity. Most persons born before 1957 can be considered
immune and do not need vaccination. Of all measles cases reported to CDC from 1985 through 1990,
96.3% occurred among persons born in 1957 or later. However, because a small proportion will be
susceptible, vaccine should be offered to such individuals, particularly health-care workers, if there is
reason to believe that they may be susceptible. Serologic studies of hospital workers indicate that up
to 9.3% of persons born before 1957 were not immune to measles (4,5). Ninety-seven (29%) of 341
health-care workers who developed measles in the period 1985-1989 were born before 1957 (6).
As noted above, a single dose of live measles vaccine given on or after the first birthday can be
expected to provide long-lasting immunity to measles in at least 95% of recipients. In most situations,
a high rate of vaccination resulting in 95% of the population being immune is sufficient to prevent
transmission of measles. However, in some circumstances, 5% susceptibility provides enough
nonimmune persons to sustain transmission of measles. This situation occurs most commonly in
school and college settings, where large numbers of young adults congregate. Other circumstances in
which transmission may occur despite high levels of immunity are in hospitals and other health-care
facilities and among persons traveling in places where measles is endemic. In these situations,
assuring high levels of immunity to measles among vaccinees by providing a second dose of measles
vaccine is desirable. The two-dose schedule is expected to provide protection to most persons who do
not respond to their initial vaccination.
Entrants into colleges, universities, and other institutions of post-high school education as well as
employees in health-care facilities who do not have evidence of immunity to measles (documented
physician-diagnosed measles or laboratory evidence of immunity) should be required to provide
documentation of two doses of measles vaccine on or after their first birthday. Use of MMR is preferred
for both vaccine doses to assure immunity to all three viruses. Individuals who have no documentation
of ever having received any doses of measles vaccine and who do not have other evidence of measles
immunity should be given one dose of measles vaccine on entry into college or when beginning
employment; they should be revaccinated with a second dose not less than 1 month later. If feasible,
colleges and health-care facilities may wish to extend this requirement to all students and employees.
During outbreaks of measles in schools, colleges, or health-care facilities, all persons born in 1957
or later who cannot provide evidence of receiving two doses of measles vaccine or other evidence of
measles immunity should receive one dose of measles-containing vaccine. Those persons should
receive their second dose of vaccine not less than 1 month later. Because some medical personnel who
have acquired measles in medical facilities were born before 1957, vaccination of older employees who
may have occupational exposure to measles should also be considered during outbreaks.
An estimated 600,000-900,000 persons in the United States received killed measles vaccine in the
period 1963-1967. Individuals who received killed measles vaccine, killed measles vaccine followed
within 3 months by live measles vaccine, measles vaccine of unknown type in the period 1963-1967, or
vaccine before their first birthday should be considered unvaccinated and should receive at least one
dose of live measles vaccine. If these persons are beginning college or other post-high school
education or beginning employment in a medical setting, they should receive two doses of measles
vaccine at least 1 month apart, as described above.
Because the risk of acquiring measles outside the United States is greater than the risk incurred
in the United States, travelers should be immune to measles before leaving the United States.
Consideration should be given to providing a dose of measles vaccine to persons born during or after
1957 who travel abroad, who have not previously received two doses of measles vaccine, and who do
not have other evidence of measles immunity.
Young adults who are exposed to measles and who have no or uncertain documentation of live
measles vaccination on or after their first birthday, no record of physician-diagnosed measles, and no
laboratory evidence of immunity should be vaccinated within 72 hours after exposure; vaccination is
most likely to be protective during that time. If the exposure did not result in infection, the vaccine
should induce protection against subsequent measles infection. An acceptable alternative is to use
15


## p. 16 (#158) #############################################

immune globulin (IG), which can prevent or modify infection if administered within 6 days after
exposure. This alternative is principally indicated when measles vaccine is contraindicated. IG should
not be used in an attempt to control measles outbreaks. The recommended dose of IG is 0.25 ml/kg
IM, not to exceed 15 mL. Live measles vaccine should be given 3 months after IG is administered, by
which time the passive measles antibodies should have disappeared. Because postexposure vaccina-
tion or administration of IG is not completely effective, medical personnel should be removed from
patient contact 5-21 days after exposure.
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. A temperature of 103 F (39.4 C) may develop among
approximately 5%-15% of vaccinees, usually beginning between the fifth and twelfth days after
vaccination; fever usually lasts 1-2 days and, rarely, up to 5 days.
Rashes have been reported among approximately 5% of vaccinees. Encephalitis after measles
vaccination is extremely rare, and its incidence cannot be discerned from the background incidence
rate of encephalitis of an unknown etiology. The incidence of postvaccination encephalitis is much
lower than the incidence after natural measles.
Reactions after live measles vaccination occur among 4%-55% of prior recipients of killed measles
vaccine. The reactions are generally mild, consisting of a local reaction with or without a low-grade
fever of 1-2 days duration. Such reactions can be fairly severe but are milder than atypical measles
syndrome, an illness that may affect prior recipients of killed measles vaccine who are exposed to
natural measles.
No evidence suggests increased risk from live measles vaccination among persons who are
already immune to measles as a result of either previous vaccination or natural disease.
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. Vaccination should not be postponed because of a
minor illness, such as a mild upper-respiratory infection. However, vaccination of persons with severe
febrile illnesses should be postponed until recovery. Vaccine should be given 14 days before-or
deferred for at least 6 weeks and preferably 3 months after-a person has received IG, whole blood, or
other blood products containing antibody.
Because of a theoretical risk to the developing fetus, measles vaccine should not be given to
pregnant women.
Measles vaccine also should not be given to persons who are immunocompromised as a result of
immune deficiency diseases, leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy or who are immuno-
suppressed as a result of therapy with corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation.
However, persons with leukemia who are in remission and have not received chemotherapy for at least
3 months and HIV-infected persons should be vaccinated against measles, if considered susceptible.
(See “Conditions that Compromise the Immune System" and Tables 5 and 6.)
No evidence suggests that live measles vaccine exacerbates tuberculosis. If tuberculin skin testing
is needed, the testing should be done on the day of vaccination and read 48-72 hours later. A recent
vaccinee should wait 4-6 weeks after receiving measles vaccine before a tuberculin skin test is
administered, because measles vaccination may temporarily suppress tuberculin reactivity.
Persons with a history of any sign or symptom of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling of
the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) after ingestion of eggs or receipt of
neomycin should be given measles vaccine only with extreme caution. Protocols have been developed
for vaccinating such persons ( 16 ). Persons with reactions that are not anaphylactic are not at increased
risk and can be vaccinated.
Mumps
The reported occurrence of mumps cases in the United States has decreased steadily since the
introduction of live mumps vaccine. In 1985, a record low of 2,982 cases was reported; this number
represented a 98% decline from the 185,691 cases reported in 1967, the year live mumps vaccine was
licensed. However, reported cases increased to 7,790 in 1986, followed by 12,848 cases in 1987. In 1988,
1989, and 1990, totals of 4,866, 5,712, and 5,075 cases, respectively, were reported. Largely because of
expense, mumps vaccine was not recommended by the ACIP for routine use until 1977, which led to
the development of a relatively underimmunized cohort of teenagers and young adults (17). Data from
the U.S. Immunization Survey suggest that only approximately 50% of persons of college age in 1986
had received mumps vaccine. In 1989, 38% of reported mumps cases for whom age was known
occurred among persons 15 years of age, compared with 12% in 1977.
16


## p. 17 (#159) #############################################

Although mumps disease is generally self limiting, meningeal signs may appear in up to 15% of
cases, and orchitis in 20%-30% of clinical cases among postpubertal males. Sterility is a rare sequela
of mumps orchitis among males. Unilateral sensorineural deafness occurs at a rate of one case per
20,000 cases of mumps.
Mumps vaccine. Live mumps vaccine has been available since 1967. A single dose of live mumps
vaccine administered SC provides protective and long-lasting levels of antibody in >90% of recipients.
Clinical vaccine efficacy reports range between 75% and 95%. If recipients are likely to be susceptible
to measles and/or rubella as well as to mumps, MMR is the vaccine of choice.
Vaccine indications. Mumps vaccine is indicated for all adults believed to be susceptible. Persons
should be considered susceptible to mumps unless they have documentation of physician-diagnosed
mumps, adequate immunization with live mumps vaccine on or after their first birthday, or laboratory
evidence of immunity. Most adults born before 1957 are likely to have been infected naturally and can
be considered immune, even if they did not have clinically recognizable mumps disease. Killed mumps
vaccine was available from 1950 until 1978. Persons who received killed mumps vaccine might benefit
from vaccination with live mumps vaccine. Revaccination with MMR is recommended under certain
circumstances for measles (see "Measles" section) and may also be important for mumps because
recent studies have shown that mumps can occur in highly vaccinated populations. Persons who are
unsure of their mumps disease/vaccination history should be vaccinated.
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. Parotitis and fever after vaccination have been
reported rarely. Allergic reactions including rash, pruritus, and purpura have been associated
temporally with mumps vaccination but are uncommon, usually mild, and of brief duration. The
frequency of reported central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction after mumps vaccination is not
greater than the observed background incidence rate in the general population.
Because of the recommendation to use MMR for revaccination against measles, many persons
will receive two doses of live mumps vaccine. No evidence suggests an increased risk from live mumps
vaccination among persons who are already immune to mumps as a result of either previous
vaccination or natural disease.
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. Vaccine should be given at least 14 days before, or
deferred for at least 6 weeks-and preferably 3 months, after a person has received IG, whole blood,
or other blood products containing antibody.
Because of the theoretical risk of fetal harm after administration of a live-virus vaccine to a
pregnant woman, avoiding administering mumps vaccine to pregnant women is prudent.
Mumps vaccine should not be given to persons who are immunocompromised as a result of
immune deficiency diseases, leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy or to persons who are
immunosuppressed as a result of therapy with corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, or
radiation. Mumps vaccine should be given to asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals and may be
considered for those who are symptomatic. (See "Conditions that compromise the Immune System"
and Tables 5 and 6.) Persons with a history of any sign or symptom of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g.,
hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) after ingestion of
eggs or receipt of neomycin should be vaccinated only with extreme caution. Protocols have been
developed for vaccinating persons with severe egg allergy ( 16 ). Persons with reactions that are not
anaphylactic are not at increased risk and can be vaccinated.
Rubella
Preventing fetal infection and consequent CRS are the objectives of rubella immunization. Fetal
infection occurring during the first trimester of pregnancy can lead to CRS in up to 80% of fetuses. Also,
fetal death because of miscarriage or therapeutic abortion after maternal rubella disease or exposure
during the first trimester continues to occur frequently.
The number of reported rubella cases has decreased steadily from >56,000 cases in 1969, the year
rubella vaccine was licensed, to 225 cases in 1988. Until the mid-1970s, the strategy was to vaccinate
all children; this strategy dramatically reduced the incidence of rubella but had less impact on older
age groups, resulting in an increased proportion of cases in adolescents and adults. During the period
1976-1979, >70% of the reported rubella cases occurred among persons >15 years of age. During 1980
to 1990, this percentage varied widely, reaching a low of 38% in 1988. However, a fivefold increase in
rubella incidence occurred between 1988 and 1990. Provisional data indicate that incidence rose
sharply among persons 15 years of age to approximately 57% of 931 cases (with known age) in 1990.
17


## p. 18 (#160) #############################################

A cluster of at least 11 CRS cases among infants born in 1990 was reported to the National CRS
Registry. Increased efforts to increase delivery of vaccine to college-age and older persons have led to
the current decline in the incidence rates for these age groups. However, an estimated 6%-11% of
young adults remain susceptible to rubella, and limited outbreaks continue to be reported in
universities, colleges, and places of employment-notably hospitals.
Vaccination of young children has prevented widespread epidemics of rubella and of CRS and
eventually will lead to the elimination of CRS as vaccinated cohorts enter the childbearing age.
However, increased efforts to ensure that all adults, particularly women of childbearing age, are
vaccinated will hasten the elimination of rubella and CRS in the United States. Additional aids to
eliminate rubella and CRS include achieving and maintaining high vaccination levels, maintaining
vigorous surveillance, and practicing aggressive outbreak control.
Rubella vaccine. A single SC-administered dose of live, attenuated rubella vaccine provides
long-term (probably lifetime) immunity among approximately 95% of vaccinees. Moreover, there has
been no identified transmission of vaccine virus in studies of >1,200 susceptible household contacts
of vaccinees and in >20 years of experience with live rubella vaccine. If recipients are likely to be
susceptible to measles and/or mumps as well as to rubella, MMR is the vaccine of choice.
Vaccine indications. Rubella vaccine is recommended for adults, particularly females, unless proof
of immunity is available (i.e., documented rubella vaccination on or after the first birthday or positive
results from a serologic test) or unless the vaccine is specifically contraindicated. In particular,
nonpregnant susceptible women of childbearing age should be provided rubella vaccination a) during
routine internal medicine and gynecologic outpatient care, b) during routine care in a family planning
clinic, c) after premarital screening, d) before discharge from a hospital for any reason, and e) after
childbirth or abortion. Ideally, any contact with the health-care system should be used as an
opportunity to vaccinate susceptible women. Also, evidence of rubella immunity should be required
for all persons in colleges and universities. Health-care programs in workplaces and in other places
where women of childbearing age congregate should ensure that the vaccination status of every
employee is evaluated and that rubella vaccination is made available. All hospital personnel (male and
female) who might be at risk of exposure to patients infected with rubella or who might have contact
with pregnant patients or personnel should be immune to rubella. Consideration should be given to
making rubella immunity a condition for employment. Finally, since the risk of acquiring rubella while
traveling outside the United States is greater than the risk incurred within the United States, all women
travelers, particularly those of childbearing age, should be immune before leaving the United States.
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. Up to 25% of susceptible postpubertal female
vaccinees in large-scale field trials have had arthralgia after vaccination; arthritis signs and symptoms
occur transiently among 10% of recipients. Arthralgia and transient arthritis occur more frequently and
tend to be more severe among susceptible women than among seropositive women and children.
When joint symptoms or other types of pain and paresthesias do occur, they usually begin 1-3 weeks
after vaccination, persist from 1 day to 3 weeks, and rarely recur. Adults with joint problems usually
have not had to disrupt work activities. Sporadic cases of persistent joint symptoms among susceptible
vaccinees, primarily adult women, have been reported. Although one group of investigators has
reported the frequency of chronic joint symptoms and signs among adult women to be as high as
5%-11% (18,19), other data from the United States and experience from other countries that use the
RA 27/3 strain suggest that such phenomena are rare. In comparative studies, the frequency of chronic
joint complaints is substantially higher after natural infection than after vaccination (19). Complaints
of transient peripheral neuritis, such as paresthesias and pain in the arms and legs, have occurred very
rarely and only among susceptible vaccinees; these symptoms rarely persist.
Because a tu dose schedule of MMR is being implemented in the United States, some persons
will receive two doses of rubella vaccine. There is no conclusive evidence of any increased risk of the
reactions described above for persons who are already immune when vaccinated.
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. Rubella vaccine should be given at least 14 days
before administration of IG or deferred for at least 6 weeks-and preferably 3 months-after adminis-
tration. On the other hand, previous administration of whole blood or other blood products containing
antibody (e.g., human anti-Rho (D] IG) does not interfere with an immune response and is not a
contraindication to postpartum vaccination. However, in this situation, serologic testing should be
done 6-8 weeks after vaccination to assure that seroconversion has occurred.
18


## p. 19 (#161) #############################################

Rubella vaccine should not be given to pregnant women or to those likely to become pregnant
within 3 months after receiving the vaccine. Through 1988, CDC monitored prospectively 305
susceptible pregnant women who had received rubella vaccine within 3 months before or after
conception and carried their pregnancies to term. Ninety-four received Cendehill or HPV-77, 210
received RA 27/3, and one received an unknown strain of vaccine. None of the infants had
malformations compatible with CRS. The ACIP believes that the risk of vaccine-associated malforma-
tion is so small as to be negligible. Although a final decision must rest with the individual patient and
her physician, the ACIP believes that rubella vaccination during pregnancy should not ordinarily be a
reason to recommend interruption of pregnancy.
Because of the theoretical risk to the fetus, reasonable precautions should be taken before women
of childbearing age are vaccinated. These precautions include a) asking women if they are pregnant,
b) excluding those who say they are, and c) explaining the theoretical risks of the vaccine to the others
and counseling them not to become pregnant for 3 months after vaccination. If a pregnant woman is
vaccinated or if a woman becomes pregnant within 3 months after vaccination, she should be
counseled on the theoretical risks to the fetus.
Rubella vaccine should not be given to persons who are immunocompromised as a result of
immune deficiency diseases, leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy or who are immuno-
suppressed as a result of therapy with corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation.
HIV infection is an exception; rubella vaccine should be given to asymptomatic HIV-infected persons
and may be considered for those who are symptomatic. (See "Conditions that compromise the
Immune System” and Tables 5 and 6.)
Rubella vaccine is prepared in human diploid cell cultures and has rarely been reported to be
associated with allergic reactions. The vaccine does contain trace amounts of neomycin to which
patients may be allergic. Persons with a history of any sign or symptom of an anaphylactic reaction
(e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) after receipt
of neomycin should not receive rubella vaccine. Persons with reactions to neomycin that are not
anaphylactic are not at increased risk and can be vaccinated. Rubella vaccine does not contain
penicillin.
Smallpox (Vaccinia)
In May 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the world free of smallpox (vaccinia).
A smallpox vaccination certificate is not required by any country as a condition of entry for
international travelers. In May 1983, the distribution of vaccine for civilian use in the United States was
discontinued.
Vaccine indications. Only laboratory personnel working with orthopox viruses and certain health-
care workers involved in clinical trials of vaccinia recombinant vaccines may need to be given smallpox
vaccine. Otherwise, there are no indications for its use in civilian populations.
No evidence suggests that smallpox vaccination has therapeutic value in the treatment of
recurrent herpes simplex infection, warts, or any other disease. Smallpox vaccine should never be
used therapeutically for these or any other conditions.
When indicated, smallpox vaccination should be given every 10 years. For advice on vaccine
administration and contraindications, contact the CDC Drug Service, Building 1, Room 1259, CDC,
Atlanta, GA 30333, telephone: 404-639-3356, or the Division of Immunization, CDC Mailstop (E05),
Atlanta, GA 30333, telephone: 404-639-1870.
Varicella Zoster
Most adults (85%-95%) with negative or unknown histories of varicella (chickenpox) are likely to be
immune. Primary varicella can be more severe among adults than it is among normal (immunocom-
petent) children; however, the risk of serious complications among normal adults is substantially less
than it is among those who are immunocompromised. Live, attenuated varicella-zoster vaccine may be
licensed for use in normal children in the near future. Its potential use among adults, particularly
health-care workers, has not been defined.
Yellow Fever
Cases of yellow fever are reported only from Africa and South America. Two forms of yellow
fever-urban and jungle-are distinguishable epidemiologically. Clinically and etiologically, the two
forms are identical.
19


## p. 20 (#162) #############################################

Urban yellow fever is an epidemic viral disease transmitted from infected to susceptible persons by
the Aedes aegypti mosquito. In areas where the Ae. aegypti mosquito has been eliminated or
suppressed, urban yellow fever has disappeared. However, periodic reinfestations of some countries
in Central and South America have occurred in recent years, and other countries remain infested. In
West Africa, an Ae. aegypti -transmitted epidemic involving an urban population occurred as recently
as 1987.
Jungle yellow fever is an enzootic viral disease transmitted among nonhuman hosts by a variety of
mosquito vectors. Only in forested areas of South America and forest-savannah zones of tropical Africa
has it been observed, but it occasionally extends into Central America and the island of Trinidad. In
South America, 100-300 cases are recognized annually, mainly among persons with occupational
exposure in forested areas; the disease is, however, believed to be greatly underreported. In Africa,
sporadic endemic cases and epidemics that affect thousands of persons are spread by forest mosquito
vectors. The cycle of jungle yellow fever may be active but unrecognized in forested areas of countries
within the endemic yellow fever zone (Figure 1).
Yellow fever vaccine. The yellow fever vaccine available in the United States is an attenuated,
live-virus vaccine prepared from the 170 strain of virus grown in chick embryos. Immunity is induced
by a single SC injection of 0.5 mL of reconstituted vaccine and persists for > 10 years.
Yellow fever vaccines must be approved by WHO and administered at an approved Yellow Fever
Vaccination Center. Centers can be identified by contacting state and local health departments.
Vaccinees should have an International Certificate of Vaccination filled out, dated, signed, and
validated with the stamp of the center where the vaccine is given. Vaccine must be received 10 days
to 10 years before travel for the certificate to be valid.
Vaccine indications. Vaccination is recommended for persons traveling or living in areas in which
yellow fever infection occurs-currently parts of Africa and Central and South America. Information on
known or probably infected areas is published annually in Health Information for International Travel.
Countries currently reporting yellow fever are noted biweekly in Summary of Health Information for
International Travel (see page 8). All state health departments and many county and city health
departments receive these publications. The actual areas of yellow fever activity far exceed the zones
officially reported to be infected. Vaccination is also recommended for laboratory personnel who might
be exposed to virulent yellow fever virus.
Booster doses are needed at 10-year intervals.
Some countries, especially in Africa, require evidence of vaccination from all entering travelers.
Other countries may waive the requirements for travelers coming from noninfected areas and staying
<2 weeks. Some countries require a traveler, even if only in transit, to have a valid certificate if the
traveler has visited any country thought to harbor yellow fever virus. Requirements of individual
countries may change, and the most current information is published biweekly in Summary of Health
Information for International Travel and summarized annually in Health Information for International
Travel (see page 8).
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. Reactions to 17D yellow fever vaccine are generally
mild. From 2% to 5% of vaccinees have mild headache, myalgia, low-grade fever, or other minor
symptoms 5-10 days after vaccination. Fewer than 0.2% curtail regular activities. Immediate hyper-
sensitivity reactions, characterized by rash, urticaria, and/or asthma, are extremely uncommon and
occur principally among persons with a history of egg allergy. Although >34 million doses of vaccines
have been distributed, only two cases of encephalitis temporally associated with vaccinations have
been reported in the United States; in one fatal case, 17D virus was isolated from the brain.
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. Yellow fever vaccine should not be given to persons
who are immunocompromised as a result of immune deficiency diseases (including symptomatic HIV
infection), leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy, or to persons who are immunosup-
pressed as a result of therapy with corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation. (See
“Conditions that Compromise the Immune System.") Persons who have asymptomatic HIV infection
and who cannot avoid potential exposure to yellow fever virus should be offered the choice of
vaccination.
Although specific information is not available on adverse effects of yellow fever vaccine on the
developing fetus, avoiding vaccination of pregnant women and advising that they postpone travel to
areas where yellow fever occurs until after delivery seems prudent. Pregnant women who must travel
to areas in which the risk of yellow fever is high should be vaccinated. The risk of yellow fever infection
20


## p. 21 (#163) #############################################

far outweighs the small theoretical risk to mother and fetus from vaccination in such circumstances.
However, if international travel regulations constitute the only reason to vaccinate a pregnant woman
or a patient hypersensitive to eggs, efforts should be made to obtain a letter of waiver from a physician
clearly stating the contraindication to vaccination. Ideally, this letter should be written on letterhead
stationery and bear the stamp used by health departments and official immunization centers to
validate the International Certificates of Vaccination. Under these conditions, travelers should obtain
specific, authoritative advice from the country or countries they plan to visit. The countries' embassies
or consulates may be contacted and a letter substantiating the waiver of requirements should be
obtained
Because live yellow fever vaccine is produced in chick embryos, persons with a history of any
signs or symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty
breathing, hypotension, or shock) after eating eggs should not receive yellow fever vaccine. If
vaccination of an individual with a questionable history of egg hypersensitivity is considered essential
because of a high risk of exposure, an intradermal (ID) test dose may be administered under close
medical supervision. Specific directions for skin testing are found in the package insert.
Some data have indicated that persons given yellow fever and cholera vaccines simultaneously or
1-3 weeks apart had lower than normal antibody responses to both vaccines. Unless there are time
constraints, cholera and yellow fever vaccines should be administered at a minimum interval of
3 weeks. If the vaccines cannot be administered at least 3 weeks apart, they can be administered
simultaneously or at any time within the 3-week interval.
Yellow fever vaccine may be given simultaneously with measles, BCG, or hepatitis B vaccines, as
well as with IG.
Both Live-Virus and Inactivated-Virus Vaccines
Poliomyelitis
The risk of poliomyelitis is very small in the United States; however, epidemics could occur if the
high immunity level of the general population is not maintained by vaccinating children routinely or if
wild poliovirus is introduced into susceptible populations in communities with low immunization
levels. In the United States, inapparent infection with wild poliovirus strains no longer contributes
significantly to establishing or maintaining immunity. Most adults are already immune.
Poliovirus vaccines. Two types of poliovirus vaccines are currently licensed in the United States:
OPV and elPV. A primary vaccination series with either vaccine produces immunity to all three types
of poliovirus in >95% of recipients. The primary series of OPV consists of three doses: two doses given
6-8 weeks apart and a third dose given at least 6 weeks and customarily 12 months after the second.
The primary series for elPV consists of three doses: two doses each given 4-8 weeks apart and a third
dose given 6-12 months after the second. A primary vaccine series need not be given to adults living
in the United States who have not had a primary series as children. However, for adults who have not
had a primary series and who are at greater risk of exposure than the general population to wild
polioviruses because of foreign travel or health occupation, elPV is preferred because the risk of
OPV-associated paralysis is slightly higher among adults than among children. Poliovirus vaccine is
not routinely recommended for persons older than high school age (>18 years old).
Vaccine indications. Travelers to areas where wild poliovirus is epidemic or endemic should have
completed a primary series of poliovirus vaccine. For previously unvaccinated adults, elPV is indicated.
However, if <4 weeks is available before protection is needed, a single dose of OPV or elPV is
recommended. Travelers who have previously received less than a full primary course of OPV or IPV
should be given the remaining required doses of either vaccine, regardless of the interval since the last
dose and the type of vaccine previously received. Travelers to developing countries who have
previously completed a primary series of OPV should receive a single dose of OPV. Those who have
previously received a primary series of IPV should receive a dose of either OPV or elPV. The need for
further doses of either vaccine has not been established.
Health-care personnel in close contact with patients who may be excreting wild polioviruses and
laboratory personnel handling specimens that may contain wild polioviruses should have completed
a primary series of poliovirus vaccine. Because of the slightly increased risk to adults of vaccine-
associated paralysis after OPV administration, elPV is indicated; also, virus may be shed after receipt
of OPV vaccine and may inadvertently expose susceptible immunocompromised contacts to live
vaccine virus.
21


## p. 22 (#164) #############################################

Vaccine adverse reactions
Inactivated poliovirus vaccine. No serious side effects of currently available elPV have been
documented. Because elPV contains trace amounts of streptomycin and neomycin, hypersensitivity
reactions are possible among persons sensitive to these antibiotics. Persons with signs and symptoms
of an anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling of mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension,
or shock) after receipt of streptomycin or neomycin should not receive elPV. Persons with reactions
that are not anaphylactic are not at increased risk and may be vaccinated.
Oral poliovirus vaccine. In rare instances, administration of OPV has been associated with
paralysis among healthy recipients and their contacts. Although the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic
poliomyelitis is extremely small for immunologically normal vaccinees (approximately one case per
1.4 million first doses distributed and one case per 41.5 million subsequent doses) and for their
susceptible immunologically normal household contacts (approximately one case per 1.9 million first
doses distributed and one case per 13.8 million subsequent doses), vaccinees should be informed of
this risk (20).
Vaccine precautions and contraindications
Inactivated poliovirus vaccine. No convincing evidence of adverse effects of elPV for the pregnant
woman or developing fetus exists; regardless, theoretically vaccination of pregnant women should be
avoided. However, if immediate protection against poliomyelitis is needed, OPV, not elPV, is
recommended.
Oral poliovirus vaccine. Unlike other live-virus vaccines that are administered parenterally, OPV is
administered orally. IG and other antibody-containing blood products do not appear to interfere with
the immune response to OPV.
OPV should not be administered to persons who are or may be immunocompromised as a result
of immune deficiency diseases, HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy or to
persons who are or may be immunosuppressed as a result of therapy with corticosteroids, alkylating
drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation. (See "Conditions that compromise the Immune System."') If polio
vaccination is indicated for immunosuppressed patients, their household members, or other close
contacts, these persons should be given elPV rather than OPV. Although OPV has not been harmful
when administered to asymptomatic HIV-infected children, elPV is the vaccine of choice if the patient
is known or suspected to be infected. The use of elPV not only eliminates any theoretical risk to the
vaccinee but also prevents the possibility of vaccine virus spread to immunocompromised close
contacts. Although a protective immune response cannot be assured in the immunocompromised
patient, some protection may be provided.
OPV should not be used for vaccinating household contacts of patients immunocompromised as
a result of immune deficiency disease, HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy
or for vaccinating patients immunosuppressed as a result of therapy with corticosteroids, alkylating
drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation. If protection is indicated, elPV should be used for vaccinating
household contacts of such patients. OPV should not be given to anyone in a family with a known
family history of immunodeficiency until the immune status of all family members is documented.
When children in the household receive OPV, adults who are not adequately vaccinated against
poliomyelitis are at a very small risk of contracting OPV-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. Because of
the overriding importance of ensuring prompt and complete vaccination of the child and the extreme
rarity of OPV-associated disease in contacts of vaccinees, the ACIP recommends the administration of
OPV to a child, regardless of the poliovirus-vaccine status of adult household contacts. This is the
standard practice in the United States. The responsible adult should be informed of the small risk
involved and of the precautions to be taken, such as hand washing after changing a diaper. An
acceptable alternative, if there is strong assurance that ultimate, full vaccination of the child will not be
jeopardized or unduly delayed, is to vaccinate adults with elPV or OPV, as appropriate to their
immunity status, before giving OPV to the child.
Inactivated-Virus Vaccines
Hepatitis B Virus Infection
The estimated lifetime risk of acquiring HBV infection in the United States is approximately 5% for
the population as a whole but may approach 100% for the highest risk groups. Annually, an estimated
300,000 HBV infections occur in the United States, leading to approximately 10,000 hospitalizations
and 250 deaths due to fulminant hepatitis B.
22


## p. 23 (#165) #############################################

In 1988, 89% of HBV cases for which the patient's age was known occurred among persons >20
years of age. Between 6% and 10% of adults with HBV infection become carriers. The United States
currently has 750,000-1,000,000 carriers. Chronic active hepatitis occurs among an estimated 25% of
carriers. Each year in the United States, approximately 4,000 persons die of HBV-related cirrhosis and
800 of HBV-related liver cancer.
Hepatitis B vaccine. Two types of HB vaccines are currently licensed in the United States.
Plasma-derived HB vaccine consists of a suspension of inactivated, alum-adsorbed 22-nm HBsAg
particles that have been purified from human plasma. Although still available, plasma-derived vaccine
is no longer being produced in the United States. Currently licensed recombinant HB vaccines are
produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (common baker's yeast), into which a plasmid containing the
gene for the HBsAg has been inserted. These vaccines contain >95% HBsAg protein.
Dosages of vaccines vary with manufacturer and age of the recipient. Package inserts should be
consulted for proper dosages. Both types of vaccines are given as three-dose series, with the first two
doses given 1 month apart, and the third dose 5 months after the second. An alternative schedule for
one vaccine, with three doses 1 month apart followed by a fourth dose 12 months after the first, has
been approved for postexposure prophylaxis or for more rapid induction of immunity. However, no
clear evidence that this regimen offers greater protection than the standard schedule exists. Duration
of protection from HB vaccines is at least 7 years among healthy adults; the possible need for booster
doses will be assessed as further information becomes available.
Because the prevalence of HBV infection varies widely among various population groups,
serologic screening to detect susceptible individuals before vaccination may or may not be cost
effective. Cost-effectiveness depends on the known or expected prevalence of immune individuals in
the target population, the cost of screening, and the cost of HB vaccine. Postvaccination testing for
immunity is not recommended routinely but is advised for persons whose subsequent management
depends on knowing their immune status (dialysis patients and staff) and for those in whom
suboptimal response is anticipated (persons with HIV infection and those who have received vaccine
in the buttock). When indicated, such testing should be done within 1-6 months after completing
vaccination. Postvaccination testing should also be considered for health-care workers at risk of
needlestick exposures. If such testing demonstrates an antibody level <10 mlU/mL, revaccination with
one or more doses should be considered.
Vaccine indications. Vaccination is recommended for adults at increased risk of occupational,
social, family, environmental, or illness-related exposure to HBV. These include homosexual males,
injecting drug users, heterosexual persons with multiple partners or other sexually transmitted
diseases, household and sexual contacts of HBV carriers, workers in health-related and public-safety
occupations requiring frequent exposure to blood, residents and staff of institutions for the develop-
mentally disabled, hemodialysis patients, recipients of factor VIII or IX concentrates, and morticians
and their assistants. Inmates in some long-term correctional facilities may also be candidates for
vaccination.
Vaccination should also be considered for persons who plan to reside for >6 months in areas with
high levels of endemic HBV and who will have close contact with the local population and for travelers
intending a short stay who are likely to have contact with blood from or sexual contact with residents
of areas with high levels of endemic disease (particularly areas of eastern Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa). Such persons should allow 6 months before travel to complete the HB vaccine primary series.
The alternative four-dose schedule may offer better protection if three doses can be given before
travel.
HB vaccine is intended primarily for preexposure prophylaxis; however, it has been recom-
mended for postexposure use in certain situations, particularly for nonimmune persons who belong to
a high-risk group for whom preexposure administration of vaccine is recommended (21 ). HB vaccine,
in combination with HBIG, provides sustained protective levels of antibody and obviates the need for
a second dose of HBIG in such exposures. Therefore, a normal series of HB vaccine, combined with a
single dose (0.06 mL/kg or 5 mL for adults) of HBIG given at a different site, is recommended for
postexposure prophylaxis of nonimmune (and previously unvaccinated) health workers after acciden-
tal percutaneous or mucous-membrane exposure to blood containing HBsAg, and after all sexual
exposure to HBsAg-positive persons if the first dose of vaccine can be administered within 14 days of
sexual exposure or if sexual contact with the infected person will continue.
23


## p. 24 (#166) #############################################

Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. The most common side effect observed after
vaccination with each of the available vaccines has been soreness at the injection site. Postvaccination
surveillance for 3 years after licensure of the plasma-derived vaccine showed an association of
borderline significance between Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and receipt of the first vaccine dose
(22). The rate of this occurrence was very low (0.5/100,000 vaccinees), and, even if a true side effect,
was more than compensated for by disease prevented by the vaccine. Such postvaccination
surveillance information is not available for the recombinant HB vaccines. Early concerns about safety
of plasma-derived vaccine, particularly the concern that infectious agents such as HIV present in the
donor plasma pools might contaminate the final product, have proved to be unfounded.
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. Pregnancy should not be considered a contraindica-
tion to vaccinating women who are otherwise candidates for receiving HB vaccine. Although data are
not available on the safety of the vaccine for the developing fetus, HB vaccine contains only
noninfectious HBsAg particles and should pose no risk to the fetus. In contrast, HBV infection in a
pregnant woman may result in a severe disease for the mother and chronic infection for the newborn.
Influenza
Influenza viruses have continually demonstrated the ability to cause major epidemics of respiratory
disease. High attack rates of acute illness and the frequent occurrence of lower respiratory tract
complications usually result in dramatic rises in visits to physicians' offices and hospital emergency
rooms. Furthermore, influenza frequently infects individuals who, because of their age or underlying
health status, are poorly able to cope with the disease and often require medical attention, including
hospitalization. Such persons are considered, medically, to be at “high risk” in epidemics. In one recent
study, for example, rates of hospitalization for adults with high-risk medical conditions increased
during major epidemics by approximately twofold to fivefold in different age groups, reaching a
maximum rate of about 800/100,000 population.
Influenza epidemics cause excess mortality that is attributable not only to influenza pneumonia but
also to cardiopulmonary disease. Nineteen times in the period 1957-1986 epidemics have been
associated with >10,000 excess deaths. Approximately 80%-90% of the excess deaths attributed to
pneumonia and influenza were among persons >65 years of age during major epidemics.
Influenza has its greatest impact when new strains appear against which most of the population
lacks immunity. In these circumstances (e.g., 1957 and 1968), pandemics occur. During pandemics,
one-fourth or more of the U.S. population has been affected over a period of 2-3 months.
Because the proportion of elderly persons in the United States is increasing and because age and its
associated chronic diseases are risk factors for severe influenza illness, the toll of influenza may also
increase unless control measures are used more vigorously than in the past.
Influenza vaccine. Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes on the basis of two antigens:
hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Three subtypes of hemagglutinin (H1, H2, H3) and two
subtypes of neuraminidases (N1, N2) are recognized among influenza A viruses that have caused
widespread human disease. Immunity to these antigens, especially hemagglutinin, reduces the
likelihood of infection and the severity of disease if a person does become infected. However, sufficient
antigenic variation (antigenic drift) within the same subtype over time may exist, so that infection or
vaccination with one strain may not induce immunity to distantly related strains of the same subtype.
Although influenza B viruses have shown much more antigenic stability than influenza A viruses,
antigenic variation does occur. As a consequence, the antigenic characteristics of current strains
provide the basis for selecting virus strains to be included in the vaccine for a given year.
The potency of present vaccines is such that nearly all vaccinated young adults develop
hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers that usually protect them against infection by strains like
those in the vaccine, and often by related variants that emerge. The elderly, the very young, and
patients with certain chronic diseases may develop lower antibody titers after vaccination than do
young adults. Under these circumstances, influenza vaccine may be more effective in preventing
lower-respiratory-tract involvement or other complications of influenza than in preventing upper-
respiratory-tract involvement. Influenza vaccine will not prevent primary illnesses caused by other
respiratory pathogens.
Vaccine indications. Use of inactivated influenza vaccine is the single most important measure in
preventing and attenuating influenza infection. Since 1963, annual vaccination against influenza has
been recommended for individuals at high risk of lower-respiratory-tract complications and death after
influenza infection (i.e., the elderly and persons with chronic disorders of the cardiovascular,

pulmonary, and/or renal systems; metabolic diseases; severe anemia; and/or compromised immune
function, inciuding HIV infection). These groups have been identified primarily by review of death
certificate data, supported by hospital-based or population-based studies. Within each broadly defined
high-risk category, however, some persons are more likely than others to suffer severe complications
from influenza infection.
Among nursing home residents, chronic diseases and other debilitating conditions are common,
and influenza can often be spread explosively, with attack rates as high as 60% and case-fatality ratios
>30%.
Medical personnel, while working, may transmit influenza infections to their high-risk patients
while they themselves are incubating an infection, undergoing a subclinical infection, or having mild
symptoms. Nosocomial outbreaks of influenza have been reported. The potential for introducing
influenza to a high-risk group, such as patients with severely compromised cardiopulmonary or
immune systems or infants in neonatal intensive care units, should be reduced by targeted vaccination
programs of medical personnel.
On the basis of these observations, the previous, broadly defined high-risk adult groups have been
assigned further priority for receiving vaccine so that special efforts can be directed at providing
vaccine to those who may derive the greatest benefit.
Groups at increased risk for influenza-related complications. To maximize protection of high-risk
persons, both the persons at risk and their close contacts should be targeted for organized vaccination
programs. These include the following:
1. Persons >65 years of age.
2. Residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities housing patients of any age with
chronic medical conditions.
3. Adults and children with chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems,
including children with asthma.
4. Adults and children who have required regular medical follow-up or hospitalization during the
preceding year because of chronic metabolic diseases (including diabetes mellitus), renal
dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression (including immunosuppression
caused by medications).
5. Children and teenagers (ages 6 months-18 years) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy
and therefore may be at risk of developing Reye syndrome after an influenza infection.
Groups potentially capable of transmitting influenza to high-risk persons. Caregivers of or
household members attending high-risk persons can transmit influenza infections to them while they
themselves are undergoing subclinical or symptomatic infection. Some high-risk persons (e.g., the
elderly, transplant recipients, or persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS]) can have
relatively low antibody responses to influenza vaccine. Efforts to protect them against influenza may
be improved by reducing the chances that their care providers may expose them to influenza.
Therefore, the following groups should be vaccinated:
1. Physicians, nurses, and other personnel in hospital and outpatient-care settings who have
contact with high-risk patients in all age groups, including infants.
2. Employees of nursing homes and chronic-care facilities who have contact with patients or
residents.
3. Providers of home care to high-risk persons (e.g., visiting nurses, volunteer workers).
4. Household members (including children) of high-risk persons.
In addition, influenza vaccine may be offered to persons who provide essential community
service, to any adult who wishes to reduce the likelihood of an influenza infection, to the elderly, or to
those with high-risk conditions who travel to areas with active influenza disease.
Vaccination of other groups. Pregnant women who have other medical conditions that increase
their risks for complications from influenza should be vaccinated, as the vaccine is considered safe for
pregnant women. Administering the vaccine after the first trimester is a reasonable precaution to
minimize any concern over the theoretical risk of teratogenicity. However, delaying vaccination of
pregnant women who have high-risk conditions and who will still be in the first trimester of pregnancy
when the influenza season begins is undesirable.
Little information exists on the frequency and severity of influenza illness among HIV-infected
persons, but recent reports suggest that symptoms may be prolonged and the risk of complications
25


## p. 26 (#168) #############################################

increased for this high-risk group. Therefore, vaccination is a prudent precaution and will result in
protective antibody levels among many recipients. However, the antibody response to vaccine may be
low in persons with advanced HIV-related illnesses. A booster dose of vaccine has not improved the
immune response for these individuals.
Strategies for implementing influenza vaccine recommendations. Effective programs for giving
influenza vaccine are needed in nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities, in physicians' offices,
and in hospital settings. Residents of nursing homes and chronic-care facilities should receive routine
annual vaccinations. Other adult high-priority groups should receive influenza vaccine at the time of
regular medical follow-ups in the autumn or should be notified to come in specifically to receive the
vaccine. Patients with high-risk conditions who are hospitalized during the autumn should be
considered for influenza vaccine before being discharged from the hospital. The target groups for
receiving influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine overlap considerably. These vaccines
can be given at the same time at different sites without an increase in side effects or compromise in
immunogenicity; however, influenza vaccine is given annually, whereas pneumococcal polysaccha-
ride vaccine is not given more often than every 6 years to adults.
Amantadine hydrochloride, an antiviral drug, can prevent influenza A or be used therapeutically
to reduce symptoms of influenza A infections. It is not a substitute for vaccine. Specific circumstances
in which amantadine prophylaxis is recommended are described in the ACIP recommendations on
prevention and control of influenza. (See Appendix 1.)
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. Vaccines used in recent years have been associated
with infrequent reactions. Local redness or induration for 1 or 2 days at the site of injection has
reportedly developed among fewer than one-third of vaccinees.
Systemic reactions have been of two types. First, malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms
of toxicity, although infrequent, most often affect those who have had no experience with the influenza
virus antigens contained in the vaccine. These reactions, which begin 6-12 hours after vaccination and
persist 1-2 days, are usually attributed to the influenza antigens (even though the virus is inactivated)
and constitute most of the systemic side effects of influenza vaccination.
Second, immediate, presumably allergic responses, such as flare and wheal or various respiratory
tract symptoms of hypersensitivity, occur extremely rarely after influenza vaccination. These symp-
toms probably result from sensitivity to some vaccine component-most likely residual egg protein.
Although current influenza vaccines contain only a small quantity of egg protein, vaccine can induce
hypersensitivity reactions on rare occasions. Unlike the 1976 swine influenza vaccine, vaccines used
subsequently have not been clearly associated with an increased frequency of GBS.
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. Persons with a history of any signs or symptoms of an
anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension,
or shock) after eating eggs should not be given inactivated influenza vaccine.
Persons with acute febrile illnesses normally should not be vaccinated until their symptoms have
abated.
Rabies
Although rabies rarely affects humans in the United States, approximately 18,000 persons receive
rabies vaccine every year for postexposure prophylaxis, and an additional 10,000 persons receive
preexposure prophylaxis. The likelihood of human exposure to rabies from domestic animals has
decreased greatly in recent years. In every year since 1976, >85% of all reported cases of animal rabies
have been among wild animals, the most important source of possible infection for humans in the
United States. However, for persons traveling overseas to developing countries with endemic rabies,
the dog remains the animal most likely to transmit the disease.
Rabies vaccine. Two inactivated rabies vaccines are currently licensed for preexposure and
postexposure prophylaxis in the United States. HDCV is supplied in two forms: a) for IM administration
(single-dose vials containing lyophilized vaccine that is reconstituted in the vial with the accompanying
diluent to a final volume of 1.0 mL just before administration), and b) for ID administration (single-dose
syringes containing lyophilized vaccine that is reconstituted in the syringe to a volume of 0.1 mL just
before administration).
Rabies vaccine adsorbed (RVA), prepared from the Kissling strain of rabies virus adapted to fetal
rhesus lung diploid cell culture, was licensed in 1988. Developed and distributed by the Biologics
Products Program, Michigan Department of Public Health, RVA is currently available only to residents
of the state of Michigan.
26


## p. 27 (#169) #############################################

Rabies vaccine derived from human diploid cell developed in the United States (Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories, WYVAC) was recalled from the market in 1985 and is no longer available.
Preexposure prophylaxis, consisting of three 1.0-ml injections of HDCV or RVA, should be given
IM (deltoid), one each on days 0, 7, and 28. Alternatively, using the specially designed syringe, three
0.1-mL injections of HDCV (but not RVA) may be given ID in the deltoid on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28 (23).
The proper postexposure rabies prophylaxis regimen depends on whether the person has had
previous preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis. Persons who a) have previously received postex-
posure prophylaxis with HDCV or RVA, b) have received a three-dose IM preexposure regimen of HDCV
or RVA, C) have received a three-dose ID preexposure regimen of HDCV in the United States, or d) have
a previously documented adequate rabies titer should receive two 1-ML IM doses of HDCV-one dose
each on days 0 and 3. Human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) is not recommended in these
circumstances. Persons not meeting the above criteria should be treated with a single 20-1U/kg dose of
HRIG and five 1-mL doses IM of HDCV-one each on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. HRIG should be
administered at the beginning of HDCV postexposure prophylaxis but can be given up to the eighth
day after the first dose of HDCV was given. The HRIG dose should be divided. Up to half should
infiltrate the area of the wound, if possible, and the rest should be administered IM, but never in the
same site or in the same syringe as HDCV. Only IM administration of HDCV is indicated for
postexposure prophylaxis. Among adults, only the deltoid area is acceptable for vaccine administra-
tion.
Vaccine indications. Preexposure immunization should be considered for high-risk groups: animal
handlers, certain laboratory workers and field personnel, and persons planning to spend more than
1 month in areas of countries where rabies is a constant threat. Persons whose vocations or avocations
bring them into contact with potentially rabid animals, including skunks, raccoons, and bats, should
also be considered for preexposure vaccination. Persons with continuing risk of exposure should
receive a booster dose every 2 years, or they should have their serum tested for rabies antibody every
2 years and, if the titer is inadequate, receive a booster dose. If substantial risk of exposure to rabies
exists, preexposure rabies prophylaxis may be indicated during pregnancy.
The decision to provide postexposure antirabies treatment should include the following
considerations:
1. Type of exposure. Rabies is transmitted primarily by the bite of infected animals. Aerosols or
the introduction of saliva or other potentially infectious material from a rabid animal into open
cuts or wounds in the skin or via mucous membranes also may transmit rabies.
2. Species of biting animal. Carnivorous wild animals (especially skunks, raccoons, and foxes) and
bats are most commonly infected with rabies in the United States. Elsewhere in the world,
dogs, cats, carnivorous wildlife, and bats are the major vectors. The likelihood that domestic
cats or dogs in the United States will be infected varies from region to region. Most rodents,
such as squirrels, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, rats and mice, and lagomorphs (including
rabbits and hares) are rarely infected. However, woodchucks are an exception and have
accounted for 70% of rabies cases among rodents reported to CDC between 1971 and 1988. The
state or local health department should be consulted in cases of rodent bites before
postexposure prophylaxis is initiated.
3. Circumstances of a biting incident. An unprovoked bite indicates a rabid animal more than a
provoked bite.
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. Local reactions, such as pain, erythema, and swelling
or itching at the injection site, are reported by up to 74% of recipients. Mild systemic reactions, such
as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness, are reported by between 5% and
40% of recipients. After primary vaccination, systemic allergic reactions ranging from hives to
anaphylaxis occur among an estimated 11 of 10,000 vaccinees. After booster doses, mild immune-
complex-like hypersensitivity reactions consisting of hives, itching, and angioedema occur 2-21 days
later among approximately 6% of recipients and are the most frequently reported allergic reactions
(24). Fewer than 1% of persons develop such reactions after primary administration of HDCV. Two
cases of neurologic illness resembling GBS that resolved without sequelae in 12 weeks have been
reported-as well as a number of different subacute central and peripheral nervous system disorders
temporally associated with HDCV vaccine, but a causal relationship has not been established (25).
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents
can interfere with the development of active immunity and should not be administered during
27


## p. 28 (#170) #############################################

preexposure therapy. When rabies postexposure prophylaxis is administered to persons known or
suspected of being immunosuppressed or to those who are receiving steroids or immunosuppressive
therapy, the serum should be tested to ensure an adequate rabies antibody response.
Chloroquine phosphate administered for malaria chemoprophylaxis and unidentified factors
among persons living in developing countries may interfere with the antibody response to HDCV
among persons traveling to developing countries (26). Among persons receiving preexposure
prophylaxis and chloroquine in preparation for travel to an area in which rabies is enzootic, the
administration of the 0.1-mL dose ID should be initiated at least 1 month before travel to allow the
three-dose series to be completed before antimalarial prophylaxis begins. If this is not possible, the
1.0-ml dose should be administered IM.
If a person experiences a possible anaphylactic reaction (e.g., hives, swelling of the mouth and
throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, or shock) after receiving HDCV, no further preexposure doses
of HDCV should be given. In contrast, if a person needing postexposure therapy has had a previous
anaphylactic reaction to HDCV or has such a reaction during the postexposure course, public health
officials should be contacted to determine if HDCV therapy should continue. The person should receive
the subsequent doses in an appropriate medical setting.
Inactivated-Bacteria Vaccines
Cholera
Cholera continues to be a health risk in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Persons who follow the usual
tourist itinerary and who use tourist accommodations in countries affected by cholera are at virtually
no risk of infection. The traveler's best protection against cholera is avoiding food and ater that might
be contaminated.
Cholera vaccine. The vaccine may be administered as a 0.5-mL dose SC or IM or as a 0.2-mL dose
ID. Although a single dose of vaccine is sufficient for entry into most countries, some countries may
require evidence of a complete primary series of two doses given 1 week to >1 month apart, or a
booster dose within 6 months before arrival.
The currently available cholera vaccine has been shown in field trials to be only approximately
50% effective in preventing clinical illness for a period of 3-6 months. The vaccine does not prevent
transmission of infection. The risk of cholera to most U.S. travelers is so low that the vaccination is of
dubious benefit. WHO no longer recommends cholera vaccination for travel to or from cholera-infected
areas. However, some countries affected or threatened by cholera may require evidence of cholera
vaccination as a condition of entry. Current information on cholera-vaccination requirements of
individual countries is published annually in Health Information for International Travel (see page 8).
All state health departments and many county and city health departments receive this publication.
Travelers to countries with cholera-vaccination requirements should have an International Certificate
of Vaccination completed, dated, signed, and validated, showing receipt of the vaccine 6 days-
6 months before entry into the country. Most city, county, and state health departments can validate
certificates. Failure to secure validation may cause travelers to be revaccinated or quarantined.
Vaccine indications. Cholera vaccine is indicated for travelers to countries requiring evidence of
cholera vaccination for entry. In addition, the complete primary series is suggested only for special
high-risk groups that live in areas in which cholera is highly endemic under insanitary conditions.
Boosters may be given every 6 months if required by a country.
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. Vaccination often results in 1-2 days of pain, erythema,
and induration at the site of injection. The local reaction may be accompanied by fever, malaise, and
headache. Serious reactions, including neurologic reactions, after cholera vaccination are extremely
rare.
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. No specific information is available on the safety of
cholera vaccine during pregnancy. Because cholera disease during pregnancy is a serious illness,
whether to use cholera vaccine should be determined in individual circumstances based on the actual
risk of disease and the probable benefits of the vaccine.
The only contraindication to cholera vaccine is a history of a severe reaction after a previous dose.
Most governments will permit unvaccinated travelers to enter the country if they carry a physician's
statement of medical contraindication. However, some countries may quarantine such unvaccinated
persons or place them under surveillance if they come from areas with cholera. Some data have
indicated that persons given yellow fever and cholera vaccines simultaneously or 1-3 weeks apart had
28


## p. 29 (#171) #############################################

lower than normal antibody responses to both vaccines. Unless there are time constraints, cholera and
yellow fever vaccines should be administered at a minimal interval of 3 weeks. If the vaccines cannot
be administered at least 3 weeks apart, they can be given simultaneously or anytime within the 3-week
interval.
Haemophilus influenzae type b
Healthy adults are not at increased risk of invasive Hib disease. Over 85% of invasive H. influenzae
cases occur among children <5 years of age (27). Among adults, invasive H. influenzae disease occurs
primarily among persons with chronic pulmonary disease and underlying conditions that predispose
to infections with encapsulated bacteria. Hib bacteria cause less than half the cases of invasive
H. influenzae disease among adults. Nontypeable H. influenzae bacteria are a more common cause of
invasive disease, such as pneumonia in adults, as well as of mucosal infections, such as otitis media
and bronchitis.
Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. The Hib vaccines available include three polysaccharide
protein conjugate vaccines licensed during the period 1987-1989. The conjugate vaccines are known to
be more immunogenic among children <2 years of age and among immunocompromised persons
than the polysaccharide polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate (PRP) vaccine, licensed in 1985. For this reason,
this PRP vaccine is no longer being produced in the United States.
Vaccine indications. No data documenting the efficacy of any Hib vaccine among children
>5 years of age or adults exist. This includes those persons with underlying conditions (e.g.,
splenectomy, sickle cell disease, Hodgkin disease and other hematologic neoplasms, and immuno-
suppression) that predispose to infections with encapsulated bacteria. Studies suggest, however, good
immunogenicity among patients with sickle cell disease (28) or leukemia (29) and among adults who
have had splenectomies (30) or HIV infection (31,32 ). Because of the theoretical risk to such patients,
physicians may wish to consider use of HbCV among individuals with functional or anatomic asplenia
or with HIV infection. Administering Hib vaccine to such patients is not contraindicated. One study
reported 12 (100%) of 12 healthy adults and 20 (87%) of 23 patients who had undergone splenectomies
responded with protective levels of antibody to conjugate vaccine, although the antibody levels were
significantly lower among the splenectomized patients (30). Because healthy adults are not at risk for
invasive Hib disease, routinely vaccinating health-care and day care workers who may come into close
contact with children with invasive Hib disease is unnecessary.
Rifampin prophylaxis is recommended for all household and day care contacts of cases of
invasive Hib disease, including children and adults, when there are any children <4 years of age
(households) or <2 years of age (day care classrooms) in the exposed group. Although not at risk
themselves, adults who have been exposed to a child with invasive Hib disease in a household or day
care setting may be asymptomatic carriers of the organism and can transmit it to other susceptible
children. Pregnant women should not receive rifampin, because its effect on the fetus has not been
established and it is teratogenic among laboratory animals.
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. In one study of children 15-24 months of age, local
reactions were noted for 12.5% of children receiving conjugate vaccine; moderate fever (temperature
>39.0 C [>102.2 F]) occurred among 0.7% of children (33). In a study of 35 children >9 years of age
and of adults who received conjugate vaccine (30) (23 of whom had had Hodgkin disease and had had
surgical splenectomy), 3 (8.5%) of the 35 complained of systemic side effects: weakness, nausea and
vertigo (1), myalgias (2), and fever (1).
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. The safety of HbCV for pregnant women has not been
established. On theoretical grounds, avoiding vaccination of pregnant women unless there is a
substantial risk of infection (e.g., anatomic or functional asplenia or HIV infection) is prudent.
Meningococcal Disease
Meningococcal disease is endemic throughout the world but may also occur in epidemics. Among
U.S. civilians, meningococcal disease occurs primarily as single, isolated cases, or, infrequently, in
small, localized clusters. One-third of all cases of meningococcal disease occur among patients >20
years old. Serogroup B and C strains cause the majority of U.S. cases, with serogroups Y and W135
accounting for most of the rest.
Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. One meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine, a quadriva-
lent A, C, Y, and W135 vaccine, is available for use in the United States. The vaccine is given as a single
dose and induces serogroup-specific immunity of unknown duration.
29


## p. 30 (#172) #############################################

Vaccine indications. Vaccine may be of benefit for travelers to areas with epidemic meningococcal
disease. Vaccine may also be used in aborting and controlling outbreaks caused by serogroups
represented in the vaccine. In addition, the ACIP recommends the vaccine for individuals with terminal
complement component deficiencies and those with anatomic or functional asplenia. The need for
booster doses has not been established.
Routine vaccination of U.S. civilians with meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is not recom-
mended because of the lack of availability of a group B vaccine and the low risk of infection in the
United States.
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. Adverse reactions to meningococcal polysaccharide
vaccine are infrequent and mild, consisting principally of localized erythema lasting 1-2 days.
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. The safety of meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine
for pregnant women has not been established. On theoretical grounds, avoiding it unless there is a
substantial risk of infection is prudent.
Plague
Plague is a natural infection of rodents and their fleas. In the United States, an average of 19 cases
has been reported yearly between 1979 and 1988 among humans exposed in the western United States
to infected animals (primarily rodents) and their fleas. Other countries currently reporting plague
infections are noted in the biweekly publication Summary of Health Information for International
Travel (see page 8). All state health departments and many county and city health departments receive
this publication. A number of countries in Africa, Asia, and South America continue to report sporadic,
epidemic, and epizootic infection. In most of these countries, the risk of exposure exists primarily in
rural or semirural areas.
Plague vaccine. A primary series of plague vaccine consists of three IM doses. The first dose, 1 mL,
is followed in 4 weeks by a second dose of 0.2 mL. The third dose, also 0.2 mL, is administered
5 months after the second. The effectiveness of a primary series of plague vaccine has never been
measured precisely. Field experience indicates that vaccination with plague vaccine reduces the
incidence and severity of disease resulting from the bite of infected fleas. The degree of protection
offered against primary pneumonic infection is unknown. Because plague vaccination may only
ameliorate illness, prophylactic antibiotics may be indicated whenever a person, vaccinated or not, has
a definite exposure.
Vaccine indications. Vaccination is indicated for certain vocational groups. These include all
laboratory and field personnel working with Y. pestis organisms that may be resistant to antimicro-
bials, persons engaged in aerosol experiments with Y. pestis, and field personnel engaged in
operations in areas with enzootic or epidemic plague in which preventing exposure to rodents and
fleas is impossible. Vaccine may also be considered for travelers to areas known to have endemic
plague, particularly if travel will not be limited to urban areas with tourist-hotel accommodations.
For persons with continuing exposure, two booster doses, each 0.1-0.2 mL, should be given
approximately 6 months apart. Thereafter, booster doses at 1- to 2-year intervals should provide good
protection.
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. For approximately 10% of recipients, primary vacci-
nation may result in general malaise, headache, fever, mild lymphadenopathy, and/or erythema and
induration at the injection site. These reactions occur more commonly with repeated injections. Sterile
abscesses occur rarely. Sensitivity reactions, manifested by urticarial and asthmatic phenomena, have
occasionally been reported.
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. Neither the safety nor the efficacy of vaccination with
plague vaccine during pregnancy has been determined; therefore, it should not be used unless there
is a substantial risk of infection.
Plague vaccine should not be administered to anyone with a known hypersensitivity to any of its
constituents (beef protein, soy, casein, and phenol). Patients who have had severe local or systemic
reactions to plague vaccine should not be revaccinated.
Pneumococcal Disease
Precise data on the occurrence of serious pneumococcal disease in the United States are not
available; however, the annual incidence rate of pneumococcal bacteremia is estimated to be 15-19
cases/100,000 population for all persons, and 50 cases/100,000 for persons >65 years old. The
incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia, which causes a substantial number of deaths annually, can be
30


## p. 31 (#173) #############################################

three to five times that of the detected rates of bacteremia. Mortality from all pneumococcal disease,
estimated at 40,000 deaths annually in the United States, is highest among patients who have
bacteremia or meningitis, patients with underlying medical conditions, and older persons.
Patients with certain chronic conditions are at increased risk of pneumococcal infection and severe
pneumococcal illness. Patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases, chronic pulmonary disease,
diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and cirrhosis have increased risk. Other patients at elevated risk include
those with functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease or splenectomy), Hodgkin disease,
lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, and organ transplantation.
Patients with AIDS are also at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, with an annual attack rate of
pneumococcal bacteremia as high as 9.4/1,000/year (34). Recurrent pneumococcal meningitis may
occur among patients with cerebrospinal fluid leakage that is complicating skull fractures or neurologic
procedures.
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine currently avail-
able contains purified capsular materials of the 23 types of S. pneumoniae responsible for 88% of
recent bacteremic pneumococcal disease in the United States. Most healthy adults show a two-fold
rise in type-specific antibody 2-3 weeks after administration of a single dose of vaccine. The titer of
antibody that is protective against each serotype has not been determined.
The duration of vaccine-induced immunity is unknown. Studies of persistence of vaccine-induced
antibody show elevated titers 5 years after vaccination among healthy adults.
Estimates of pneumococcal vaccine efficacy have varied widely in several studies. Studies based
on CDC's pneumococcal surveillance system suggest an efficacy of 60%-64% for vaccine-type strains
among patients with bacteremic disease. For all persons >65 years of age, vaccine efficacy was
44%-61%. Three case-control studies that have emphasized complete assessment of vaccination status
suggest a range of efficacy against pneumococcal bacteremia from 61% to 81%. Despite findings of
varying efficacy, the data continue to support the use of the pneumococcal vaccine for certain
well-defined groups at risk.
Patients who have received the earlier pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine containing capsular
material from only 14 types of Streptococcus pneumoniae should not be routinely revaccinated with
the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, as the increased coverage is modest. However,
revaccination should be strongly considered 6 years after the first dose for those at highest risk of
rapid decline in antibody levels (i.e., those with chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, or
transplanted organs) or of fatal pneumococcal infection (i.e., asplenic patients).
Vaccine indications. Available data regarding vaccine efficacy support the broader use of pneu-
mococcal polysaccharide vaccine in the United States. Vaccination is particularly recommended for the
following groups:
1. Immunocompetent adults who are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease or its complica-
tions because of chronic illnesses (e.g., cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes
mellitus, alcoholism, cirrhosis, or cerebrospinal fluid leaks) or who are >65 years old.
2. Immunocompromised adults at increased risk of pneumococcal disease or its complications
(e.g., persons with splenic dysfunction or anatomic asplenia, Hodgkin disease, lymphoma,
multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, or conditions such as organ
transplantation associated with immunosuppression).
3. Adults with asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV infection.
4. Persons living in special environments or social settings with an identified increased risk of
pneumococcal disease or its complications (e.g., certain Native American populations).
Programs for vaccine delivery in the recommended high-risk groups need to be developed further.
Specifically, more effective programs are needed for giving vaccine in physicians' offices, hospitals,
nursing homes, and other chronic-care facilities.
Two-thirds of persons with serious pneumococcal disease have been hospitalized within a 5-year
period before the pneumococcal illness (35). Therefore, vaccine should be given to hospitalized
patients in the high-risk groups before discharge in order to prevent future admissions for pneumo-
coccal disease. Also, persons with chronic conditions who visit physicians frequently are probably at
higher risk of pneumococcal infection than those who require infrequent visits. Office-based programs
to identify and vaccinate patients requiring frequent medical care should help prevent pneumococcal
illness. Furthermore, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza vaccine can be given at
different sites at the same time without an increase in side effects (36 ).
31


## p. 32 (#174) #############################################

Medicare has partially reimbursed the cost of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination since
1981. Hospitals may be reimbursed for pneumococcal vaccination of Medicare recipients independent
of reimbursement based on systems of prospective payments.
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. About half the persons given pneumococcal polysac-
charide vaccine experience mild side effects such as erythema and pain at the site of injection. Fever,
myalgias, and severe local reactions have been reported by <1% of those given pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine (37). Severe adverse effects such as anaphylactic reactions have rarely been
reported-approximately five cases per million doses administered. A similar incidence of adverse
events after primary vaccination and revaccination has been noted among adults when revaccination
occurs >4 years after primary vaccination (Merck Sharp & Dohme, unpublished data).
When the interval between first and second doses was <13 months, local reactions were more
severe (38); these reactions are thought to result from localized antigen-antibody reactions involving
antibody induced by a previous vaccination. Until more information is available, revaccination should
be given only to adults at highest risk of pneumococcal illness, as noted above in the "Vaccine
Indications' section.
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. The safety of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine
among pregnant women has not been evaluated. Women at high risk of pneumococcal disease ideally
should be vaccinated before pregnancy.
Both Inactivated-Bacteria and Live-Bacteria Vaccines
Typhoid
The occurrence of typhoid fever remained constant in the period 1975-1989, with an average of 447
cases reported annually. During the period 1975-1989, 59% of cases for which the patient's age was
known occurred among patients >20 years of age. Approximately 69% of typhoid cases reported in the
United States in 1984 were acquired by travelers to other countries.
Typhoid vaccine. A primary series of two 0.5-ml doses of phenol-inactivated typhoid vaccine
(given SC) 4 weeks apart has been shown to protect 51%-76% of recipients.
A live, attenuated oral typhoid vaccine was licensed in 1989. Its efficacy is approximately 67%,
when taken as recommended (four doses on alternate days).
An acetone-killed and -dried typhoid vaccine is available only to the U.S. Armed Forces.
Vaccine indications. Vaccination is indicated for travelers to areas where a recognized risk of
exposure to typhoid exists, although no country requires typhoid immunization for entry. Vaccination
is particularly recommended for travelers who will have prolonged exposure to potentially contami-
nated food and water in smaller villages or rural areas off the usual tourist routes. Further information
to guide travelers about typhoid immunization is contained in the publication Health Information for
International Travel (see page 8). Even after typhoid vaccination, food and water should be selected
carefully in these areas. Two other groups for whom selective vaccination is indicated are persons with
intimate exposure (i.e., continued household contact) to a documented typhoid carrier and workers in
microbiology laboratories who frequently work with Salmonella typhi. Typhoid vaccination is not
recommended in the United States for use in areas of natural disaster. Booster doses of the inactivated
vaccine should be given at least every 3 years to persons with continued or repeated exposure; these
may be administered SC (0.5 mL) or ID (0.1 mL). The optimal booster schedule for live, attenuated
Ty21a oral vaccine has not been determined, although efficacy has been shown to persist for 5 years
with a four-dose regimen. The manufacturer of Ty21a recommends revaccination with the entire
four-dose series every 5 years. No experience with using live, attenuated oral vaccine as a booster
among persons who were previously vaccinated with parenteral vaccine exists. The acetone-killed and
-dried vaccine, available only to the U.S. Armed Forces, should not be given ID.
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. Inactivated typhoid vaccine given SC often results in
1-2 days of discomfort at the site of injection. The local reaction may be accompanied by fever, malaise,
and headache.
Adverse reactions from the oral typhoid vaccine reported to the manufacturer occurred at a rate
of <1/100,000 doses administered. Reactions reported consisted of nausea, abdominal cramps,
vomiting, and skin rash or urticaria.
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. The only contraindication to inactivated typhoid
vaccine is a history of a severe local or systemic reaction after a previous dose.

Oral typhoid vaccine is not recommended for children <6 years of age or immunocompromised
persons, including those with asymptomatic HIV infection.
Live-Bacteria Vaccines
Tuberculosis
The number of tuberculosis cases in the United States has markedly declined since nationwide
reporting began in 1953. Between 1972 and 1984, the annual incidence of tuberculosis declined from
15.8 cases/100,000 population to 9.4/100,000, a decrease of 41%. Since 1984, however, the number of
cases reported and the case rate have increased. This increase is probably attributable to the
occurrence of tuberculosis among persons with HIV infection. In 1989, approximately 92.2% of 23,485
reported cases with patient ages known occurred among persons >20 years of age. The risk of
infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is greatest for those who have repeated exposure to
persons with unrecognized or untreated sputum-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. In the United States,
efforts to control tuberculosis are directed toward early identification and treatment of cases,
preventive therapy with isoniazid for infected persons at high risk of disease, and prevention of
transmission to others.
Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine. Although BCG is widely used in many areas of the world, results
of a recent large-scale field trial in India have raised questions about its efficacy (39). BCG vaccines
currently available in the United States differ from the products used in the published field trials, and
their efficacy has not been demonstrated directly. In the United States, vaccines for ID and for
percutaneous administration are licensed. (For percutaneous administration, one drop of vaccine is
placed on the skin and introduced through the skin by multiple punctures with a bifurcated or other
type of needle.) Vaccination should be only by the route indicated on the package labeling.
Vaccine indications. In the United States, BCG vaccination is no longer recommended for
health-care workers or other adults at high risk for acquiring TB infection. The only situations in which
BCG might be considered are for children with negative tuberculin skin tests who fall into the following
categories: a) those who cannot be placed on isoniazid preventive therapy but who have continuous
exposure to persons with active disease, b) those with continuous exposure to patients with organisms
resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, or c) those belonging to groups with exceptionally high annual
rates of new infection (i.e., >1% per year).
Vaccine side effects and adverse reactions. BCG has been associated with severe or prolonged
ulceration at the vaccination site, regional adenitis, disseminated BCG infection, and osteitis. Severe
ulceration and adenitis occur among approximately 1%-10% of vaccinees, although disseminated
infections and osteitis are quite rare (1-10 per million doses).
Vaccine precautions and contraindications. Although no harmful effects of BCG on the fetus have
been observed, avoiding vaccination during pregnancy unless there is immediate excessive risk of
exposure to infective tuberculosis is prudent.
Because BCG is a live-bacteria vaccine, it should not be given to persons immunocompromised as
a result of immune deficiency diseases (including HIV infection), leukemia, lymphoma, and generalized
malignancy, or to persons immunosuppressed as a result of therapy with corticosteroids, alkylating
drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation. (See "Conditions that compromise the Immune System.")
Other Licensed Vaccines
Adenovirus and Adenovirus Vaccine
Adenovirus types 4 and 7 have frequently been the cause of outbreaks of acute, febrile respiratory
tract disease among young adults during military training. Live, oral adenovirus vaccines for types 4
and 7 are available for vaccination of military populations. Use of the vaccines in other populations is
not recommended.
Anthrax and Anthrax Vaccine
Anthrax is infrequently encountered. Anthrax vaccine is recommended only for individuals who
come in contact in the workplace with imported animal hides, furs, bonemeal, wool, animal hair
(especially goat hair), and bristles and for persons undertaking investigations involving Bacillus
anthracis.
Primary vaccination consists of six SC 0.5-mL injections, the first three at 2-week intervals and the
other three at 6-month intervals. Booster doses of 0.5-mL SC are recommended at 1-year intervals. The
33


## p. 34 (#176) #############################################

vaccine is only available from the Biologic Products Program, Michigan Department of Public Health.
Details on reactions and vaccine contraindications are found in the package insert.
Immune Globulins
IG and specific immune globulins (i.e., HBIG, TIG, HRIG, and varicella-zoster immune globulin
[VZIG]) are indicated to prevent or modify certain diseases in specific circumstances.
Cytomegalovirus Immune Globulin
This is a hyperimmune intravenous preparation that is effective in both prophylaxis (alone) and
treatment (with ganciclovir) of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in bone marrow and kidney
transplant recipients. When used as a prophylactic agent, CMV immune globulin has been used over
a period of several months and does not diminish the frequency of CMV infections, but it does limit
disease and reduce death rates.
Hepatitis B Immune Globulin
HBIG, alone or in combination with HB vaccine, is used for postexposure prophylaxis of HBV
infection among persons who have not previously received HB vaccine or who are known not to have
responded to the vaccine series. For percutaneous or mucous-membrane exposure to blood known to
be HBsAg positive or from a bite by an HBV carrier, a single dose of HBIG (0.06 mL/kg or 5 mL for
adults) should be administered as soon as possible and a series of three doses of HB vaccine begun
within 1 week after exposure. Vaccine and HBIG may be administered simultaneously, but at different
sites. For those who choose not to take HB vaccine, a second, identical dose of HBIG should be
administered 1 month later.
After any percutaneous exposure to blood, serologic confirmation of the HBsAg status of the source
patient should be obtained as soon as possible. If the source patient is HBsAg positive, the exposed
person should immediately receive HBIG and HB vaccine according to the schedule above. The value
of HBIG given beyond 7 days after exposure is unclear. For management of HBsAg-positive
percutaneous exposure among persons who have previously received HB vaccine, the ACIP's
Recommendations for "Protection of Viral Hepatitis” should be consulted (21) (Table 9).
All susceptible persons whose sex partners have acute HBV infection or whose sex partners are
discovered to be HBsAg carriers should receive a single dose of HBIG (0.06 mL/kg) and should begin
the HB vaccine series if prophylaxis can be started within 14 days of the last sexual contact or if
ongoing sexual contact will occur. Administering the vaccine with HBIG may improve the efficacy of
postexposure treatment; in addition, the vaccine has the advantage of conferring long-lasting
protection. These recommendations, along with those for newborn infants exposed to HBsAg-carrier
mothers, are listed in Table 10. An alternative treatment for persons who are not from a high-risk group
for whom vaccine is routinely recommended and whose regular sex partners have acute HBV infection
is to give one dose of HBIG within 14 days of exposure (without vaccine) and retest the sex partner for
HBsAg 3 months later. No further treatment is necessary if the sex partner becomes HBsAg negative.
If the sex partner remains HBsAg positive, a second dose of HBIG should be administered and the HBV
vaccine series started.
Human Rabies Immune Globulin
Postexposure prophylaxis for rabies should always include HRIG with one exception: persons who
have been previously vaccinated with the recommended preexposure or postexposure regimens of
HDCV or have been vaccinated with other types of rabies vaccines and have a history of documented
adequate rabies antibody titer should not receive HRIG (Table 7). The recommended dose of HRIG is
20 IU/kg body weight. If anatomically feasible, thoroughly infiltrate the area around the wound with up
to half the dose of HRIG; the rest of the HRIG should be administered IM.
Immune Globulin for Intramuscular Use
IG is given IM for preexposure prophylaxis against hepatitis A to travelers in areas where contact
with potentially contaminated food and water is anticipated. For travelers at risk for 2-3 months, a
single IM dose of 0.02 ml/kg is recommended. For more prolonged travel, 0.06 mL/kg should be
administered every 5 months. For persons whose travel repeatedly places them at risk for hepatitis A,
testing for antibodies to hepatitis A is useful to identify those who are immune and to eliminate
unnecessary doses of IG. IG is also indicated for postexposure prophylaxis for close household and
sexual contacts of persons with hepatitis A, staff and attendees of day care centers, household contacts
34


## p. 35 (#177) #############################################

of diapered children in day care centers in which hepatitis A transmission is occurring, selected staff
and clients of custodial institutions in which an outbreak is occurring, and co-workers of food handlers
with hepatitis A. For such contacts, a single dose of 0.02 ml/kg of IG is recommended as soon as
possible after exposure. IG is not effective unless given within 2 weeks after exposure.
IG can be used to prevent or modify measles disease in susceptible contacts of persons with
measles, especially those for whom measles vaccine is contraindicated, if given within 6 days after
exposure. The recommended dose is 0.25 ml/kg, or 0.5 mL/kg for immunocompromised persons
(maximum dose = 15 mL in both situations). IG should not be used to control measles outbreaks.
Immune Globulin for Intravenous Use
IG modified for intravenous (IV) use may be administered to prevent acute infections among
patients with defective antibody synthesis or, in unusual situations, as prophylaxis against hepatitis A
or measles for patients for whom the IM preparation is contraindicated because of thrombocytopenia
or disorders that can cause IM hemorrhage. However, no data are available about the efficacy of IG
when administered IV in preventing either hepatitis A or measles. Because IG modified for IV use is
made from a relatively small pool of donors, it may not contain antibodies to hepatitis A. ONLY IG
MODIFIED FOR IV USE CAN BE GIVEN INTRAVENOUSLY. The IV dose is 100 mg/kg, administered
slowly. The IV preparation is supplied in 50-ml vials containing 2.5 g of IG.
Tetanus Immune Globulin
TIG is indicated in tetanus prophylaxis as part of the management of wounds other than clean,
minor wounds in persons a) whose previous T toxoid vaccination status is unknown or uncertain or
b) who have received fewer than three previous T toxoid doses. The currently recommended
prophylactic dose for wounds of average severity is 250 units (U) IM. Td should be administered at the
same time but at a separate site.
A summary of the indications for active and passive immunization in the management of wounds
is provided in Table 8.
Vaccinia Immune Globulin
Vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) is available only from CDC's Drug Service (404-639-3670) for the
treatment of eczema vaccinatum, vaccinia necrosum, and ocular vaccinia developed as a result of
smallpox vaccination. VIG is of no benefit in the treatment of postvaccination encephalitis. The
recommended dose is 0.6 ml/kg IM to be administered as soon as possible after onset of symptoms.
Because therapeutic doses of VIG can be quite large (e.g., 42 mL for a 70-kg person), the doses should
be divided over a 24- to 36-hour period. Doses may be repeated at the discretion of the attending
physician, usually every 2-3 days, until no new lesions appear.
Varicella-Zoster Immune Globulin
Most persons with a clearly positive history of previous varicella are probably immune. Most adults
(85%-95%) with negative or unknown histories of varicella disease (chickenpox) are likely to be
immune. (Susceptibility rates for adults raised in some tropical areas, particularly remote areas, may
be somewhat higher.) When available, serologic screening may be used to define susceptibility more
precisely. Rates of complications and death for immunocompromised adults who contract varicella are
likely to be substantially greater than for normal adults. After being carefully and individually
evaluated, an immunocompromised patient who is believed to be susceptible and who has had
significant exposure to varicella should receive VZIG to prevent complications.
Significant exposure to a person with varicella includes household contact, close contact indoors of
>1 hour, sharing the same two- to four-bed hospital room, or prolonged, direct, face-to-face contact
such as occurs with nurses or doctors who care for the patient.
Chickenpox can be more severe among adults than among normal children. The decision to
administer VZIG to a normal adult should be made on an individual basis. The objective of VZIG use
for normal adults is to modify rather than prevent illness in the hope of inducing lifelong immunity.
When deciding whether to administer VZIG, the clinician should consider the patient's health status,
the type of exposure, and the likelihood of previous infection. Adults who were older siblings in large
families or whose children have had varicella are probably immune. If, after being carefully evaluated,
a normal adult with substantial exposure to varicella is believed to be susceptible, VZIG may be
administered. Pregnant women and potentially susceptible hospital personnel should be evaluated in
the same way as other adults. Supplies of VZIG are limited, and indiscriminate administration of VZIG
35


## p. 36 (#178) #############################################

to normal adults would quickly exhaust supplies and prevent prophylaxis for known high-risk
individuals. The cost of a five-vial adult dose is approximately $400.
VZIG, available through some American Red Cross distribution centers (Appendix 6), is supplied in
vials containing 125 U. Although 125 U/10 kg of body weight up to a maximum of 625 U is considered
likely to prevent or modify varicella among normal adults, higher doses may be necessary for the
immunocompromised adult. However, the appropriate dose for immunocompromised adults has not
been determined. VZIG should be administered IM as directed by the manufacturer. Although the
duration of protection is unknown, the protection should probably last for at least one half-life of the
IG, that is, approximately 3 weeks.
Immune Globulin Side Effects and Adverse Reactions
Serious adverse effects from immune globulins administered as recommended have been rare.
Immune Globulin Precautions and Contraindications
IG, if needed, is not contraindicated for pregnant women. Except for its IV preparation, IG is prepared
for IM use and should not be given IV. The various preparations intended for IM use should not be
given to patients with severe thrombocytopenia or other coagulation disorders that would ordinarily
contraindicate IM injections, unless the expected benefits outweigh the risks.
Parenterally administered live-virus vaccines (e.g., MMR or other combinations) should be given at
least 14 days before, or at least 6 weeks and preferably 3 months after, the administration of IG
preparations. If an IG must be administered within 14 days after the administration of most live-virus
vaccines, the vaccine should be administered again 3 months after the IG. If the interval between
receipt of the vaccine and receipt of the IG is longer, the vaccine need not be readministered.
Preliminary data indicate that IG preparations do not interfere with the immune response to either
OPV or yellow fever vaccine.
No evidence suggests that HBV, HIV, or other viruses have ever been transmitted by the IG or HBIG
that is commercially available in the United States (40). Since April 1985, all plasma units for
preparation of all IG have been screened for antibody to HIV, and reactive units are discarded. No
instance of HIV transmission or clinical illness consistent with HIV infection attributable to receiving IG
or HBIG, including lots prepared before April 1985, has been observed. Laboratory studies have shown
that the margin of safety based on the removal of HIV infectivity by the fractionation process is
extremely high (41 ). Some HBIG lots prepared before April 1985 have detectable HIV antibody; low
levels of passively acquired HIV antibody can occasionally be detected among recipients shortly after
administration, but this reactivity does not persist (42).

'Encephalopathy means any significant acquired abnormality of, injury to, or impairment of function of the brain. Among the frequent
manifestations of encephalopathy are focal and diffuse neurologic signs, increased intracaranial pressure, or changes lasting at least 6 hours in level
of consciousness, with or without convulsions. The neurologic signs and symptoms of encephalopathy may be temporary with complete recovery
or may result in various degrees of permanent impairment. Signs and symptoms such as high-pitched and unusual screaming, persistent
inconsolable crying, and bulging fontanel are compatible with an encephalopathy, but in and of themselves are not conclusive evidence of
encephalopathy. Encephalopathy usually can be documented by slow wave activity on an electroencephalogram.
** Shock-collapse or hypotonic-hyporesponsive collapse may include signs or symptoms such as decrease or loss of muscle tone, paralysis (partial
or complete), hemiplegia, hemiparesis, loss of color or turning pale white or blue, unresponsiveness to environmental stimuli, depression of or loss
of consciousness, prolonged sleeping with difficulty being aroused, or cardiovascular or respiratory arrest.
**Residual seizure disorder may have occurred if no other seizure or convulsion unaccompanied by fever or accompanied by a fever of <102 F
occurred before the first seizure or convulsion after the administration of the vaccine involved, and if, in the case of measles-, mumps-, or

immunized.)
Although a protective immune
response to elPV in the
immunocompromised person
cannot be assured, the
vaccine is safe, and some
protection may result from
its administration.
Although there is no con-
vincing evidence docu-
menting adverse effects
of either OPV or elPV
on the pregnant woman
or developing fetus, it
is prudent on theoretical
grounds to avoid vacci-
nating pregnant women.
However, if immediate
protection against polio-
myelitis is needed, OPV
is recommended. OPV
should not be given to
immunocompromised indi-
viduals or to persons
with known or possibly
immunocompromised

inactivated-virus apart; third dose 5
vaccine
months after second;
booster doses not
necessary within 7
years of primary series.
Alternate schedule
for one vaccine: three
doses IM 4 weeks apart;
fourth dose 10 months
after the third.
Data are not available on
the safety of the vaccine
for the developing fetus.
Because the vaccine
contains only noninfectious
HBsAg particles, the risk
should be negligible.
Pregnancy should not
be considered a vaccine
contraindication if the

eligible.
The vaccine produces neither
therapeutic nor adverse effects
on HBV-infected persons.

If there is substantial
risk of exposure to rabies,
preexposure vaccination

(See text.)
Postexposure prophylaxis:
All postexposure treat-
ment should begin
with soap and water.
The decision for postexposure
use of HDCV depends on the
species of biting animal, the
circumstances of biting
incident, and the type of expo-
sure (e.g., bite, saliva contami-
nation of wound). The type of
and schedule for postexposure
prophylaxis depends upon
the person's previous rabies
vaccination status, or the
result of a previous or
current serologic test for
rabies antibody. For
postexposure prophylaxis,
HDCV should always be
administered IM, not ID.

(WEE), c) Venezuelan equine encephalitis vaccine (VEE), and d) tularemia vaccine. Pentavalent (ABCDE) botulinum toxoid is available only through
CDC's Drug Service.
When any vaccine or toxoid is indicated during pregnancy, waiting until the second or the third trimester, when possible, is a reasonable
precaution that minimizes concern about teratogenicity.
Persons immunocompromised because of immune deficiency diseases, HIV infection (who should primarily not receive OPV and yellow fever
vaccines) (see text), leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy or immunosuppressed as a result of therapy with corticosteroids, alkylating
drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation.
**Some persons have recommended 125 U/10 kg regardless of total body weight.

*The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) periodically reviews recommendations
on vaccination and prophylaxis. When recommendations are revised, they are published
individually in the MMWR.
*Each year influenza vaccine recommendations are reviewed and amended to reflect updated
information on influenza activity in the United States for the preceding influenza season and to
provide information on the vaccine available for the upcoming influenza season. These
recommendations are published in the MMWR annually, usually in May or June.

Protection Against Viral Hepatitis
Recommendations of the
Immunization Practices
Advisory Committee (ACIP)
The following statement updates all previous recommendations on protection against viral hepatitis,
including use of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin for prophylaxis of hepatitis B
(MMWR 1985;34:313-24,329-35 and MMWR 1987,36:353-66), universal screening of pregnant women
to prevent perinatal hepatitis B transmission (MMWR 1988;37:341-46,51), and use of immune globulin
to prevent other types of viral hepatitis (MMWR 1985;34:313-24,329-35).
INTRODUCTION
The term "viral hepatitis" is commonly used for several clinically similar diseases that are
etiologically and epidemiologically distinct (1). Two of these, hepatitis A (formerly called infectious
hepatitis) and hepatitis B (formerly called serum hepatitis), have been recognized as separate entities
since the early 1940s and can be diagnosed with specific serologic tests. A third category, currently
known as non-A, non-B hepatitis, includes two epidemiologically distinct types of hepatitis: parenter-
ally transmitted and enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis. Parenterally transmitted non-A,
non-B hepatitis is associated with both posttransfusion and sporadic cases of acute hepatitis and may
be caused by at least two different agents. Part of the genome for one of these agents has recently been
cloned, and a candidate serologic assay for antibody to this virus (proposed as hepatitis C virus) has
been developed (2,3). Enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis, which is spread by the fecal-oral
route and is different from the types seen in the United States, has been reported in parts of Asia,
Africa, and Mexico (4). Another distinct type of hepatitis, delta hepatitis, is an infection dependent on
the hepatitis B virus. It may occur as a coinfection with acute hepatitis B infection or as superinfection
of a hepatitis B carrier (5).
HEPATITIS SURVEILLANCE
Approximately 28,500 cases of hepatitis A, 23,200 cases of hepatitis B, 2,620 cases of non-A, non-B
hepatitis, and 2,470 cases of hepatitis type unspecified were reported in 1988 in the United States. Most
cases of each type occur among young adults. Since reporting from many localities is incomplete, the
actual number of hepatitis cases occurring annually is thought to be several times the reported
number.
IMMUNE GLOBULINS
Immune globulins are important tools for preventing infection and disease before or after exposure
to hepatitis viruses. Immune globulins used in medical practice are sterile solutions of antibodies
(immunoglobulins) from human plasma. They are prepared by cold ethanol fractionation of large
plasma pools and contain 10%-18% protein. In the United States, plasma is primarily obtained from
paid donors. Only plasma shown to be free of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is used to prepare immune globulins.
Immune globulin (IG) (formerly called immune serum globulin, ISG, or gamma globulin) produced
in the United States contains antibodies against the hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and the HBsAg
(anti-HBs). Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is an IG prepared from plasma containing high titers of
anti-HBs.
3


## p. 4 (#226) ##############################################

There is no evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV (the causative agent of acquired immunode-
ficiency syndrome (AIDS)), or other viruses have ever been transmitted by IG or HBIG commercially
available in the United States (6). Since late April 1985, all plasma units for preparation of IGs have
been screened for antibody to HIV, and reactive units are discarded. No instances of HIV infection or
clinical illness have occurred that can be attributed to receiving IG or HBIG, including lots prepared
before April 1985. Laboratory studies have shown that the margin of safety based on the removal of
HIV infectivity by the fractionation process is extremely high (7). Some HBIG lots prepared before April
1985 have detectable HIV antibody. Shortly after being given HBIG, recipients have occasionally been
noted to have low levels of passively acquired HIV antibody, but this reactivity does not persist (8).
Serious adverse effects from IGs administered as recommended have been rare. IGs prepared for
intramuscular administration should be used for hepatitis prophylaxis. IGs prepared for intravenous
administration to immunodeficient and other selected patients are not intended for hepatitis prophy-
laxis. IG and HBIG are not contraindicated for pregnant or lactating women.
HEPATITIS A
Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV), a 27-nm ribonucleic acid (RNA) agent that is
classified as a picornavirus. Patients with illness caused by HAV characteristically have abrupt onsets
of symptoms including fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark urine, and
jaundice. Severity is related to age. Among children, most infections are asymptomatic, and illness is
usually not accompanied by jaundice. Most infected adults become symptomatically ill with jaundice.
The case-fatality rate among reported cases is about 0.6%.
Hepatitis A is primarily transmitted by person-to-person contact, generally through fecal contami-
nation and oral ingestion. Transmission is facilitated by poor personal hygiene, poor sanitation, and
intimate (intrahousehold or sexual) contact. In recent years, cases of hepatitis A among intravenous
drug users, most likely due to person-to-person contact, have been reported with increasing frequency
(9). Common-source epidemics from contaminated food and water also occur. Sharing utensils or
cigarettes or kissing is not believed to transmit the hepatitis A virus.
The incubation period of hepatitis A is 15-50 days (average 28). High concentrations of HAV (108
particles/g) are found in stool specimens from infected persons. Virus in the feces reaches its highest
concentration late in the incubation period and early in the prodromal phase of illness, and it
diminishes rapidly once jaundice appears. Greatest infectivity is during the 2-week period immediately
before the onset of jaundice. Viremia probably occurs during the period that the virus is shed in feces.
Virus has not been found in urine. A chronic carrier state with HAV in blood or feces has not been
demonstrated. Transmission of HAV by blood transfusion has been reported but is uncommon (10).
The diagnosis of acute hepatitis A is confirmed by finding IgM anti-HAV in serum collected during
the acute or early convalescent phase of the disease. IgG anti-HAV, which appears in the convalescent
phase of the disease and remains detectable in serum thereafter, confers enduring protection against
the disease. Commercial tests are available to detect IgM anti-HAV and total anti-HAV in serum.
Although the incidence of hepatitis A in the United States in the 1980s was lower than that in the
1970s, a 26% increase in incidence was observed between 1983 and 1988. It is still a common infection
among older children and young adults. In 1988, 50% of reported cases of hepatitis in this country were
attributable to hepatitis A.
--
Recommendations for IG Prophylaxis for Hepatitis A
Numerous field studies conducted in the past 4 decades confirm that IG given before exposure or
during the incubation period of hepatitis A is protective against clinical illness (11-13). Its prophylactic
value is greatest (80%-90%) when given early in the incubation period and declines thereafter (13).
Recent tests have shown slightly decreased titers of anti-HAV in current IG lots compared with lots
tested 8 years previously; however, no differences in IG efficacy have been noted.
Preexposure Prophylaxis
The major group for whom preexposure prophylaxis is recommended is international travelers. The
risk of hepatitis A for U.S. citizens traveling abroad varies with living conditions, length of stay, and the
incidence of hepatitis A infection in areas visited (14-16). In general, travelers to developed areas of
4


## p. 5 (#227) ##############################################

North America, western Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand are at no greater risk of infection
than they would be in the United States. For travelers to developing countries, risk of infection
increases with duration of travel and is highest for those who live in or visit rural areas, trek in back
country, or frequently eat or drink in settings of poor sanitation. Nevertheless, recent studies have
shown that many cases of travel-related hepatitis A occur in travelers with "standard" tourist
itineraries, accommodations, and food and beverage consumption behaviors (16 and CDC unpub-
lished data). In developing countries, travelers should minimize their exposure to hepatitis A and other
enteric diseases by avoiding potentially contaminated water or food. Travelers should avoid drinking
water (or beverages with ice) of unknown purity and eating uncooked shellfish or uncooked fruits or
vegetables that they did not prepare.
IG is recommended for all susceptible travelers to developing countries (17). IG is especially
important for persons who will be living in or visiting rural areas, eating or drinking in settings of poor
or uncertain sanitation, or who will have close contact with local persons (especially young children)
in settings with poor sanitary conditions. Persons who plan to reside in developing areas for long
periods should receive IG regularly.
For travelers, a single dose of IG of 0.02 ml/kg of body weight is recommended if travel is for <3
months. For prolonged travel or residence in developing countries, 0.06 ml/kg should be given every
5 months. For persons who require repeated IG prophylaxis, screening for total anti-HAV before travel
is useful to define susceptibility and eliminate unnecessary doses of IG for those who are immune. IG
produced in developing countries may not meet the standards for purity required in most developed
countries. Persons needing repeat doses overseas should use products that meet U.S. license
requirements.
Postexposure Prophylaxis
Hepatitis A cannot be reliably diagnosed on clinical presentation alone, and serologic confirmation
of index patients is recommended before contacts are treated. Serologic screening of contacts for
anti-HAV before they are given IG is not recommended because screening is more costly than IG and
would delay its administration.
For postexposure IG prophylaxis, a single intramuscular dose of 0.02 ml/kg is recommended. IG
should be given as soon as possible after last exposure; giving IG more than 2 weeks after exposure
is not indicated.
Specific recommendations for IG prophylaxis for hepatitis A depend on the nature of the HAV
exposure.
1. Close personal contact. IG is recommended for all household and sexual contacts of persons with
hepatitis A.
2. Day-care centers. Day-care facilities attended by children in diapers can be important settings for
HAV transmission (18-20). IG should be administered to all staff and attendees of day-care
centers or homes if a) one or more children or employees are diagnosed as having hepatitis A,
or b) cases are recognized in two or more households of center attendees. When an outbreak
(hepatitis cases in three or more families) occurs, IG should also be considered for members of
households that have children (center attendees) in diapers. In centers not enrolling children in
diapers, IG need only be given to classroom contacts of an index patient.
3. Schools. Contact at elementary and secondary schools is usually not an important means of
transmitting hepatitis A. Routine administration of IG is not indicated for pupils and teachers in
contact with a patient. However, when an epidemiologic investigation clearly shows the existence
of a school- or classroom-centered outbreak, IG may be given to persons who have close contact
with patients.
4. Institutions for custodial care. Living conditions in some institutions, such as prisons and facilities
for the developmentally disabled, favor transmission of hepatitis A. When outbreaks occur, giving
IG to residents and staff who have close contact with patients with hepatitis A may reduce the
spread of disease. Depending on the epidemiologic circumstances, prophylaxis can be limited or
can involve the entire institution.
5. Hospitals. Routine IG prophylaxis for hospital personnel is not indicated. Rather, sound hygienic
practices should be emphasized. Staff education should point out the risk of exposure to hepatitis
A and should emphasize precautions regarding direct contact with potentially infective materials
(21).
5


## p. 6 (#228) ##############################################

Outbreaks of hepatitis A occur occasionally among hospital staff, usually in association with an
unsuspected index patient who is fecally incontinent. Large outbreaks have occurred from
contact with infected infants in neonatal intensive care units (10). In outbreaks, prophylaxis of
persons exposed to feces of infected patients may be indicated.
6. Offices and factories. Routine IG administration is not indicated under the usual office or factory
conditions for persons exposed to a fellow worker with hepatitis A. Experience shows that casual
contact in the work setting does not result in virus transmission.
7. Common-source exposure. IG use might be effective in preventing foodborne or waterborne
hepatitis A if exposure is recognized in time. However, IG is not recommended for persons
exposed to a common source of hepatitis infection after cases have begun to occur, since the
2-week period during which IG is effective will have been exceeded.
If a food handler is diagnosed as having hepatitis A, common-source transmission is possible
but uncommon. IG should be administered to other food handlers but is usually not recom-
mended for patrons (22). However, IG administration to patrons may be considered if all of the
following conditions exist: a) the infected person is directly involved in handling, without gloves,
foods that will not be cooked before they are eaten, and b) the hygienic practices of the food
handler are deficient or the food handler has had diarrhea, and c) patrons can be identified and
treated within 2 weeks of exposure. Situations in which repeated exposures may have occurred,
such as in institutional cafeterias, may warrant stronger consideration of IG use.

HEPATITIS B
Hepatitis B infection is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV), a 42-nm, double-shelled deoxyribo-
nucleic acid (DNA) virus of the class hepadnaviridae. Several well-defined antigen-antibody systems
are associated with HBV infection (Table 1). HBsAg is found on the surface of the virus and is also
produced in excess amounts, circulating in blood as 22-nm spherical and tubular particles. HBsAg can
be identified in serum 30-60 days after exposure to HBV and persists for variable periods. Anti-HBs
develops after a resolved infection and is responsible for long-term immunity. Antibody to the core
antigen (anti-HBc) develops in all HBV infections and persists indefinitely. IgM anti-HBc appears early
in infection and persists for >6 months. It is a reliable marker of acute or recent HBV infection. A third
antigen, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), may be detected in samples from persons with acute or chronic
HBV infection. The presence of HBeAg correlates with viral replication and high infectivity. Antibody to
HBeAg (anti-HBe) develops in most HBV infections and correlates with the loss of replicating virus and
with lower infectivity.
The incubation period of hepatitis B is long (45-160 days; average = 120), and the onset of acute
disease is generally insidious. Clinical symptoms and signs include anorexia, malaise, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Extrahepatic manifestations of disease, such as skin rashes,
arthralgias, and arthritis - can also occur. The case-fatality rate for reported cases is approximately
1.4%.
A variable proportion of individuals infected with HBV will become chronically infected with the
virus. The HBV carrier is central to the epidemiology of HBV transmission. A carrier is defined as a
person who is either HBsAg-positive on at least two occasions (at least 6 months apart) or who is
HBsAg-positive and IgM anti-HBc negative when a single serum specimen is tested. Although the
degree of infectivity is best correlated with HBeAg-positivity, any person positive for HBsAg is
potentially infectious. The likelihood of becoming chronically infected with HBV varies inversely with
the age at which infection occurs. HBV transmitted from HBsAg-positive mothers to their newborns
results in HBV carriage for up to 90% of infants. Between 25% and 50% of children infected before 5
years of age become carriers, whereas only 6%-10% of acutely infected adults become carriers.
Carriers and persons with acute infection have the highest concentrations of HBV in blood and
serous fluids. A lower concentration is present in other body fluids, such as saliva and semen.
Transmission occurs via percutaneous or permucosal routes, and infective blood or body fluids can be
introduced at birth, through sexual contact, or by contaminated needles. Infection can also occur in
settings of continuous close personal contact (such as in households or among children in institutions
for the developmentally disabled), presumably via inapparent or unnoticed contact of infective
secretions with skin lesions or mucosal surfaces. Transmission of infection by transfusion of blood or
blood products is rare because of routine screening of blood for HBsAg and because of current donor
selection procedures. Transmission of HBV from infected health-care workers to patients is uncommon
but has been documented during types of invasive procedures (e.g., oral and gynecologic surgery)
(23,24). HBsAg-positive health-care workers need not be restricted from patient contact unless they
have been epidemiologically associated with HBV transmission. Rather, they should be educated
about the potential mechanisms of HBV transmission. Adherence to aseptic techniques minimizes the
risk of transmission. HBV is not transmitted via the fecal-oral route.
Worldwide, HBV infection is a major cause of acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and primary
hepatocellular carcinoma. The frequency of HBV infection and patterns of transmission vary markedly
in different parts of the world. In the United States, Western Europe, and Australia, it is a disease of low
endemicity, with infection occurring primarily during adulthood and with only 0.2%-0.9% of the
population being chronically infected. In contrast, HBV infection is highly endemic in China and
Southeast Asia, most of Africa, most Pacific Islands, parts of the Middle East, and in the Amazon Basin.
In these areas, most persons acquire infection at birth or during childhood, and 8%-15% of the
population are chronically infected with HBV. In other parts of the world, HBV infection is moderately
endemic, with 2%-7% of the population being HBV carriers. Prevention strategies for populations in
which HBV infection is highly endemic are directed at vaccinating infants with hepatitis B vaccine,
usually beginning at birth, to prevent both perinatal and childhood transmission of infection (25).
Recommendations for hepatitis B prophylaxis in other areas should be designed to maximize the
interruption of HBV transmission in accordance with local patterns of transmission. The recommen-
dations that follow are intended for use in the United States.

Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States
Each year, an estimated 300,000 persons, primarily young adults, are infected with HBV. One-quarter
become ill with jaundice, more than 10,000 patients require hospitalization, and an average of 250 die
of fulminant disease. The United States currently contains an estimated pool of 750,000-1,000,000
infectious carriers. Approximately 25% of carriers develop chronic active hepatitis, which often
progresses to cirrhosis. Furthermore, HBV carriers have a risk of developing primary liver cancer that
is 12-300 times higher than that of other persons. An estimated 4,000 persons die each year from
hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, and more than 800 die from hepatitis B-related liver cancer.
Serologic surveys demonstrate that, although HBV infection is uncommon among adults in the
general population, it is highly prevalent in certain groups. Those at risk, based on the prevalence of
serologic markers of infection, are described in Table 2. Persons born in areas of high HBV endemicity
and their descendents remain at high risk of infection, as do certain populations in which HBV is highly
endemic (Alaskan Natives and Pacific Islanders). Certain lifestyles (e.g., homosexual activity, intrave-
nous drug abuse) result in early acquisition of HBV infection and high rates of infection. Persons who
have heterosexual activity with multiple partners are at significant risk of infection. Inmates of prisons
have a high prevalence of HBV markers, usually because of parenteral drug abuse before or during
imprisonment. Patients in custodial institutions for the developmentally disabled are also at increased
risk of having HBV infection. Household contacts and sexual partners of HBV carriers are at increased
risk, as are hemodialysis patients and recipients of certain plasma-derived products that have not been
inactivated (e.g., anti-hemophilic factor).
Those at occupational risk of HBV infection include medical and dental workers, related laboratory
and support personnel, and public service employees who have contact with blood, as well as staff in
institutions or classrooms for the mentally retarded.
Hepatitis B Prevention Strategies in the United States
The incidence of reported acute hepatitis B cases increased steadily over the past decade and
reached a peak in 1985 (11.50 cases/10/year), despite the introduction of hepatitis B vaccine 3 years
previously. Incidence decreased modestly (18%) by 1988, but still remains higher than a decade ago.
This minimal impact of hepatitis B vaccine on disease incidence is attributable to several factors. The
sources of infection for most cases include intravenous drug abuse (28%), heterosexual contact with

infected persons or multiple partners (22%), and homosexual activity (9%). In addition, 30% of patients
with Hepatitis B deny any of the recognized risk factors for infection.
The present strategy for hepatitis B prevention is to vaccinate those individuals at high risk of
infection. Most persons receiving vaccine as a result of this strategy have been persons at risk of
acquiring HBV infection through occupational exposure, a group that accounts for approximately 4%
of cases. The major deterrents to vaccinating the other high-risk groups include their lack of knowledge
about the risk of disease and its consequences, the lack of public-sector programs, the cost of vaccine,
and the inability to access most of the high-risk populations.
For vaccine to have an impact on the incidence of hepatitis B, a comprehensive strategy must be
developed that will provide hepatitis B vaccination to persons before they engage in behaviors or
occupations that place them at risk of infection. Universal HBsAg screening of pregnant women was
recently recommended to prevent perinatal HBV transmission. The previous recommendations for
selective screening failed to identify most HBsAg-positive pregnant women (27). As an alternative to
high-risk-group vaccination, universal vaccination of infants and adolescents needs to be examined as
a possible strategy to control the transmission of disease.
Hepatitis B Prophylaxis
Two types of products are available for prophylaxis against hepatitis B. Hepatitis B vaccines, first
licensed in 1981, provide active immunization against HBV infection, and their use is recommended for
both preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis. HBIG provides temporary, passive protection and is
indicated only in certain postexposure settings.
HBIG
HBIG is prepared from plasma preselected to contain a high titer of anti-HBs. In the United States,
HBIG has an anti-HBs titer of >100,000 by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Human plasma from which HBIG
is prepared is screened for antibodies to HIV; in addition, the Cohn fractionation process used to
prepare this product inactivates and eliminates HIV from the final product. There is no evidence that the
causative agent of AIDS (HIV) has been transmitted by HBIG (6).
Hepatitis B Vaccine
Two types of hepatitis B vaccines are currently licensed in the United States. Plasma-derived vaccine
consists of a suspension of inactivated, alum-adsorbed, 22-nm, HBsAg particles that have been
purified from human plasma by a combination of biophysical (ultracentrifugation) and biochemical
procedures. Inactivation is a threefold process using 8M urea, pepsin at pH 2, and 1:4,000 formalin.
These treatment steps have been shown to inactivate representatives of all classes of viruses found in
human blood, including HIV (28). Plasma-derived vaccine is no longer being produced in the United
States, and use is now limited to hemodialysis patients, other immunocompromised hosts, and
persons with known allergy to yeast.
Currently licensed recombinant hepatitis B vaccines are produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(common baker's yeast), into which a plasmid containing the gene for the HBsAg has been inserted.
Purified HBsAg is obtained by lysing the yeast cells and separating HBsAg from yeast components by
biochemical and biophysical techniques. These vaccines contain more than 95% HBsAg protein.
Yeast-derived protein constitutes no more than 5% of the final product.
Hepatitis B vaccines are packaged to contain 10-40 ug HBsAg protein/ml and are adsorbed with
aluminum hydroxide (0.5 mg/ml). Thimerosal (1:20,000 concentration) is added as a preservative.
The recommended series of three intramuscular doses of hepatitis B vaccine induces an adequate
antibody response* in >90% of healthy aduits and in >95%of infants, children, and adolescents from
birth through 19 years of age (29-31). The deltoid (arm) is the recommended site for hepatitis B
vaccination of adults and children; immunogenicity of vaccine for adults is substantially lower when
injections are given in the buttock (32). Larger vaccine doses (two to four times normal adult dose) or
an increased number of doses (four doses) are required to induce protective antibody in a high
proportion of hemodialysis patients and may also be necessary for other immunocompromised
persons (such as those on immunosuppressive drugs or with HIV infection) (33,34).
Field trials of the vaccines licensed in the United States have shown 80%-95% efficacy in preventing
infection or clinical hepatitis among susceptible persons (31,35). Protection against illness is virtually
*An adequate antibody response is >10 millilnternational Units (mIU)/ml, approximately equivalent to 10 sample
ratio units (SRU) by RIA or positive by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), measured 1-6 months after completion of the
vaccine series.

## p. 10 (#232) #############################################

complete for persons who develop an adequate antibody response after vaccination. The duration of
protection and need for booster doses are not yet fully defined. Between 30% and 50% of persons who
develop adequate antibody after three doses of vaccine will lose detectable antibody within 7 years,
but protection against viremic infection and clinical disease appears to persist (36-38 ). Immunogenic-
ity and efficacy of the licensed vaccines for hemodialysis patients are much lower than in normal
adults. Protection in this group may last only as long as adequate antibody levels persist (33).
Vaccine Usage
Primary vaccination comprises three intramuscular doses of vaccine, with the second and third
doses given 1 and 6 months, respectively, after the first. Adults and older children should be given a
full 1.0 ml/dose, while children <11 years of age should usually receive half (0.5 ml) this dose. See
Table 3 for complete information on age-specific dosages of currently available vaccines. An
alternative schedule of four doses of vaccine given at 0, 1, 2, and 12 months has been approved for one
vaccine for postexposure prophylaxis or for more rapid induction of immunity. However, there is no
clear evidence that this regimen provides greater protection than the standard three-dose series.
Hepatitis B vaccine should be given only in the deltoid muscle for adults and children or in the
anterolateral thigh muscle for infants and neonates.
For patients undergoing hemodialysis and for other immunosuppressed patients, higher vaccine
doses or increased numbers of doses are required. A special formulation of one vaccine is now
available for such persons (Table 3). Persons with HIV infection have an impaired response to hepatitis
B vaccine. The immunogenicity of higher doses of vaccine is unknown for this group, and firm
recommendations on dosage cannot be made at this time (34).
Vaccine doses administered at longer intervals provide equally satisfactory protection, but optimal
protection is not conferred until after the third dose. If the vaccine series is interrupted after the first
dose, the second and third doses should be given separated by an interval of 3-5 months. Persons who
are late for the third dose should be given this dose when convenient. Postvaccination testing is not
considered necessary in either situation.
In one study, the response to vaccination by the standard schedule using one or two doses of one
vaccine, followed by the remaining doses of a different vaccine, was comparable to the response to
vaccination with a single vaccine. Moreover, because the immunogenicities of the available vaccines
are similar, it is likely that responses in such situations will be comparable to those induced by any of
the vaccines alone.
The immunogenicity of a series of three low doses (0.1 standard dose) of plasma-derived hepatitis
B vaccine administered by the intradermal route has been assessed in several studies. The largest
studies of adults show lower rates of developing adequate antibody (80%-90%) and twofold to fourfold
lower antibody titers than with intramuscular vaccination with recommended doses (39 and CDC
unpublished data). Data on immunogenicity of low doses of recombinant vaccines given intradermally
are limited. At this time, intradermal vaccination of adults using low doses of vaccine should be done
only under research protocol, with appropriate informed consent and with postvaccination testing to

identify persons with inadequate response who would be eligible for revaccination. Intradermal
vaccination is not recommended for infants or children.
All hepatitis B vaccines are inactivated (noninfective) products, and there is no evidence of
interference with other simultaneously administered vaccines.
Data are not available on the safety of hepatitis B vaccines for the developing fetus. Because the
vaccines contain only noninfectious HBsAg particles, there should be no risk to the fetus. In contrast,
HBV infection of a pregnant woman may result in severe disease for the mother and chronic infection
of the newborn. Therefore, pregnancy or lactation should not be considered a contraindication to the
use of this vaccine for persons who are otherwise eligible.
Vaccine storage and shipment
Vaccine should be shipped and stored at 2 C-8 C but not frozen. Freezing destroys the potency of the
vaccine.
Side effects and adverse reactions
The most common side effect observed following vaccination with each of the available vaccines
has been soreness at the injection site. Postvaccination surveillance for 3 years after licensure of the
plasma-derived vaccine showed an association of borderline significance between Guillain-Barré
syndrome and receipt of the first vaccine dose (40). The rate of this occurrence was very low
(0.5/100,000 vaccinees) and was more than compensated by disease prevented by the vaccine even if
Guillain-Barré syndrome is a true side effect. Such postvaccination surveillance information is not
available for the recombinant hepatitis B vaccines. Early concerns about safety of plasma-derived
vaccine have proven to be unfounded, particularly the concern that infectious agents such as HIV
present in the donor plasma pools might contaminate the final product.
Effect of vaccination on carriers and immune persons
Hepatitis B vaccine produces neither therapeutic nor adverse effects for HBV carriers (41).
Vaccination of individuals who possess antibodies against HBV from a previous infection is not
necessary but will not cause adverse effects. Such individuals will have a postvaccination increase in
their anti-HBs levels. Passively acquired antibody, whether acquired from HBIG or IG administration or
from the transplacental route, will not interfere with active immunization (42).
Prevaccination serologic testing for susceptibility
The decision to test potential vaccine recipients for prior infection is primarily a cost-effectiveness
issue and should be based on whether the costs of testing balance the costs of vaccine saved by not
vaccinating individuals who have already been infected. Estimation of cost-effectiveness of testing
depends on three variables: the cost of vaccination, the cost of testing for susceptibility, and the
expected prevalence of immune individuals in the group.
Testing in groups with the highest risk of HBV infection (HBV marker prevalence >20%, Table 2) is
usually cost-effective unless testing costs are extremely high. Cost-effectiveness of screening may be
marginal for groups at intermediate risk. For groups with a low expected prevalence of HBV serologic
markers, such as health professionals in their training years, prevaccination testing is not cost-
effective.
For routine testing, only one antibody test is necessary (either anti-HBc or anti-HBs). Anti-HBc
identifies all previously infected persons, both carriers and those who are not carriers, but does not
differentiate members of the two groups. Anti-HBs identifies persons previously infected, except for
carriers. Neither test has a particular advantage for groups expected to have carrier rates of <2%, such
as health-care workers. Anti-HBc may be preferred to avoid unnecessary vaccination of carriers for
groups with higher carrier rates. If RIA is used to test for anti-HBs, a minimum of 10 sample ratio units
should be used to designate immunity (2.1 is the usual designation of a positive test). If EIA is used, the
positive level recommended by manufacturers is appropriate.
Postvaccination testing for serologic response and revaccination of nonresponders
Hepatitis B vaccine, when given in the deltoid, produces protective antibody (anti-HBs) in >90% of
healthy persons. Testing for immunity after vaccination is not recommended routinely but is advised
for persons whose subsequent management depends on knowing their immune status (such as
dialysis patients and staff). Testing for immunity is also advised for persons for whom a suboptimal
response may be anticipated, such as those who have received vaccine in the buttock, persons >50
years of age, and persons known to have HIV infection. Postvaccination testing should also be
11


## p. 12 (#234) #############################################

considered for persons at occupational risk who may have needle-stick exposures necessitating
postexposure prophylaxis. When necessary, postvaccination testing should be done between 1 and 6
months after completion of the vaccine series to provide definitive information on response to the
vaccine.
Revaccination of persons who do not respond to the primary series (nonresponders) produces
adequate antibody in 15%-25% after one additional dose and in 30%-50% after three additional doses
when the primary vaccination has been given in the deltoid (36). For persons who did not respond to
a primary vaccine series given in the buttock, data suggest that revaccination in the arm induces
adequate antibody in >75%. Revaccination with one or more additional doses should be considered
for persons who fail to respond to vaccination in the deltoid and is recommended for those who have
failed to respond to vaccination in the buttock.
Need for vaccine booster doses
Available data show that vaccine-induced antibody levels decline steadily with time and that up to
50% of adult vaccinees who respond adequately to vaccine may have low or undetectable antibody
levels by 7 years after vaccination. Nevertheless, both adults and children with declining antibody
levels are still protected against hepatitis B disease. Current data also suggest excellent protection
against disease for 5 years after vaccination among infants born to hepatitis B-carrier mothers. For
adults and children with normal immune status, booster doses are not routinely recommended within
7 years after vaccination, nor is routine serologic testing to assess antibody levels necessary for
vaccine recipients during this period. For infants born to hepatitis B-carrier mothers, booster doses are
not necessary within 5 years after vaccination. The possible need for booster doses after longer
intervals will be assessed as additional information becomes available.
For hemodialysis patients, for whom vaccine-induced protection is less complete and may persist
only as long as antibody levels remain above 10 mlU/ml, the need for booster doses should be
assessed by annual antibody testing, and booster doses should be given when antibody levels decline
to <10 mlU/ml.
Groups recommended for preexposure vaccination
Persons at substantial risk of HBV infection who are demonstrated or judged likely to be susceptible
should be vaccinated. They include the following:
1. Persons with occupational risk. HBV infection is a major infectious occupational hazard for
health-care and public-safety workers. The risk of acquiring HBV infection from occupational
exposures is dependent on the frequency of percutaneous and permucosal exposures to blood
or blood products. Any health-care or public-safety worker may be at risk for HBV exposure
depending on the tasks that he or she performs. If those tasks involve contact with blood or
blood-contaminated body fluids, such workers should be vaccinated. Vaccination should be
considered for other workers depending on the nature of the task (43).
Risks among health-care professionals vary during the training and working career of each
individual but are often highest during the professional training period. For this reason, when
possible, vaccination should be completed during training in schools of medicine, dentistry,
nursing, laboratory technology, and other allied health professions before workers have their
first contact with blood.
2. Clients and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled. Susceptible clients in
institutions for the developmentally disabled should be vaccinated. Staff who work closely with
clients should also be vaccinated. The risk in institutional environments is associated not only
with blood exposure but may also be consequent to bites and contact with skin lesions and other
infective secretions. Susceptible clients and staff who live or work in smaller (group) residential
settings with known HBV carriers should also receive hepatitis B vaccine. Clients discharged
from residential institutions into community settings should be screened for HBsAg so that the
community programs may take appropriate measures to prevent HBV transmission. These
measures should include both environmental controls and appropriate use of vaccine.
Staff of nonresidential day-care programs (e.g., schools, sheltered workshops for the devel-
opmentally disabled) attended by known HBV carriers have a risk of HBV infection comparable
to that among health-care workers and therefore should be vaccinated (44). The risk of HBV
infection for clients appears to be lower than the risk for staff. Vaccination of clients in day-care
programs may be considered. Vaccination of classroom contacts is strongly encouraged if a
classmate who is an HBV carrier behaves aggressively or has special medical problems that
increase the risk of exposure to his/her blood or serous secretions.

3. Hemodialysis patients. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for susceptible hemodialysis
patients. Although seroconversion rates and anti-HBs titers are lower than those for healthy
persons, for those patients who do respond, hepatitis B vaccine will protect them from HBV
infection and reduce the necessity for frequent serologic screening (45). Some studies have
shown higher seroconversion rates and antibody titers for patients with uremia who were
vaccinated before they required dialysis (46). Identification of patients for vaccination early in
the course of their renal disease is encouraged.
4. Sexually active homosexual men. Susceptible sexually active homosexual men should be
vaccinated regardless of their age or the duration of their homosexual practices. Persons should
be vaccinated as soon as possible after their homosexual activity begins. Homosexual and
bisexual men known to have HIV infection should be tested for anti-HBs response after
completion of the vaccine series and should be counseled accordingly.
5. Users of illicit injectable drugs. All users of illicit injectable drugs who are susceptible to HBV
should be vaccinated as early as possible after their drug abuse begins.
6. Recipients of certain blood products. Patients with clotting disorders who receive clotting-factor
concentrates have an increased risk of HBV infection. Vaccination is recommended for these
persons, and it should be initiated at the time their specific clotting disorder is identified.
Prevaccination testing is recommended for patients who have already received multiple
infusions of these products.
7. Household and sexual contacts of HBV carriers. Household contacts of HBV carriers are at high
risk of HBV infection. Sexual contacts appear to be at greatest risk. When HBV carriers are
identified through routine screening of donated blood, diagnostic testing in hospitals, prenatal
screening, screening of refugees from certain areas, or other screening programs, they should
be notified of their status. All household and sexual contacts should be tested and susceptible
contacts vaccinated.
8. Adoptees from countries of high HBV endemicity. Families accepting orphans or unaccompanied
minors from countries of high or intermediate HBV endemicity should have the children screened
for HBsAg. If the children are HBsAg-positive, family members should be vaccinated (47).
9. Other contacts of HBV carriers. Persons in casual contact with carriers in settings such as
schools and offices are at minimal risk of HBV infection, and vaccine is not routinely
recommended for them. At child-care centers, HBV transmission between children or between
children and staff has rarely been documented. Unless special circumstances exist, such as
behavior problems (biting or scratching) or medical conditions (severe skin disease) that might
facilitate transmission, vaccination of contacts of carriers in child care is not indicated.
10. Populations with high endemicity of HBV infection. In certain U.S. populations, including
Alaskan Natives, Pacific Islanders, and refugees from HBV-endemic areas, HBV infection is
highly endemic, and transmission occurs primarily during childhood. In such groups, universal
hepatitis B vaccination of infants is recommended to prevent disease transmission during
childhood. In addition, more extensive programs of "catch-up" childhood vaccination should be
considered if resources are available.
Immigrants and refugees from areas with highly endemic HBV disease (particularly Africa and
eastern Asia) should be screened for HBV markers upon resettlement in the United States. If an
HBV carrier is identified, all susceptible household contacts should be vaccinated. Even if no
HBV carriers are found within a family, vaccination should be considered for susceptible
children <7 years of age because of the high rate of interfamilial HBV infection that occurs
among these children (48). Vaccination is recommended for all infants of women who were born
in areas in which infection is highly endemic.
11. Inmates of long-term correctional facilities. The prison environment may provide a favorable
setting for the transmission of HBV because of the use of illicit injectable drugs and because of
male homosexual practices. Moreover, it provides an access point for vaccination of percuta-
neous drug abusers. Prison officials should consider undertaking screening and vaccination
programs directed at inmates with histories of high-risk behaviors.
12. Sexually active heterosexual persons. Sexually active heterosexual persons with multiple sexual
partners are at increased risk of HBV infection. Risk increases with increasing numbers of sexual
partners. Vaccination is recommended for persons who are diagnosed as having recently
acquired other sexually transmitted diseases, for prostitutes, and for persons who have a history
of sexual activity with multiple partners in the previous 6 months.
13

13. International travelers. Vaccination should be considered for persons who plan to reside for
more than 6 months in areas with high levels of endemic HBV and who will have close contact
with the local population. Vaccination should also be considered for short-term travelers who
are likely to have contact with blood from or sexual contact with residents of areas with high
levels of endemic disease. Ideally, hepatitis B vaccination of travelers should begin at least 6
months before travel to allow for completion of the full vaccine series. Nevertheless, a partial
series will offer some protection from HBV infection. The alternative four-dose schedule may
provide better protection during travel if the first three doses can be delivered before travel
(second and third doses given 1 and 2 months, respectively, after first).
Postexposure Prophylaxis for Hepatitis B
Prophylactic treatment to prevent hepatitis B infection after exposure to HBV should be considered
in the following situations: perinatal exposure of an infant born to an HBsAg-positive mother,
accidental percutaneous or permucosal exposure to HBsAg-positive blood, sexual exposure to an
HBsAg-positive person, and household exposure of an infant <12 months of age to a primary care
giver who has acute hepatitis B.
Various studies have established the relative efficacies of HBIG and/or hepatitis B vaccine in different
exposure situations. For an infant with perinatal exposure to an HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-positive
mother, a regimen combining one dose of HBIG at birth with the hepatitis B vaccine series started soon
after birth is 85%-95% effective in preventing development of the HBV carrier state (35,49-51 ).
Regimens involving either multiple doses of HBIG alone, or the vaccine series alone, have 70%-85%
efficacy (52,53).
For accidental percutaneous exposure, only regimens including HBIG and/or IG have been studied.
A regimen of two doses of HBIG, one given after exposure and one a month later, is about 75%
effective in preventing hepatitis B in this setting (54,55 ). For sexual exposure, a single dose of HBIG is
75% effective if given within 2 weeks of last sexual exposure (56). The efficacy of IG for postexposure
prophylaxis is uncertain. IG no longer has a role in postexposure prophylaxis of hepatitis B because of
the availability of HBIG and the wider use of hepatitis B vaccine.
Recommendations on postexposure prophylaxis are based on available efficacy data and on the
likelihood of future HBV exposure of the person requiring treatment. In all exposures, a regimen
combining HBIG with hepatitis B vaccine will provide both short- and long-term protection, will be less
costly than the two-dose HBIG treatment alone, and is the treatment of choice.
Perinatal Exposure and Recommendations
Transmission of HBV from mother to infant during the perinatal period represents one of the most
efficient modes of HBV infection and often leads to severe long-term sequelae. Infants born to
HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-positive mothers have a 70%-90% chance of acquiring perinatal HBV
infection, and 85%-90% of infected infants will become chronic HBV carriers. Estimates are that >25%
of these carriers will die from primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) or cirrhosis of the liver (57).
Infants born to HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-negative mothers have a lower risk of acquiring perinatal
infection; however, such infants have had acute disease, and fatal fulminant hepatitis has been
reported (58,59). Based on 1987 data in the United States, an estimated 18,000 births occur to
HBsAg-positive women each year, resulting in approximately 4,000 infants who become chronic HBV
carriers. Prenatal screening of all pregnant women identifies those who are HBsAg-positive and allows
treatment of their newborns with HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine, a regimen that is 85%-95% effective in
preventing the development of the HBV chronic carrier state.
The following are perinatal recommendations:
1. All pregnant women should be routinely tested for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit in each
pregnancy. This testing should be done at the same time that other routine prenatal screening
tests are ordered. In special situations (e.g., when acute hepatitis is suspected, when a history of
exposure to hepatitis has been reported, or when the mother has a particularly high-risk behavior,
such as intravenous drug abuse), an additional HBsAg test can be ordered later in the pregnancy.
No other HBV marker tests are necessary for the purpose of maternal screening, although
HBsAg-positive mothers identified during screening may have HBV-related acute or chronic liver
disease and should be evaluated by their physicians.
2. If a woman has not been screened prenatally or if test results are not available at the time of
admission for delivery, HBsAg testing should be done at the time of admission, or as soon as
14


## p. 15 (#237) #############################################

possible thereafter. If the mother is identified as HBsAg-positive >1 month after giving birth, the
infant should be tested for HBsAg. If the results are negative, the infant should be given HBIG and
hepatitis B vaccine.
3. Following all initial positive tests for HBsAg, a repeat test for HBsAg should be performed on the
same specimen, followed by a confirmatory test using a neutralization assay. For women in labor
who did not have HBsAg testing during pregnancy and who are found to be HBsAg-positive on
first testing, initiation of treatment of their infants should not be delayed by more than 24 hours
for repeat or confirmatory testing.
4. Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive HBIG (0.5 ml) intramuscularly once they
are physiologically stable, preferably within 12 hours of birth (Table 4). Hepatitis B vaccine should
be administered intramuscularly at the appropriate infant dose. The first dose should be given
concurrently with HBIG but at a different site. If vaccine is not immediately available, the first dose
should be given as soon as possible. Subsequent doses should be given as recommended for the
specific vaccine. Testing infants for HBsAg and anti-HBs is recommended when they are 12-15
months of age to monitor the success or failure of therapy. If HBsAg is not detectable and
anti-HBs is present, children can be considered protected. Testing for anti-HBc is not useful, since
maternal anti-HBc can persist for > 1 year. HBIG and hepatitis B vaccination do not interfere with
routine childhood vaccinations. Breast-feeding poses no risk of HBV infection for infants who
have begun prophylaxis.
5. Household members and sexual partners of HBV carriers identified through prenatal screening
should be tested to determine susceptibility to HBV infection, and, if susceptible, should receive
hepatitis B vaccine.
6. Obstetric and pediatric staff should be notified directly about HBsAg-positive mothers so that
neonates can receive therapy without delay after birth and follow-up doses of vaccine can be
given. Programs to coordinate the activities of persons providing prenatal care, hospital-based
obstetrical services, and pediatric well-baby care must be established to assure proper follow-up
and treatment both of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers and of other susceptible
household and sexual contacts.
7. In those populations under U.S. jurisdiction in which hepatitis B infection is highly endemic
(including certain Alaskan Natives, Pacific Island groups, and refugees from highly endemic areas
accepted for resettlement in the United States), universal vaccination of newborns with hepatitis
B vaccine is the recommended strategy for hepatitis B control. HBsAg screening of mothers and
use of HBIG for infants born to HBV-carrier mothers may be added to routine hepatitis B
vaccination when practical, but screening and HBIG alone will not adequately protect children
from HBV infection in endemic areas. In such areas, hepatitis B vaccine doses should be
integrated into the childhood vaccination schedule. More extensive programs of childhood
hepatitis B vaccination should be considered if resources are available.
Acute Exposure to Blood That Contains (or Might Contain) HBsAg
For accidental percutaneous (needle stick, laceration, or bite) or permucosal (ocular or mucous-
membrane) exposure to blood, the decision to provide prophylaxis must include consideration of
several factors: a) whether the source of the blood is available, b) the HBsAg status of the source, and
c) the hepatitis B vaccination and vaccine-response status of the exposed person. Such exposures
usually affect persons for whom hepatitis B vaccine is recommended. For any exposure of a person not
previously vaccinated, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended.

## p. 16 (#238) #############################################

Following any such exposure, a blood sample should be obtained from the person who was the
source of the exposure and should be tested for HBsAg. The hepatitis B vaccination status and anti-HBs
response status (if known) of the exposed person should be reviewed. The outline below and Table 5
summarize prophylaxis for percutaneous or permucosal exposure to blood according to the HBsAg
status of the source of exposure and the vaccination status and vaccine response of the exposed
person.
For greatest effectiveness, passive prophylaxis with HBIG, when indicated, should be given as soon
as possible after exposure (its value beyond 7 days after exposure is unclear).
1. Source of exposure HBsAg-positive
a. Exposed person has not been vaccinated or has not completed vaccination. Hepatitis B
vaccination should be initiated. A single dose of HBIG (0.06 ml/kg) should be given as soon as
possible after exposure and within 24 hours, if possible. The first dose of hepatitis B vaccine
(Table 3) should be given intramuscularly at a separate site (deltoid for adults) and can be
given simultaneously with HBIG or within 7 days of exposure. Subsequent doses should be
given as recommended for the specific vaccine. If the exposed person has begun but not
completed vaccination, one dose of HBIG should be given immediately, and vaccination
should be completed as scheduled.
b. Exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, and anti-HBs response status
is known.
(1) If the exposed person is known to have had adequate response in the past, the anti-HBs
level should be tested unless an adequate level has been demonstrated within the last 24
months. Although current data show that vaccine-induced protection does not decrease as
antibody level wanes, most experts consider the following approach to be prudent.
a) If anti-HBs level is adequate, no treatment is necessary.
b) If anti-HBs level is inadequate,* a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be given.
(2) If the exposed person is known not to have responded to the primary vaccine series, the
exposed person should be given either a single dose of HBIG and a dose of hepatitis B
vaccine as soon as possible after exposure, or two doses of HBIG (0.06 ml/kg), one given as
soon as possible after exposure and the second 1 month later. The latter treatment is
preferred for those who have failed to respond to at least four doses of vaccine.
c. Exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, and the anti-HBs response is
unknown. The exposed person should be tested for anti-HBs.
*An adequate antibody level is >10 millilnternational Units (mlU)/ml, approximately equivalent to 10 sample ratio
units (SRU) by RIA or positive by EIA.

(1) If the exposed person has adequate antibody, no additional treatment is necessary.
(2) If the exposed person has inadequate antibody on testing, one dose of HBIG (0.06 ml/kg)
should be given immediately and a standard booster dose of vaccine (Table 3) given at a
different site.
2. Source of exposure known and HBsAg-negative
a. Exposed person has not been vaccinated or has not completed vaccination. If unvaccinated,
the exposed person should be given the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 7 days of
exposure, and vaccination should be completed as recommended. If the exposed person has
not completed vaccination, vaccination should be completed as scheduled.
b. Exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B. No treatment is necessary.
3. Source of exposure unknown or not available for testing
a. Exposed person has not been vaccinated or has not completed vaccination. If unvaccinated,
the exposed person should be given the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 7 days of
exposure and vaccination completed as recommended. If the exposed person has not
completed vaccination, vaccination should be completed as scheduled.
b. Exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, and anti-HBs response status
is known.
(1) If the exposed person is known to have had adequate response in the past, no treatment is
necessary.
(2) If the exposed person is known not to have responded to the vaccine, prophylaxis as
described earlier in section 1.b.(2) under "Source of exposure HBsAg-positive" may be
considered if the source of the exposure is known to be at high risk of HBV infection.
c. Exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, and the anti-HBs response is
unknown. The exposed person should be tested for anti-HBs.
(1) If the exposed person has adequate anti-HBs, no treatment is necessary.
(2) If the exposed person has inadequate anti-HBs, a standard booster dose of vaccine should
be given.
Sexual Partners of Persons with Acute HBV Infection
Sexual partners of HBsAg-positive persons are at increased risk of acquiring HBV infection, and
HBIG has been shown to be 75% effective in preventing such infections (56). Because data are limited,
the period after sexual exposure during which HBIG is effective is unknown, but extrapolation from
other settings makes it unlikely that this period would exceed 14 days. Before treatment, testing of
sexual partners for susceptibility is recommended if it does not delay treatment beyond 14 days after
last exposure. Testing for anti-HBc is the most efficient prescreening test to use in this population.
All susceptible persons whose sexual partners have acute hepatitis B infection or whose sexual
partners are discovered to be hepatitis B carriers should receive a single dose of HBIG (0.06 ml/kg) and
should begin the hepatitis B vaccine series if prophylaxis can be started within 14 days of the last
sexual contact, or if ongoing sexual contact with the infected person will occur. Giving the vaccine with
HBIG may improve the efficacy of postexposure treatment. The vaccine has the added advantage of
conferring long-lasting protection.
An alternative treatment for persons who are not from a high-risk group for whom vaccine is
routinely recommended and whose regular sexual partners have acute HBV infection is to give one
dose of HBIG (without vaccine) and retest the sexual partner for HBsAg 3 months later. No further
treatment is necessary if the sexual partner becomes HBsAg-negative. If the sexual partner remains
HBsAg-positive, a second dose of HBIG should be given and the hepatitis B vaccine series started.
Household Contacts of Persons with Acute HBV Infection
Since infants have close contact with primary care givers and they have a higher risk of becoming
HBV carriers after acute HBV infection, prophylaxis of an infant <12 months of age with HBIG (0.5 ml)
and hepatitis B vaccine is indicated if the mother or primary care giver has acute HBV infection.
Prophylaxis for other household contacts of persons with acute HBV infection is not indicated unless
they have had identifiable blood exposure to the index patient, such as by sharing toothbrushes or
razors. Such exposures should be treated similarly to sexual exposures. If the index patient becomes
an HBV carrier, all household contacts should be given hepatitis B vaccine.

DELTA HEPATITIS
The delta virus (also known as hepatitis D virus (HDV]) is a defective virus that may cause infection
only in the presence of active HBV infection. The HDV is a 35- to 37-nm viral particle, consisting of
single-stranded RNA (mw 500,000) and an internal protein antigen (delta antigen (HDAg]), coated with
HBsAg as the surface protein (5). Infection may occur as either coinfection with HBV or superinfection
of an HBV carrier, each of which usually causes an episode of clinical acute hepatitis. Coinfection
usually resolves, whereas superinfection frequently causes chronic HDV infection and chronic active
hepatitis. Both types of infection may cause fulminant hepatitis.
HDV infection may be diagnosed by detecting HDAg in serum during early infection and by the
appearance of total or IgM-specific delta antibody (anti-HDV) during or after infection. A test for
detection of total anti-HDV is commercially available. Other tests (HDAg, IgM anti-HDV) are available
only in research laboratories.
Routes of transmission of HDV are similar to those of HBV. In the United States, HDV infection most
commonly affects persons at high risk of HBV infection, particularly parenteral drug abusers and
persons with hemophilia.
Since HDV is dependent on HBV for replication, prevention of hepatitis B infection, either
preexposure or postexposure, will suffice to prevent HDV infection for a person susceptible to hepatitis
B. Known episodes of perinatal, sexual, or percutaneous exposure to serum or exposure to persons
known to be positive for both HBV and HDV should be treated exactly as such exposures to HBV alone.
Persons who are HBsAg carriers are at risk of HDV infection, especially if they participate in activities
that put them at high risk of repeated exposure to HBV (parenteral drug abuse, male homosexual
activity). However, at present no products are available that might prevent HDV infection in HBsAg
carriers either before or after exposure.
NON-A, NON-B HEPATITIS
Parenterally Transmitted (PT) Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis
Parenterally transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis accounts for 20%-40% of acute viral hepatitis in the
United States and has epidemiologic characteristics similar to those of hepatitis B (60). Recently, a
portion of the genome of a virus thought to be responsible for PT non-A, non-B hepatitis was cloned
(2). A candidate serologic assay for antibody to this virus (proposed as hepatitis C virus) has been
developed. This assay appears to detect a substantial number of persons with chronic infection and is
being evaluated for screening potential blood donors (3). Although PT non-A, non-B hepatitis has
traditionally been considered a transfusion-associated disease, most reported cases have not been
associated with blood transfusion (61-64). Groups at high risk of acquiring this disease include
transfusion recipients, parenteral drug users, and dialysis patients (62,63). Health-care work that
entails frequent contact with blood, personal contact with others who have had hepatitis in the past,
and contact with infected persons within households have also been documented in some studies as
risk factors for acquiring PT non-A, non-B hepatitis (63-65 ). However, the role of person-to-person
contact in disease transmission has not been well defined, and the importance of sexual activity in the
transmission of this type of hepatitis is unclear.
Multiple episodes of non-A, non-B hepatitis have been observed among the same individuals and
may be due to different bloodborne agents. An average of 50% of patients who have acute PT non-A,
non-B hepatitis infection later develop chronic hepatitis (66). Experimental studies of chimpanzees
have confirmed the existence of a carrier state, which may be present in 1%-3% of the population
(67,68 ).
The risk and consequences of perinatal transmission of PT non-A, non-B hepatitis are not well
defined. Only one small study has been published in which infants born of 12 women who had acute
PT non-A, non-B hepatitis during pregnancy were followed. Six infants developed transient alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) elevations at 4-8 weeks of age (69).
The results have been equivocal in several studies attempting to assess the value of prophylaxis
with IGs against PT non-A, non-B hepatitis (70-72 ). For persons with percutaneous exposure to blood
from a patient with PT non-A, non-B hepatitis, it may be reasonable to administer IG (0.06 ml/kg) as
soon as possible after exposure. In other circumstances, no specific recommendations can be made.

Enterically Transmitted (ET) Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis
A distinct type of non-A, non-B hepatitis acquired by the fecal-oral route was first identified through
investigations of large waterborne epidemics in developing countries. This Et non-A, non-B hepatitis,
which has occurred in epidemics or sporadically in parts of Asia, North and West Africa, and Mexico,
is serologically distinct from other known hepatitis viruses (4,73). Young to middle-aged adults are
most often affected, with an unusually high mortality among pregnant women. The disease has been
transmitted to experimental animals, and candidate viruses have been identified; however, no
serologic tests have yet been developed (74).
ET non-A, non-B hepatitis has not been recognized as an endemic disease in the United States or
Western Europe, and it is unknown whether the causative agent is present in these areas. Cases have
been documented, however, among persons returning from travel to countries in which this disease
occurs (75).
Travelers to areas having ET non-A, non-B hepatitis may be at some risk of acquiring this disease by
close contact with infected persons or by consuming contaminated food or water. There is no evidence
that U.S.-manufactured IG will prevent this infection. As with hepatitis A and other enteric infections,
the best means of preventing ET non-A, non-B hepatitis is avoiding potentially contaminated food or
water.

Hepatitis B Virus: A Comprehensive Strategy for
Eliminating Transmission in the
United States Through Universal
Childhood Vaccination
Recommendations of the Immunization Practices
Advisory Committee (ACIP)
The following statement updates all previous recommendations on protection against hepatitis B
virus infection, including use of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin for prophylaxis
against hepatitis B virus infection (MMWR 1985;34:313-24,329-35, MMWR 1987;36:353-66, and
MMWR 1990;39 (No.RR-2]:8-19) and universal screening of pregnant women to prevent peri-
natal hepatitis B virus transmission (MMWR 1988;37:341-46,51, and MMWR 1990;39[No.RR-2]:8-19).
Recommendations concerning the prevention of other types of viral hepatitis are found in MMWR
1990;39(No.RR-2):1-8, 22-26.
This document provides the rationale for a comprehensive strategy to eliminate transmission of
hepatitis B virus in the United States. This prevention strategy includes making hepatitis B vaccine a
part of routine vaccination schedules for all infants.
INTRODUCTION
The acute and chronic consequences of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are major health problems
in the United States. The reported incidence of acute hepatitis B increased by 37% from 1979 to 1989,
and an estimated 200,000-300,000 new infections occurred annually during the period 1980–1991. The
estimated 1 million-1.25 million persons with chronic HBV infection in the United States are potentially
infectious to others. In addition, many chronically infected persons are at risk of long-term sequelae,
such as chronic liver disease and primary hepatocellular carcinoma; each year approximately
4,000-5,000 of these persons die from chronic liver disease (1).
Immunization with hepatitis B vaccine is the most effective means of preventing HBV infection and
its consequences. In the United States, most infections occur among adults and adolescents (2,3). The
recommended strategy for preventing these infections has been the selective vaccination of persons
with identified risk factors (1,2). However, this strategy has not lowered the incidence of hepatitis B,
primarily because vaccinating persons engaged in high-risk behaviors, life-styles, or occupations
before they become infected generally has not been feasible. In addition, many infected persons have
no identifiable source for their infections and thus cannot be targeted for vaccination (2).
Preventing HBV transmission during early childhood is important because of the high likelihood of
chronic HBV infection and chronic liver disease that occurs when children less than 5 years of age
become infected (3). Testing to identify pregnant women who are hepatitis B surface antigen(HBsAg)-
positive and providing their infants with immunoprophylaxis effectively prevents HBV transmission
during the perinatal period (4,5). Integrating hepatitis B vaccine into childhood vaccination schedules
in populations with high rates of childhood infection (e.g., Alaskan Natives and Pacific Islanders) has
been shown to interrupt HBV transmission (6).
This document provides the rationale for a comprehensive strategy to eliminate transmission of
HBV and ultimately reduce the incidence of hepatitis B and hepatitis B-associated chronic liver disease
in the United States. The recommendations for implementing this strategy include making hepatitis B
vaccine a part of routine vaccination schedules for infants.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PREVENTION OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTION
Infections among Infants and Children
In the United States, children become infected with HBV through a variety of means. The risk of
perinatal HBV infection among infants born to HBV-infected mothers ranges from 10% to 85%,
depending on each mother's hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status (3,7,8). Infants who become infected
by perinatal transmission have a 90% risk of chronic infection, and up to 25% will die of chronic liver
disease as adults (9). Even when not infected during the perinatal period, children of HBV-infected
mothers remain at high risk of acquiring chronic HBV infection by person-to-person (horizontal)
transmission during the first 5 years of life ( 10 ). More than 90% of these infections can be prevented
if HBsAg-positive mothers are identified so that their infants can receive hepatitis B vaccine and
hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) soon after birth (4,5).
Because screening selected pregnant women for HBsAg has failed to identify a high proportion of
HBV-infected mothers (11,12), prenatal HBsAg testing of all pregnant women is now recommended
(1,13,14). Universal prenatal testing would identify an estimated 22,000 HBsAg-positive women and
could prevent at least 6,000 chronic HBV infections annually (3). Screening and vaccination programs
for women and infants receiving care in the public sector have already been initiated through state
immunization projects.
Horizontal transmission of HBV during the first 5 years of life occurs frequently in populations in
which HBV infection is endemic. The risk of chronic infection is age dependent, ranging from 30% to
60% for children 1-5 years of age (15). Worldwide, it has been recommended that, in populations in
which HBV infection is acquired during childhood, hepatitis B vaccine should be integrated into routine
vaccination schedules for infants, usually as a part of the World Health Organization's Expanded
Programme on Immunization ( 16 ). In the United States, racial/ethnic groups shown to have high rates
of childhood HBV infection include Alaskan Natives (6,17), Pacific Islanders (18), and infants of
first-generation immigrant mothers from parts of the world where HBV infection is endemic, especially
Asia (19,20 ). Vaccination programs to prevent perinatal, childhood, and adult HBV infections among
Alaskan Natives were begun in late 1982; as a result, the incidence of acute hepatitis B in this
population has declined by over 99% (6). Hepatitis B vaccine was integrated into vaccination schedules
for infants in American Samoa beginning in 1986 and by 1990 was incorporated into the schedules of
the remaining Pacific Islands under U.S. jurisdiction.
Each year, approximately 150,000 infants are born to women who have immigrated to the United
States from areas of the world where HBV infection is highly endemic (3). Children born to
HBsAg-positive mothers can be identified through prenatal screening programs. However, children
born to HBsAg-negative immigrant mothers are still at high risk of acquiring HBV infection, usually
from other HBV carriers in their families or communities (3,19,20 ). Infections among these children can
be prevented by making hepatitis B vaccine part of their routine infant vaccinations (1).
Infections among Adolescents and Adults
In the United States most persons with hepatitis B acquire the infection as adolescents or adults.
Several specific modes of transmission have been identified, including sexual contact, especially
among homosexual men and persons with multiple heterosexual partners; parenteral drug use;
occupational exposures; household contact with a person who has an acute infection or with a chronic
carrier; receipt of certain blood products; and hemodialysis. However, over one-third of patients with
acute hepatitis B do not have readily identifiable risk factors (1,2).
The rates of HBV infection differ significantly among various racial and ethnic groups (2,21 ). For
example, the prevalence of infection among adolescents and adults has been shown to be threefold to
fourfold greater for blacks than for whites and to be associated with serologic evidence of previous
infection with syphilis (21,22 ).
Efforts to vaccinate persons in the major risk groups have had limited success. For example,
programs directed at injecting drug users failed to motivate them to receive three doses of vaccine
(CDC, unpublished data). Health-care providers are often not aware of groups at high risk of HBV
infection and frequently do not identify candidates for vaccination during routine health-care visits
(CDC, unpublished data). In addition, there has been limited vaccination of susceptible household and
sexual contacts of HBsAg carriers identified in screening programs for blood donors (23). Hepatitis B
vaccination of health-care workers appears to have resulted in a substantial decrease in the rate of
disease in this group, but has had little effect on overall rates of hepatitis B (2). Moreover, to achieve
2


## p. 3 (#251) ##############################################

widespread vaccination of persons at occupational risk, regulations have had to be developed to
ensure implementation of vaccination programs (24).
Educational programs to reduce parenteral drug use and unprotected sexual activity are important
components of the strategy to prevent infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which
causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. These programs appear to have reduced the risk of HBV
infections among homosexual men but have not had an impact on hepatitis B attributable to parenteral
drug use or heterosexual transmission (2). Educational efforts alone are not likely to fully eliminate the
high-risk behaviors responsible for HBV transmission.
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PREVENTION OF HEPATITIS DELTA VIRUS INFECTION
Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a defective virus that causes infection only in the presence of active
HBV infection (25). HDV infection occurs as either coinfection with HBV or superinfection of an HBV
carrier. Coinfection usually resolves; superinfection, however, frequently causes chronic HDV infection
and chronic active hepatitis. Both types of infection may cause fulminant hepatitis.
Routes of transmission are similar to those of HBV. In the United States, HDV infection most
commonly affects persons at high risk of HBV infection, particularly injecting drug users and persons
receiving clotting factor concentrates (26 ). Preventing acute and chronic HBV infection of susceptible
persons will also prevent HDV infection.
STRATEGY TO ELIMINATE HEPATITIS B VIRUS TRANSMISSION
A comprehensive strategy to prevent HBV infection, acute hepatitis B, and the sequelae of HBV
infection in the United States must eliminate transmission that occurs during infancy and childhood,
as well as during adolescence and adulthood. In the United States it has become evident that HBV
transmission cannot be prevented through vaccinating only the groups at high risk of infection. No
current medical treatment will reliably eliminate chronic HBV infection and thus eliminate the source
of new infections in susceptible persons (27). Therefore, new infections can be prevented only by
immunizing susceptible persons with hepatitis B vaccine. Routine visits for prenatal and well-child care
can be used to target hepatitis B prevention. A comprehensive prevention strategy includes a) prenatal
testing of pregnant women for HBsAg to identify newborns who require immunoprophylaxis for the
prevention of perinatal infection and to identify household contacts who should be vaccinated,
b) routine vaccination of children born to HBsAg-negative mothers, c) vaccination of certain adoles-
cents, and d) vaccination of adults at high risk of infection.
Infants and children can receive hepatitis B vaccine during routine health-care visits; no additional
visits would be required. Costs include that of the vaccine and the incremental expense associated with
delivering an additional vaccine during a scheduled health-care visit. Implementation of this immuni-
zation strategy would be greatly facilitated by the development and use of multiple-antigen vaccines
(e.g., diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis(DTP]/hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate/hepatitis
B). These vaccines would reduce the number of injections received by the infant, reduce the cost of
administration, and greatly facilitate widespread vaccine delivery.
Since most HBV infections occur among adults, disease control could be accelerated by vaccinating
emerging at-risk populations, such as adolescents and susceptible contacts of chronic HBV carriers.
The recommendation for universal infant vaccination neither precludes vaccinating adults identified to
be at high risk of infection nor alters previous recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis for
hepatitis B (1).
The reduction in acute hepatitis B and hepatitis B-associated chronic liver disease resulting from
universal infant vaccination may not become apparent for a number of years. However, universal
HBsAg screening of pregnant women to prevent perinatal HBV infection has been shown to be cost
saving (28, CDC, unpublished data), and the estimated cost of universal hepatitis B vaccination for
infants is less than the direct medical and work-loss costs associated with the estimated 5% lifetime
risk of infection (CDC, unpublished data). Currently, the cost of an infant's dose of hepatitis B vaccine
delivered in the public sector is about the same as each of the other childhood vaccinations.
Vaccinating adolescents and adults is substantially more expensive because of the higher vaccine cost
and the higher implementation costs of delivering vaccine to target populations. In the long term,
universal infant vaccination would eliminate the need for vaccinating adolescents and high-risk adults.

PROPHYLAXIS AGAINST HEPATITIS B VIRUS INFECTION
Two types of products are available for prophylaxis against HBV infection. Hepatitis B vaccine, which
provides long-term protection against HBV infection, is recommended for both preexposure and
postexposure prophylaxis. HBIG provides temporary protection (i.e., 3-6 months) and is indicated only
in certain postexposure settings.
Hepatitis B Immune Globulin
HBIG is prepared from plasma known to contain a high titer of antibody against HBsAg (anti-HBs).
In the United States, HBIG has an anti-HBs titer of >100,000 by radioimmunoassay. The human plasma
from which HBIG is prepared is screened for antibodies to HIV; in addition, the process used to prepare
HBIG inactivates and eliminates HIV from the final product. There is no evidence that HIV can be
transmitted by HBIG (29,30 ).
Hepatitis B Vaccine
Two types of hepatitis B vaccine have been licensed in the United States. One, which was
manufactured from the plasma of chronically infected persons, is no longer produced in the United
States. The currently available vaccines are produced by recombinant DNA technology.
The recombinant vaccines are produced by using HBsAg synthesized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(common bakers' yeast), into which a plasmid containing the gene for HBsAg has been inserted.
Purified HBsAg is obtained by lysing the yeast cells and separating HBsAg from the yeast components
by biochemical and biophysical techniques. Hepatitis B vaccines are packaged to contain 10-40 ug of
HBsAg protein/mL after adsorption to aluminum hydroxide (0.5 mg/mL); thimerosal (1:20,000
concentration) is added as a preservative.
Routes and sites of administration.
The recommended series of three intramuscular doses of hepatitis B vaccine induces a protective
antibody response (anti-HBs >10 milli-international units (mlU]/mL) in >90% of healthy adults and in
>95% of infants, children, and adolescents (31-33). Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered only in
the deltoid muscle of adults and children or in the anterolateral thigh muscle of neonates and infants;
the immunogenicity of the vaccine for adults is substantially lower when injections are administered
in the buttock (34). When hepatitis B vaccine is administered to infants at the same time as other
vaccines, separate sites in the anterolateral thigh may be used for the multiple injections. This method
is preferable to administering vaccine at sites such as the buttock or deltoid.
Compared with three standard doses admistered intramuscularly, three low doses of plasma-
derived or recombinant vaccine administered intradermally to adults result in lower seroconversion
rates (55%-81%) and lower final titers of anti-HBs (35-38), although four doses of plasma-derived
vaccine administered intradermally have produced responses comparable with vaccine administered
intramuscularly (39). Plasma-derived vaccine administered intradermally to infants and children does
not induce an adequate antibody response (40). At this time, low-dose intradermal vaccination of
adults should be performed only under research protocol with written informed consent. Persons who
have been vaccinated intradermally should be tested for anti-HBs. Those with an inadequate response
(anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL) should be revaccinated with three full doses of vaccine administered
intramuscularly. Intradermal vaccination should not be used for infants or children.
Vaccination during pregnancy.
On the basis of limited experience, there is no apparent risk of adverse effects to developing fetuses
when hepatitis B vaccine is administered to pregnant women (CDC, unpublished data). The vaccine
contains noninfectious HBsAg particles and should cause no risk to the fetus. HBV infection affecting
a pregnant woman may result in severe disease for the mother and chronic infection for the newborn.
Therefore, neither pregnancy nor lactation should be considered a contraindication to vaccination of
women.
Vaccine Usage
Preexposure prophylaxis
Vaccination schedule and dose. The vaccination schedule most often used for adults and children
has been three intramuscular injections, the second and third administered 1 and 6 months,
respectively, after the first. An alternate schedule of four doses has been approved for one vaccine that
4


## p. 5 (#253) ##############################################

would allow more rapid induction of immunity. However, for preexposure prophylaxis, there is no
clear evidence that this regimen provides greater protection than that obtained with the standard
three-dose schedule.
Each vaccine has been evaluated to determine the age-specific dose at which an optimum
antibody response is achieved. The recommended dose varies by product and the recipient's age and,
for infants, by the mother's HBsAg serologic status (Table 1). In general, the vaccine dose for children
and adolescents is 50%-75% lower than that required for adults (Table 1).
Incorporating hepatitis B vaccine into childhood vaccination schedules may require modifications
of previously recommended schedules. However, a protective level of anti-HBs (>10 mIU/mL) was
achieved when hepatitis B vaccine was administered in a variety of schedules, including those in which
vaccination was begun soon after birth (5,8,41 ).
In a three-dose schedule, increasing the interval between the first and second doses of hepatitis
B vaccine has little effect on immunogenicity or final antibody titer. The third dose confers optimal
protection, acting as a booster dose. Longer intervals between the last two doses (4-12 months) result
in higher final titers of anti-HBs (42,43). Several studies have shown that the currently licensed
vaccines produce high rates of seroconversion (>95%) and induce adequate levels of anti-HBs when
administered to infants at birth, 2 months, and 6 months of age or at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months
of age (CDC, Merck Sharpe & Dohme, SmithKline Beecham, unpublished data). When the vaccine is
administered in four doses at 0, 1, 2, and 12 months, the last dose is necessary to ensure the highest
final antibody titer.
When hepatitis B vaccine has been administered at the same time as other vaccines, no
interference with the antibody response of the other vaccines has been demonstrated (44).
If the vaccination series is interrupted after the first dose, the second dose should be administered
as soon as possible. The second and third doses should be separated by an interval of at least
2 months. If only the third dose is delayed, it should be administered when convenient.
The immune response when one or two doses of a vaccine produced by one manufacturer are
followed by subsequent doses from a different manufacturer has been shown to be comparable with
that resulting from a full course of vaccination with a single vaccine.
Larger vaccine doses or an increased number of doses are required to induce protective antibody
in a high proportion of hemodialysis patients (45,46 ) and may also be necessary for other immuno-
compromised persons (e.g., those who take immunosuppressive drugs or who are HIV positive),
although few data are available concerning response to higher doses of vaccine by these patients (47).
Prevaccination testing for susceptibility. Susceptibility testing is not indicated for immunization
programs for children or for most adolescents because of the low rate of HBV infection and the
relatively low cost of vaccine. For adults, the decision to do prevaccination testing should include an
analysis of cost effectiveness because of the higher cost of the vaccine. Testing for prior infection

should be considered for adults in risk groups with high rates of HBV infection (e.g., injecting drug
users, homosexual men, and household contacts of HBV carriers). The decision for testing should be
based on whether the costs of testing balance the costs of vaccine saved by not vaccinating
already-infected persons. Estimates of the cost effectiveness of testing depend on three variables: the
cost of vaccination, the cost of testing for susceptibility, and the expected prevalence of immune
persons. If susceptibility testing is being considered, careful attention should also be given to the
likelihood of patient follow-up and vaccine delivery.
For routine testing, only one antibody test is necessary (antibody either to the core antigen
(anti-HBc) or anti-HBs). Anti-HBc testing identifies all previously infected persons, including HBV
carriers, but does not differentiate carriers and non-carriers. The presence of anti-HBs identifies
previously infected persons, except for HBV carriers. Neither test has a particular advantage for groups
expected to have HBV carrier rates <2%, such as health-care workers. Anti-HBc may be preferable so
that unnecessary vaccination of HBV carriers can be avoided in groups with high carrier rates.
Postvaccination testing for serologic response. Such testing is not necessary after routine
vaccination of infants, children, or adolescents. Testing for immunity is advised only for persons
whose subsequent clinical management depends on knowledge of their immune status (e.g., infants
born to HBsAg-positive mothers, dialysis patients and staff, and persons with HIV infection).
Postvaccination testing should also be considered for persons at occupational risk who may have
exposures from injuries with sharp instruments, because knowledge of their antibody response will aid
in determining appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. When necessary, postvaccination testing
should be performed from 1 to 6 months after completion of the vaccine series. Testing after
immunoprophylaxis of infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should be performed from 3 to
9 months after the completion of the vaccination series (see section on Postexposure prophylaxis).
Revaccination of nonresponders. When persons who do not respond to the primary vaccine series
are revaccinated, 15%-25% produce an adequate antibody response after one additional dose and
30%-50% after three additional doses (48 ). Therefore, revaccination with one or more additional doses
should be considered for persons who do not respond to vaccination initially.
Postexposure prophylaxis
After a person has been exposed to HBV, appropriate immunoprophylactic treatment can effectively
prevent infection. The mainstay of postexposure immunoprophylaxis is hepatitis B vaccine, but in
some settings the addition of HBIG will provide some increase in protection. Table 2 provides a guide
to recommended treatment for various HBV exposures.
Transmission of perinatal HBV infection can be effectively prevented if the HBsAg-positive mother
is identified and if her infant receives appropriate immunoprophylaxis. Hepatitis B vaccination and one
dose of HBIG, administered within 24 hours after birth, are 85%-95% effective in preventing both HBV
infection and the chronic carrier state (4,5,8). Hepatitis B vaccine administered alone in either a

three-dose or four-dose schedule (Table 1), beginning within 24 hours after birth, is 70%-95% effective
in preventing perinatal HBV infections (8,41 ). The infants of women admitted for delivery who have
not had prenatal HBsAg testing pose problems in clinical management. Initiating hepatitis B
vaccination at birth for infants born to these women will provide adequate postexposure prophylaxis
if the mothers are indeed HBsAg positive. The few infections not prevented by either of these treatment
regimens were most likely acquired in utero or may be due to very high levels of maternal HBV-DNA
(49).
Serologic testing of infants who receive immunoprophylaxis to prevent perinatal infection should be
considered as an aid in the long-term medical management of the few infants who become HBV
carriers. Testing for anti-HBs and HBsAg at 9-15 months of age will determine the success of the
therapy and, in the case of failure, will identify HBV carriers or infants who may require revaccination.
Recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis in circumstances other than the perinatal period
(Table 2) have been addressed in a previous statement and are reprinted as Appendix A to this
document.
Vaccine Efficacy and Booster Doses
Clinical trials of the hepatitis B vaccines licensed in the United States have shown that they are
80%-95% effective in preventing HBV infection and clinical hepatitis among susceptible children and
adults (5,33,41,50 ). If a protective antibody response develops after vaccination, vaccine recipients are
virtually 100% protected against clinical illness.
The duration of vaccine-induced immunity has been evaluated in long-term follow-up studies of
both adults and children (48,51 ). Only the plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine has been evaluated
because it has had the longest clinical use; however, on the basis of comparable immunogenicity and
short-term efficacy, similar results would be expected with recombinant vaccines. The magnitude of
the antibody response induced by the primary vaccination series is predictive of antibody persistence,
and a logarithmic decline of antibody levels occurs over time. Among young adults (homosexual men
and Alaskan Eskimos) who initially responded to a three-dose vaccine series, loss of detectable
antibody has ranged from 13% to 60% after 9 years of follow-up. For children vaccinated after the first
year of life, the rate of antibody decline has been lower than for adults (51 ). The peak antibody titers
for infants are lower than those for children immunized after 12 months of age, but the rate of antibody
decline is comparable with that observed for adults in the same population.
Long-term studies of healthy adults and children indicate that immunologic memory remains intact
for at least 9 years and confers protection against chronic HBV infection, even though anti-HBs levels
may become low or decline below detectable levels (48,51,52). In these studies, the HBV infections
were detected by the presence of anti-HBc. No episodes of clinical hepatitis were reported and HBsAg
was not detected, although brief episodes of viremia may not have been detected because of
infrequent testing. The mild, inapparent infections among persons who have been previously
vaccinated should not produce the sequelae associated with chronic HBV infection and should provide
lasting immunity. In general, follow-up studies of children vaccinated at birth to prevent perinatal HBV
infection have shown that a continued high level of protection from chronic HBV infections persists at
least 5 years (52,53 ).
For chifren and adults whose immune status is normal, booster doses of vaccine are not
recommended, nor is serologic testing to assess antibody levels necessary. The possible need for
booster doses will be assessed as additional information becomes available. For hemodialysis
patients, vaccine-induced protection may be less complete and may persist only as long as antibody
levels are >10 mIU/mL. For these patients, the need for booster doses should be assessed by annual
antibody testing, and a booster dose should be administered when antibody levels decline to <10
mIU/mL.
Vaccine Side Effects and Adverse Reactions
Hepatitis B vaccines have been shown to be safe when administered to both adults and children.
Over 4 million adults have been vaccinated in the United States, and at least that many children have
received hepatitis B vaccine worldwide.
Vaccine-associated side effects
Pain at the injection site (3%-29%) and a temperature greater than 37.7 C (1%-6%) have been among
the most frequently reported side effects among adults and children receiving vaccine (5,31-33,50 ). In
placebo-controlled studies, these side effects were reported no more frequently among vaccinees than
7


## p. 8 (#256) ##############################################

among persons receiving a placebo (33,50 ). Among children receiving both hepatitis B vaccine and
DTP vaccine, these mild side effects have been observed no more frequently than among children
receiving DTP vaccine alone.
Serious adverse events
In the United States, surveillance of adverse reactions has shown a possible association between
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and receipt of the first dose of plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine (54,
CDC unpublished data). GBS was reported at a very low rate (0.5/100,000 vaccinees), no deaths were
reported, and all reported cases were among adults. An estimated 2.5 million adults received one or
more doses of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine during the period 1986-1990. Available data from
reporting systems for adverse events do not indicate an association between receipt of recombinant
vaccine and GBS (CDC, unpublished data).
Until recently, large-scale hepatitis B vaccination programs for infants (e.g., Taiwan, Alaska, and
New Zealand) have primarily used plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine. No association has been found
between vaccination and the occurrence of severe adverse events, including seizures and GBS (55, B.
McMahon and A. Milne, unpublished data). However, systematic surveillance for adverse reactions has
been limited in these populations, and only a small number of children have received recombinant
vaccine. Any presumed risk of adverse events possibly associated with hepatitis B vaccination must be
balanced against the expected risk of acute and chronic liver disease associated with the current 5%
lifetime risk of HBV infection in the United States. It is estimated that, for each U.S. birth cohort,
2,000-5,000 persons will die from HBV-related liver disease.
As hepatitis B vaccine is introduced for routine vaccination of infants, surveillance for vaccine-
associated adverse events will continue to be an important part of the program in spite of the current
record of safety. Any adverse event suspected to be associated with hepatitis B vaccination should be
reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). VAERS forms can be obtained by
calling 1-800-822-7967.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Prevention of Perinatal Hepatitis B Virus Infection
1. All pregnant women should be routinely tested for HBsAg during an early prenatal visit in each
pregnancy, preferably at the same time other routine prenatal laboratory testing is done. HBsAg
testing should be repeated late in the pregnancy for women who are HBsAg negative but who are
at high risk of HBV infection (e.g., injecting drug users, those with intercurrent sexually transmitted
diseases) or who have had clinically apparent hepatitis. Tests for other HBV markers are not
necessary for the purpose of maternal screening. However, HBsAg-positive women identified
during screening may have HBV-related liver disease and should be evaluated (56 ).
2. Infants born to mothers who are HBsAg positive should receive the appropriate doses of hepatitis
B vaccine (Table 1) and HBIG (0.5 mL) within 12 hours of birth. Both should be administered by
intramuscular injection. Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered concurrently with HBIG but at
a different site. Subsequent doses of vaccine should be administered according to the recom-
mended schedule (Table 3).
3. Women admitted for delivery who have not had prenatal HBsAg testing should have blood drawn
for testing. While test results are pending, the infant should receive hepatitis B vaccine within
12 hours of birth, in a dose appropriate for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (Table 1).
a. If the mother is later found to be HBsAg positive, her infant should receive the additional
protection of HBIG as soon as possible and within 7 days of birth, although the efficacy of HBIG
administered after 48 hours of age is not known (57). If HBIG has not been administered, it is
important that the infant receive the second dose of hepatitis B vaccine at 1 month and not later
than 2 months of age because of the high risk of infection. The last dose should be administered
at age 6 months (Table 3).*
*If a four-dose schedule is used (Tables 1 and 3), the second and third doses should be administered at 1 and
2 months of age, respectively, and the fourth dose at 12-18 months of age.
8


## p. 9 (#257) ##############################################

b. If the mother is found to be HBsAg negative, her infant should continue to receive hepatitis B
vaccine as part of his or her routine vaccinations (Tables 3 and 4), in the dose appropriate for
infants born to HBsAg-negative mothers (Table 1).
4. In populations in which screening pregnant women for HBsAg is not feasible, all infants should
receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth, their second dose at 1-
2 months of age, and their third dose at 6 months of age as a part of their childhood vaccinations
and well-child care (Table 3).
5. Household contacts and sex partners of HBsAg-positive women identified through prenatal
screening should be vaccinated. The decision to do prevaccination testing of these contacts to
determine susceptibility to HBV infection should be made according to the guidelines in the section
"Prevaccination testing for susceptibility." Hepatitis B vaccine should be administered at the
age-appropriate dose (Table 1) to those determined to be susceptible or judged likely to be
susceptible to infection.
Universal Vaccination of Infants Born to HBsAg-Negative Mothers
1. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants, regardless of the HBsAg status of the
mother. Hepatitis B vaccine should be incorporated into vaccination schedules for children. The first
dose can be administered during the newborn period, preferably before the infant is discharged

from the hospital, but no later than when the infant is 2 months of age (Table 4). Because the highest
titers of anti-HBs are achieved when the last two doses of vaccine are spaced at least 4 months apart,
schedules that achieve this spacing may be preferable (Table 4). However, schedules with 2-month
intervals between doses, which conform to schedules for other childhood vaccines, have been
shown to produce a good antibody response (Table 4) and may be appropriate in populations in
which it is difficult to ensure that infants will be brought back for all their vaccinations. The
development of combination vaccines containing HBsAg may lead to other schedules that will allow
optimal use of combined antigens.
2. Special efforts should be made to ensure that high levels of hepatitis B vaccination are achieved in
populations in which HBV infection occurs at high rates among children (Alaskan Natives, Pacific
Islanders, and infants of immigrants from countries in which HBV is endemic).
Vaccination of Adolescents
All adolescents at high risk of infection because they are injecting drug users or have multiple sex
partners (more than one partier/6 months) should receive hepatitis B vaccine. Widespread use of
hepatitis B vaccine is encouraged. Because risk factors are often not identified directly among
adolescents, universal hepatitis B vaccination of teenagers should be implemented in communities
where injecting drug use, pregnancy among teenagers, and/or sexually transmitted diseases are
common. Adolescents can be vaccinated in school-based clinics, community health centers, family
planning clinics, clinics for the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and special adolescent
clinics.
The 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule is preferred for vaccinating adolescents with the age-appropriate
dose of vaccine (Table 1). However, the choice of vaccination schedule should take into account the
feasibility of delivering three doses of vaccine over a given period of time. The use of alternate
schedules (e.g., 0, 2, and 4 months) may be advisable to achieve complete vaccination.
Vaccination of Selected High-Risk Groups
Efforts to vaccinate persons at high risk of HBV infection should follow the vaccine doses shown in
Table 1. High-risk groups for whom vaccination is recommended include:
1. Persons with occupational risk. HBV infection is an occupational hazard for health-care workers
and for public-safety workers who have exposure to blood in the workplace (24,58 ). The risk of
acquiring HBV infections from occupational exposures depends on the frequency of percutane-
ous and permucosal exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids. Any health-care or
public-safety worker may be at risk for HBV exposure, depending on the tasks he or she
performs. Workers who perform tasks involving contact with blood or blood-contaminated body
fluid should be vaccinated (24,58,59). For public-safety workers whose exposure to blood is
infrequent, timely postexposure prophylaxis should be considered rather than routine preex-
posure vaccination.
For persons in health-care fields, vaccination should be completed during training in schools
of medicine, dentistry, nursing, laboratory technology, and other allied health professions,
before trainees have their first contact with blood.
2. Clients and staff of institutions for the developmentally disabled. Susceptible clients in
institutions for the developmentally disabled, as well as staff who work closely with clients,
should be vaccinated. Susceptible clients and staff who live or work in smaller residential
settings with known HBV carriers should also receive hepatitis B vaccine. Clients discharged
from residential institutions into community programs should be screened for HBsAg so that
appropriate measures can be taken to prevent HBV transmission. These measures should
include both environmental controls and appropriate use of vaccine.
Staff of nonresidential day-care programs for the developmentally disabled (e.g., schools,
sheltered workshops) attended by known HBV carriers have a risk of infection comparable with
that of health-care workers and therefore should be vaccinated (60). The risk of infection for
other clients appears to be lower than the risk for staff. Vaccination of clients in day care
programs may be considered. Vaccination of classroom contacts is strongly encouraged if a
classmate who is an HBV carrier behaves aggressively or has special medical problems (e.g.,
exudative dermatitis, open skin lesions) that increase the risk of exposure to his or her blood or
serous secretions.
10


## p. 11 (#259) #############################################

3. Hemodialysis patients. Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for susceptible hemodialysis
patients. Vaccinating patients early in the course of their renal disease is encouraged because
patients with uremia who are vaccinated before they require dialysis are more likely to respond
to the vaccine (61 ). Although their seroconversion rates and anti-HBs titers are lower than those
of healthy persons, patients who respond to vaccination will be protected from infection, and the
need for frequent serologic testing will be reduced (62 ).
4. Recipients of certain blood products. Patients who receive clotting-factor concentrates have an
increased risk of HBV infection and should be vaccinated as soon as their specific clotting
disorder is identified. Prevaccination testing is recommended for patients who have already
received multiple infusions of these products.
5. Household contacts and sex partners of HBV carriers. All household and sexual contacts of
persons identified as HBsAg positive should be vaccinated. The decision to do prevaccination
testing to determine susceptibility to HBV infection should be made according to the guidelines
described earlier in the section "Prevaccination testing for susceptibility." Hepatitis B vaccine
should be administered at the age-appropriate dose (Table 1) to those determined to be
susceptible or judged likely to be susceptible to infection.
6. Adoptees from countries where HBV infection is endemic. Adopted or fostered orphans or
unaccompanied minors from countries where HBV infection is endemic should be screened for
HBsAg (3). If the children are HBsAg positive, other family members should be vaccinated (63).
7. International travelers. Vaccination should be considered for persons who plan to spend more
than 6 months in areas with high rates of HBV infection and who will have close contact with the
local population. Short-term travelers who are likely to have contact with blood (e.g., in a
medical setting) or sexual contact with residents of areas with high or intermediate levels of
endemic disease should be vaccinated. Vaccination should begin at least 6 months before travel
to allow for completion of the full vaccine series, although a partial series will offer some
protection. The alternate four-dose schedule (see Table 1) should provide protection if the first
three doses can be delivered before departure.
8. Injecting drug users. All injecting drug users who are susceptible to HBV should be vaccinated
as soon as their drug use begins. Because of the high rate of HBV infection in this population,
prevaccination screening should be considered as outlined in the section "Prevaccination
testing for susceptibility." Injecting drug users known to have HIV infection should be tested for
anti-HBs response after completion of the vaccine series. Those who do not respond to
vaccination should be counseled accordingly.
9. Sexually active homosexual and bisexual men. Susceptible sexually active homosexual and
bisexual men should be vaccinated. Because of the high rate of HBV infection in this population,
prevaccination screening should be considered as described in the section "Prevaccination
testing for susceptibility." Men known to have HIV infection should be tested for anti-HBs
response after completion of the vaccine series. Those who do not respond to vaccination
should be counseled accordingly.
10. Sexually active heterosexual men and women. Vaccination is recommended for men and
women who are diagnosed as having recently acquired other sexually transmitted diseases, for
prostitutes, and for persons who have a history of sexual activity with more than one partner in
the previous 6 months (2). Most patients seen in clinics for sexually transmitted diseases should
be considered candidates for vaccination.
11. Inmates of long-term correctional facilities. Prison officials should consider undertaking
screening and vaccination programs directed at inmates with histories of high-risk behaviors.
EVOLVING ISSUES IN HEPATITIS B IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS
Hepatitis B vaccine has now been used extensively throughout the world and is currently being
incorporated into the Expanded Programme on Immunization of the World Health Organization (16).
New information, vaccines, and technology will have implications for this effort, and adjustments and
changes are expected to occur over the years. Some of the issues that can be expected to be addressed
in clinical and operational studies include the following:
1. In most developing countries with hepatitis B immunization programs, the first dose of vaccine
is administered to all infants soon after birth to prevent perinatal infections; pregnant women are
11


## p. 12 (#260) #############################################

not screened for HBsAg; and HBIG is not used (8,16,45 ). The feasibility and effectiveness of
incorporating this approach into the hepatitis B prevention strategy for the United States must be
evaluated.
2. Booster doses of hepatitis B vaccine have not been recommended because of the persistence of
protective efficacy 9 years after vaccination (48,51 ). The duration of protective efficacy for
adolescents who were vaccinated during infancy or childhood must be evaluated; the results will
determine future recommendations concerning booster doses.
3. Flexible dosage schedules are required to effectively integrate hepatitis B vaccine into current and
future immunization programs for infants. Schedules may change as optimum dosage and timing
are studied and new information becomes available.
4. Multiple-antigen vaccines that incorporate HBsAg as one component are currently being
evaluated. The routine use of these vaccines may alter childhood vaccination schedules or may
result in the administration of additional doses of certain antigens. However, these vaccines
should greatly facilitate vaccine delivery and minimize the number of injections.

APPENDIX A
Postexposure Prophylaxis for Hepatitis B
Adapted from: CDC. Protection against viral hepatitis: recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP). MMWR 1990;39(No.RR-2):17-22.
INTRODUCTION
Prophylactic treatment to prevent infection after exposure to HBV should be considered in the
following situations: perinatal exposure of an infant born to an HBsAg-positive mother, inadvertent
percutaneous or permucosal exposure to HBsAg-positive blood, sexual exposure to an HBsAg-positive
person, and household exposure of an infant <12 months of age to a primary care-giver who has acute
hepatitis B.
Various studies have established the relative efficacies of HBIG and/or hepatitis B vaccine in different
exposure situations. For an infant with perinatal exposure to an HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-positive
mother, a regimen combining one dose of HBIG at birth with the hepatitis B vaccine series started soon
after birth is 85%-95% effective in preventing development of the HBV carrier state (A1-A3). Regimens
involving either multiple doses of HBIG alone or the vaccine series alone have 70%-90% efficacy
(A4,A5).
For inadvertent perrcutaneous exposure, only regimens including HBIG and/or immune globulin (IG)
have been studied. A regimen of two doses of HBIG, one given after exposure and one a month later,
is about 75% effective in preventing hepatitis B in this setting (A6,A7). For sexual exposure to a person
with acute hepatitis B, a single dose of HBIG is 75% effective if administered within 2 weeks of last
sexual exposure (A8). The efficacy of IG for postexposure prophylaxis is uncertain; IG no longer has
a role in postexposure prophylaxis of hepatitis B because of the availability of HBIG and the wider use
of hepatitis B vaccine.
Recommendations on postexposure prophylaxis are based on available efficacy data and on the
likelihood of future HBV exposure for the person requiring treatment. In all exposures, a regimen
combining HBIG with hepatitis B vaccine will provide both short- and long-term protection, will be less
costly than the two-dose HBIG treatment alone, and is the treatment of choice.
Acute Exposure to Blood that contains (or Might Contain) HBsAg
For inadvertent percutaneous (needlestick, laceration, or bite) or permucosal (ocular or mucous-
membrane) exposure to blood, the decision to provide prophylaxis must include consideration of
several factors: a) whether the source of the blood is available; b) the HBsAg status of the source; and
c) the hepatitis B vaccination and vaccine-response status of the exposed person. Such exposures
usually affect persons for whom hepatitis B vaccine is recommended. For any exposure of a person not
previously vaccinated, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended.
After any such exposure, a blood sample should be obtained from the person who was the source
of the exposure and should be tested for HBsAg. The hepatitis B vaccination status and anti-HBs
response status (if known) of the exposed person should be reviewed. The outline below and Table A1
summarize prophylaxis for percutaneous or permucosal exposure to blood according to the HBsAg
status of the source of exposure and the vaccination status and vaccine response of the exposed
person. For greatest effectiveness, passive prophylaxis with HBIG, when indicated, should be
administered as soon as possible after exposure since its value beyond 7 days after exposure is
unclear.
1. Source of exposure known and HBsAg positive
a. Exposed person has not been vaccinated or has not completed vaccination. Hepatitis B
vaccination should be initiated. A single dose of HBIG (0.06 mL/kg) should be administered as
soon as possible after exposure and within 24 hours, if possible. The first dose of hepatitis B
vaccine should be administered intramuscularly at a separate site (deltoid for adults) and can be
administered simultaneously with HBIG or within 7 days of exposure; subsequent doses should
be administered as recommended for the specific vaccine. If the exposed person has begun but
has not completed vaccination, one dose of HBIG should be administered immediately and
vaccination should be completed as scheduled.
15


## p. 16 (#264) #############################################

b. Exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, and anti-HBs response status is
known.
(1) If the exposed person is known to have had adequate response in the past, the anti-HBs level
should be tested unless an adequate level has been demonstrated within the last 24 months.
Although current data show that vaccine-induced protection does not decrease as antibody
level wanes, most experts consider the following approach to be prudent:
(a) If the anti-HBs level is adequate, no treatment is necessary.
(b) If the anti-HBs level is inadequate,* a booster dose of hepatitis B vaccine should be
administered.
(2) If the exposed person is known not to have responded to the primary vaccine series, he or she
should receive either a single dose of HBIG and a dose of hepatitis B vaccine as soon as
possible after exposure, or two doses of HBIG (0.06 mL/kg), one as soon as possible after
exposure and the second 1 month later. The latter treatment is preferred for those who have
not responded to at least four doses of vaccine.
c. Exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, and the anti-HBs response is
unknown. The exposed person should be tested for anti-HBs.
(1) If the exposed person has adequate antibody, no additional treatment is necessary.
(2) If the exposed person has inadequate antibody on testing, one dose of HBIG (0.06 mL/kg)
should be administered immediately and a standard booster dose of vaccine administered at
a different site.
2. Source of exposure known and HBsAg-negative
a. Exposed person has not been vaccinated or has not completed vaccination. If unvaccinated, the
exposed person should be administered the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 7 days of
exposure, and vaccination should be completed as recommended. If the exposed person has not
completed vaccination, vaccination series should be completed as scheduled.
b. Exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B. No treatment is necessary.
3. Source of exposure unknown or not available for testing.
a. Exposed person has not been vaccinated or has not completed vaccination. If unvaccinated, the
exposed person should be administered the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 7 days of
An adequate antibody level is >10 mIU/mL.

exposure and vaccination should be completed as recommended. If the exposed person has not
completed vaccination, vaccination should be completed as scheduled.
b. Exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, and anti-HBs response status is
known.
(1) If the exposed person is known to have had adequate response in the past, no treatment is
necessary.
(2) If the exposed person is known not to have responded to the vaccine, prophylaxis as
described earlier in section 1.b.(2) under "Source of exposure known and HBsAg-positive"
may be considered if the source of the exposure is known to be at high risk of HBV infection.
c. Exposed person has already been vaccinated against hepatitis B, and the anti-HBs response is
unknown. The exposed person should be tested for anti-HBs.
(1) If the exposed person has adequate anti-HBs, no treatment is necessary.
(2) If the exposed person has inadequate anti-HBs, a standard booster dose of vaccine should be
administered.
Sex Partners of Persons with Acute Hepatitis B Virus Infection
Sex partners of HBsAg-positive persons are at increased risk of acquiring HBV infection, and HBIG
has been shown to be 75% effective in preventing such infections (A8). Because data are limited, the
period after sexual exposure during which HBIG is effective is unknown, but extrapolation from other
settings makes it unlikely that this period would exceed 14 days. Before treatment, testing sex partners
for susceptibility is recommended if it does not delay treatment beyond 14 days after last exposure.
Testing for anti-HBc is the most efficient prescreening procedure to use in this population.
All susceptible persons whose sex partners have acute hepatitis B infection should receive a single
dose of HBIG (0.06 mL/kg) and should begin the hepatitis B vaccine series if prophylaxis can be started
within 14 days of the last sexual contact or if sexual contact with the infected person will continue.
Administering the vaccine with HBIG may improve the efficacy of postexposure treatment. The vaccine
has the added advantage of conferring long-lasting protection.
An alternate treatment for persons who are not from a high-risk group for whom vaccine is routinely
recommended and whose regular sex partners have acute HBV infection is to administer one dose of
HBIG (without vaccine) and retest the sex partner for HBsAg 3 months later. No further treatment is
necessary if the sex partner becomes HBsAg negative. If the sex partner remains HBsAg positive, a
second dose of HBIG should be given and the hepatitis B vaccine series started.
Household Contacts of Persons with Acute Hepatitis B Virus Infection
Since infants have close contact with primary care-givers and they have a higher risk of becoming
HBV carriers after acute HBV infection, prophylaxis of an infant less than 12 months of age with HBIG
(0.5 mL) and hepatitis B vaccine is indicated if the mother or primary care-giver has acute HBV
infection. Prophylaxis for other household contacts of persons with acute HBV infection is not indicated
unless they have had identifiable blood exposure to the index patient, such as by sharing toothbrushes
or razors. Such exposures should be treated like sexual exposures. If the index patient becomes an
HBV carrier, all household contacts should receive hepatitis B vaccine.

Prevention and Control of Influenza
Recommendations of the Immunization Practices
Advisory Committee (ACIP)
These recommendations update information on the vaccine and antiviral agents available for
controlling influenza during the 1992–1993 influenza season (superseding the MMWR 1991;
40(no. RR-6):1–15.) The primary changes include statements about vaccination of persons with
known hypersensitivity to eggs or other components of the influenza vaccine, the optimal
timing of influenza vaccination, and the influenza strains in the trivalent vaccine for 1992–1993.
INTRODUCTION
Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes on the basis of two surface antigens: hemagglutinin
(H) and neuraminidase (N). Three subtypes of hemagglutinin (H1, H2, H3) and two subtypes of
neuraminidase (N1, N2) are recognized among influenza A viruses that have caused widespread
human disease. Immunity to these antigens - especially to the hemagglutinin - reduces the likelihood
of infection and lessens the severity of disease if infection occurs. Infection with a virus of one subtype
confers little or no protection against viruses of other subtypes. Furthermore, over time, antigenic
variation (antigenic drift) within a subtype may be so marked that infection or vaccination with one
strain may not induce immunity to distantly related strains of the same subtype. Although influenza B
viruses have shown more antigenic stability than influenza A viruses, antigenic variation does occur.
For these reasons, major epidemics of respiratory disease caused by new variants of influenza
continue to occur. The antigenic characteristics of strains currently circulating provide the basis for
selecting virus strains to include in each year's vaccine.
Typical influenza illness is characterized by abrupt onset of fever, myalgia, sore throat, and
nonproductive cough. Unlike other common respiratory infections, influenza can cause severe malaise
lasting several days. More severe illness can result if primary influenza pneumonia or secondary
bacterial pneumonia occur. During influenza epidemics, high attack rates of acute illness result in
increased numbers of visits to physicians' offices, walk-in clinics, and emergency rooms and increased
hospitalizations for management of lower-respiratory-tract complications.
Elderly persons and persons with underlying health problems are at increased risk for complications
of influenza infection. If infected, such high-risk persons or groups (listed as "groups at increased risk
for influenza-related complications" under Target Groups for Special Vaccination Programs) are more
likely than the general population to require hospitalization. During major epidemics, hospitalization
rates for high-risk persons may increase 2- to 5-fold, depending on the age group. Previously healthy
children and younger adults may also require hospitalization for influenza-related complications, but
the relative increase in their hospitalization rates is less than for persons who belong to high-risk
groups.
An increase in mortality further indicates the impact of influenza epidemics. Increased mortality
results not only from influenza and pneumonia but also from cardiopulmonary and other chronic
diseases that can be exacerbated by influenza infection. It is estimated that more than 10,000 excess
deaths occurred during each of seven different U.S. epidemics in the period 1977–1988, and more than
40,000 excess deaths occurred during each of two of these epidemics. Approximately 80%-90% of the
deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza occurred among persons 65 years of age.
Because the proportion of elderly persons in the U.S. population is increasing and because age and
its associated chronic diseases are risk factors for severe influenza illness, the toll from influenza can
be expected to increase unless control measures are administered more vigorously. The number of
younger persons at increased risk for influenza-related complications is also increasing for various
reasons, such as the success of neonatal intensive care units, better management of diseases such as
cystic fibrosis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and better survival rates for
organ-transplant recipients.

OPTIONS FOR THE CONTROL OF INFLUENZA
In the United States two measures are available that can reduce the impact of influenza;
immunoprophylaxis with inactivated (killed-virus) vaccine and chemoprophylaxis or therapy with an
influenza-specific antiviral drug (e.g., amantadine). Vaccination of high-risk persons each year before
the influenza season is currently the most effective measure for reducing the impact of influenza.
Vaccination can be highly cost-effective when a) it is directed at persons who are most likely to
experience complications or who are at increased risk for exposure, and b) it is administered to
high-risk persons during hospitalization or a routine health-care visit before the influenza season, thus
making special visits to physicians' offices or clinics unnecessary. Recent reports indicate that, when
vaccine and epidemic strains of virus are well matched - achieving high vaccination rates among
closed populations can reduce the risk of outbreaks by inducing herd immunity.
Other indications for vaccination include the strong desire of any person to avoid influenza infection,
reduce the severity of disease, or reduce the chance of transmitting influenza to high-risk persons with
whom the individual has frequent contact.
The antiviral agent available for use at this time (amantadine hydrochloride) is effective only against
influenza A and, for maximum effectiveness as prophylaxis, must be administered throughout the
period of risk. When administered as either prophylaxis or therapy, the potential effectiveness of
amantadine must be balanced against potential side effects.
Chemoprophylaxis is not a substitute for vaccination. Recommendations for chemoprophylaxis are
provided primarily to help health-care providers make decisions regarding persons who are at greatest
risk of severe illness and complications if infected with an influenza A virus. Use of amantadine may
be considered a) as a control measure when influenza A outbreaks occur in institutions housing
high-risk persons, both for treatment of ill individuals and as prophylaxis for others; b) as short-term
prophylaxis after late vaccination of high-risk persons (i.e., when influenza A infections are already
occurring in the community) during the period when immunity is developing in response to
vaccination; c) as seasonal prophylaxis for persons for whom vaccination is contraindicated; d) as
seasonal prophylaxis for immunocompromised persons who may not produce protective levels of
antibody in response to vaccination; and e) as prophylaxis for unvaccinated health-care workers and
household contacts who care for high-risk persons either for the duration of influenza activity in the
community or until immunity develops after vaccination.
Amantadine is also approved for use by any person who wishes to reduce his or her chances of
becoming ill with influenza A.
INACTIVATED VACCINE FOR INFLUENZA A AND B
Influenza vaccine is made from highly purified, egg-grown viruses that have been rendered
noninfectious (inactivated). Therefore, the vaccine cannot cause influenza. Each year's influenza
vaccine contains three virus strains (usually two type A and one type B) representing influenza viruses
believed likely to circulate in the United States in the upcoming winter. The composition of the vaccine
is such that it rarely causes systemic or febrile reactions. Whole-virus, subvirion, and purified-surface-
antigen preparations are available. To minimize febrile reactions, only subvirion or purified-surface-
antigen preparations should be used for children; any of the preparations may be used for adults. Most
vaccinated children and young adults develop high postvaccination hemagglutination-inhibition
antibody titers. These antibody titers are protective against infection by strains similar to those in the
vaccine or the related variants that may emerge during outbreak periods. Elderly persons and persons
with certain chronic diseases may develop lower postvaccination antibody titers than healthy young
adults, and thus may remain susceptible to influenza upper-respiratory-tract infection. Nevertheless,
even if such persons develop influenza illness, the vaccine has been shown to be effective in
preventing lower-respiratory-tract involvement or other complications, thereby reducing the risk of
hospitalization and death.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE OF INFLUENZA VACCINE
Influenza vaccine is strongly recommended for any person 6 months of age who – because of age
or underlying medical condition-is at increased risk for complications of influenza. Health-care
2

workers and others (including household members) in close contact with high-risk persons should also
be vaccinated. In addition, influenza vaccine may be administered to any person who wishes to reduce
the chance of becoming infected with influenza. The trivalent influenza vaccine prepared for the
1992-1993 season will include A/Texas/36/91-like(H1N1), A/Beijing/353/89-like (H3N2), and B/Panama/
45/90-like hemagglutinin antigens. Recommended doses are listed in Table 1. Guidelines for the use of
vaccine among different groups follow.
Although the current influenza vaccine can contain one or more antigens administered in previous
years, annual vaccination using the current vaccine is necessary because immunity for a person
declines in the year following vaccination. Because the 1992–1993 vaccine differs from the 1991-1992
vaccine, supplies of 1991–1992 vaccine should not be administered to provide protection for the
1992-1993 influenza season.
Two doses administered at least 1 month apart may be required for a satisfactory antibody response
among previously unvaccinated children <9 years of age; however, studies with vaccines similar to
those in current use have shown little or no improvement in antibody responses when a second dose
is administered to adults during the same season.
During the past decade, data on influenza vaccine immunogenicity and side effects have been
obtained when vaccine has been administered intramuscularly. Because there has been no adequate
evaluation of recent influenza vaccines administered by other routes, the intramuscular route is
recommended for use. Adults and older children should be vaccinated in the deltoid muscle, and
infants and young children in the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.
TARGET GROUPS FOR SPECIAL VACCINATION PROGRAMS
To maximize prutection of high-risk persons, they and their close contacts should be targeted for
organized vaccination programs.
Groups at Increased Risk for Influenza-Related Complications:
1. Persons >65 years of age.
2. Residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities housing persons of any age with
chronic medical conditions.
3. Adults and children with chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems, including
children with asthma.

and side effects of split- and whole-virus vaccines are similar among adults when vaccines are administered at
the recommended dosage.
$The recommended site of vaccination is the deltoid muscle for adults and older children. The preferred site for
infants and young children is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh.
'Two doses administered at least 1 month apart are recommended for children <9 years of age who are receiving
influenza vaccine for the first time.

4. Adults and children who have required regular medical follow-up or hospitalization during the
preceding year because of chronic metabolic diseases (including diabetes mellitus), renal
dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression (including immunosuppression
caused by medications).
5. Children and teenagers (6 months–18 years of age) who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy,
and therefore may be at risk of developing Reye syndrome after influenza.
Groups That Can Transmit Influenza to High-Risk Persons:
Persons who are clinically or subclinically infected and who attend or live with high-risk persons can
transmit influenza virus to them. Some high-risk persons (e.g., the elderly, transplant recipients, or
persons with AIDS) can have low antibody responses to influenza vaccine. Efforts to protect these
high-risk persons against influenza may be improved by reducing the chances of exposure to influenza
from their care providers. Therefore, the following groups should be vaccinated:
1. Physicians, nurses, and other personnel in both hospital and outpatient-care settings who have
contact with high-risk persons among all age groups, including infants.
2. Employees of nursing homes and chronic-care facilities who have contact with patients or
residents.
3. Providers of home care to high-risk persons (e.g., visiting nurses, volunteer workers).
4. Household members (including children) of high-risk persons.
VACCINATION OF OTHER GROUPS
General Population
Physicians should administer influenza vaccine to any person who wishes to reduce the chance of
acquiring influenza infection. Persons who provide essential community services may be considered
for vaccination to minimize disruption of essential activities during influenza outbreaks. Similarly,
students or other persons in institutional settings such as those who reside in dormitories may be
considered for vaccination to minimize the disruption of routine activities during epidemics.
Pregnant Women
Influenza-associated excess mortality among pregnant women has not been documented except in
the pandemics of 1918–1919 and 1957–1958. However, pregnant women who have other medical
conditions that increase their risks for complications from influenza should be vaccinated, as the
vaccine is considered safe for pregnant women. Administering the vaccine after the first trimester is a
reasonable precaution to minimize any concern over the theoretical risk of teratogenicity. However, it
is undesirable to delay vaccination of pregnant women who have high-risk conditions and who will still
be in the first trimester of pregnancy when the influenza season begins.
Persons Infected with HIV
Little information exists regarding the frequency and severity of influenza illness among human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons, but recent reports suggest that symptoms may be
prolonged and the risk of complications increased for HIV-infected persons. Because influenza may
result in serious illness and complications, vaccination is a prudent precaution and will result in
protective antibody levels in many recipients. However, the antibody response to vaccine may be low
in persons with advanced HIV-related illnesses; a booster dose of vaccine has not improved the
immune response for these individuals.
Foreign Travelers
Increasingly, the elderly and persons with high-risk medical conditions are embarking on interna-
tional travel. The risk of exposure to influenza during foreign travel varies, depending on season and
destination. In the tropics, influenza can occur throughout the year; in the southern hemisphere, the
season of greatest activity is April-September. Because of the short incubation period for influenza,
exposure to the virus during travel can result in clinical illness that also begins while traveling, an
inconvenience or potential danger, especially for persons at increased risk for complications. Persons
preparing to travel to the tropics at any time of year or to the southern hemisphere during
April-September should review their influenza vaccination histories. If they were not vaccinated the
4


## p. 5 (#275) ##############################################

previous fall or winter, they should consider influenza vaccination before travel. Persons among the
high-risk categories should be especially encouraged to receive the most currently available vaccine.
High-risk persons administered the previous season's vaccine before travel should be revaccinated in
the fall or winter with the current vaccine.
PERSONS WHO SHOULD NOT BE VACCINATED
Inactivated influenza vaccine should not be administered to persons known to have anaphylactic
hypersensitivity to eggs or to other components of the influenza vaccine without first consulting a
physician (see Side Effects and Adverse Reactions). Amantadine hydrochloride is an option for
prevention of influenza A in such persons. However, persons who have a history of anaphylactic
hypersensitivity to vaccine components but who are also at higher risk for complications of influenza
infections may benefit from vaccine after appropriate allergy evaluation and desensitization. Specific
information about vaccine components can be found in warnings and contraindications in package
inserts for each manufacturer.
It is usually preferable to delay vaccination of adults with acute febrile illnesses until their symptoms
have abated. However, minor illnesses with or without fever should not contraindicate the use of
influenza vaccine, particularly among children with a mild upper respiratory tract infection or allergic
rhinitis (see American Academy of Pediatrics, The Red Book, 1991).
SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS
Because influenza vaccine contains only noninfectious viruses, it cannot cause influenza. Respira-
tory disease after vaccination represents coincidental illness unrelated to influenza vaccination. The
most frequent side effect of vaccination is soreness at the vaccination site that lasts for up to 2 days;
this is reported for less than one-third of vaccinees. In addition, two types of systemic reactions have
occurred:
1. Fever, malaise, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms occur infrequently and most often affect
persons who have had no exposure to the influenza virus antigens in the vaccine (e.g., young
children). These reactions begin 6–12 hours after vaccination and can persist for 1 or 2 days.
2. Immediate - presumably allergic reactions (such as hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, or
systemic anaphylaxis) occur rarely after influenza vaccination. These reactions probably result
from hypersensitivity to some vaccine component, the majority are most likely related to
residual egg protein. Although current influenza vaccines contain only a small quantity of egg
protein, this protein may induce immediate hypersensitivity reactions among persons with
severe egg allergy. Persons who have developed hives, have had swelling of the lips or tongue,
or experienced acute respiratory distress or collapse after eating eggs should consult a physician
for appropriate evaluation to assist in determining whether vaccination may proceed or should be
deferred. Persons with documented immunoglobulin E.(IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to eggs-
including those who have had occupational asthma or other allergic responses from exposure to
egg protein - may also be at increased risk for reactions from influenza vaccine, and similar
consultation should be considered. The protocol for influenza vaccination developed by Murphy
and Strunk may be considered for patients who have egg allergies and medical conditions that
place them at increased risk for influenza infection or its complications (See Murphy and Strunk,
1985).
Unlike the 1976 swine influenza vaccine, subsequent vaccines prepared from other virus strains
have not been clearly associated with an increased frequency of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Although
influenza vaccination can inhibit the clearance of warfarin and theophylline, studies have failed to
show any adverse clinical effects attributable to these drugs among patients receiving influenza
vaccine.
The potential exists for hypersensitivity reactions to any vaccine component. Although exposure to
vaccines containing thimerosal can lead to induction of hypersensitivity, most patients do not develop
reactions to thimerosal administered as a component of vaccines even when patch or intradermal tests
for thimerosal indicate hypersensitivity. When it has been reported, hypersensitivity to thimerosal has
usually consisted of local delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.

SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF OTHER VACCINES, INCLUDING
CHILDHOOD VACCINES
-
The target groups for influenza and pneumococcal vaccination overlap considerably. Both vaccines
can be administered at the same time at different sites without increasing side effects. However,
influenza vaccine must be administered each year, whereas pneumococcal vaccine is generally
administered only once to all but those at highest risk of fatal pneumococcal disease (reference ACIP
statement, MMWR 1989;38:64–8, 73–6.).
Children at high risk for influenza-related complications may receive influenza vaccine at the same
time as measles-mumps-rubella, Haemophilus b, pneumococcal, and oral polio vaccines. Vaccines
should be administered at different sites on the body. Influenza vaccine should not be administered
within 3 days of vaccination with pertussis vaccine.
TIMING OF INFLUENZA VACCINATION ACTIVITIES
Beginning each September, when vaccine for the upcoming influenza season becomes available,
high-risk persons who are seen by health-care providers for routine care or as a result of hospitalization
should be offered influenza vaccine. Opportunities to vaccinate persons at high risk for complications
of influenza should not be missed.
The optimal time for organized vaccination campaigns for high-risk persons usually is the period
between mid-October and mid-November. In the United States influenza activity generally peaks
between late December and early March, and high levels of influenza activity infrequently occur in the
contiguous 48 states before December. It is particularly important to avoid administering vaccine too
far in advance of the influenza season in facilities such as nursing homes because antibody levels may
begin to decline within a few months of vaccination. Vaccination programs can be undertaken as soon
as current vaccine is available if regional influenza activity is expected to begin earlier than December.
Children <9 years of age who have not previously been vaccinated should receive two doses of
vaccine at least a month apart to maximize the chance of a satisfactory antibody response to all three
vaccine antigens. The second dose should be administered before December, if possible. Vaccine
should be offered to both children and adults up to and even after influenza virus activity is
documented in a community, as late as April in some years.
STRATEGIES FOR IMPLEMENTING INFLUENZA VACCINE RECOMMEN-
DATIONS
Despite the recognition that optimum medical care for both adults and children includes regular
review of immunization records and administration of vaccines as appropriate, <30% of persons
among high-risk groups receive influenza vaccine each year. More effective strategies are needed for
delivering vaccine to high-risk persons, their health-care providers, and their household contacts.
In general, successful vaccination programs have combined education for health-care workers,
publicity and education targeted toward potential recipients, a plan for identifying (usually by
medical-record review) persons at high-risk, and efforts to remove administrative and financial barriers
that prevent persons from receiving the vaccine.
Persons for whom influenza vaccine is recommended can be identified and vaccinated in the
settings described below.
Outpatient Clinics and Physicians' Offices
Staff in physicians' offices, clinics, health-maintenance organizations, and employee health clinics
should be instructed to identify and label the medical records of patients who should receive vaccine.
Vaccine should be offered during visits beginning in September and throughout the influenza season.
The offer of vaccine and its receipt or refusal should be documented in the medical record. Patients
among high-risk groups who do not have regularly scheduled visits during the fall should be reminded
by mail or telephone of the need for vaccine. If possible, arrangements should be made to provide
vaccine with minimal waiting time and at the lowest possible cost.
6


## p. 7 (#277) ##############################################

Facilities Providing Episodic or Acute Care (e.g., emergency rooms, walk-in clinics)
Health-care providers in these settings should be familiar with influenza vaccine recommendations.
They should offer vaccine to persons among high-risk groups or should provide written information on
why, where, and how to obtain the vaccine. Written information should be available in language(s)
appropriate for the population served by the facility.
Nursing Homes and Other Residential Long-Term-Care Facilities
Vaccination should be routinely provided to all residents of chronic-care facilities with the
concurrence of attending physicians rather than by obtaining individual vaccination orders for each
patient. Consent for vaccination should be obtained from the resident or a family member at the time
of admission to the facility, and all residents should be vaccinated at one time, immediately preceding
the influenza season. Residents admitted during the winter months after completion of the vaccination
program should be vaccinated when they are admitted.
Acute-Care Hospitals
All persons >65 years of age and younger persons (including children) with high-risk conditions
who are hospitalized from September through March should be offered and strongly encouraged to
receive influenza vaccine before they are discharged. Household members and others with whom they
will have contact should receive written information about why and where to obtain influenza vaccine.
Outpatient Facilities Providing Continuing Care to High-Risk Patients (e.g., hemodi-
alysis centers, hospital specialty-care clinics, outpatient rehabilitation programs)
All patients should be offered vaccine in one period shortly before the beginning of the influenza
season. Patients admitted to such programs during the winter months after the earlier vaccination
program has been conducted should be vaccinated at the time of admission. Household members
should receive written information regarding the need for vaccination and the places to obtain
influenza vaccine.
Visiting Nurses and Others Providing Home Care to High-Risk Persons
Nursing-care plans should identify high-risk patients, and vaccine should be provided in the home
if necessary. Care givers and others in the household (including children) should be referred for
vaccination.
Facilities Providing Services to Persons >65 Years of Age (e.g., retirement commu-
nities, recreation centers)
All unvaccinated residents/attendees should be offered vaccine on site at one time period before the
influenza season; alternatively, education/publicity programs should emphasize the need for influenza
vaccine and should provide specific information on how, where, and when to obtain it.
Clinics and Others Providing Health Care for Travelers
Indications for influenza vaccination should be reviewed before travel and vaccine offered if
appropriate (see Foreign Travelers).
Health-Care Workers
Administrators of all health-care facilities should arrange for influenza vaccine to be offered to all
personnel before the influenza season. Personnel should be provided with appropriate educational
materials and strongly encouraged to receive vaccine, with particular emphasis on vaccination of
persons who care for high-risk persons (e.g., staff of intensive-care units, including newborn
intensive-care units; staff of medical/surgical units; and employees of nursing homes and chronic-care
facilities). Using a mobile cart to take vaccine to hospital wards or other work sites and making vaccine
available during night and weekend work shifts may enhance compliance, as may a follow-up
campaign if an outbreak occurs in the community.

ANTIVIRAL AGENTS FOR INFLUENZA A
The two antiviral agents with specific activity against influenza A viruses are amantadine hydro-
chloride and rimantadine hydrochloride. Only amantadine is licensed for use in the United States.
These chemically related drugs interfere with the replication cycle of type A (but not type B) influenza
viruses, although the specific mechanisms of their antiviral activity are not completely understood.
When administered prophylactically to healthy young adults or children in advance of and throughout
the epidemic period, amantadine is approximately 70%-90% effective in preventing illnesses caused
by naturally occurring strains of type A influenza viruses. When administered to otherwise healthy
young adults and children for symptomatic treatment within 48 hours after the onset of influenza
illness, amantadine has been shown to reduce the duration of fever and other systemic symptoms and
may permit a more rapid return to routine daily activities. Since antiviral agents taken prophylactically
may prevent illness but not subclinical infection, some persons who take these drugs may still develop
immune responses that will protect them when exposed to antigenically related viruses in later years.
As with all drugs, symptoms may occur that are side effects of amantadine among a small
proportion of persons. Such symptoms are rarely severe, but may be important for some categories of
patients.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF AMANTADINE
Outbreak Control in Institutions
When outbreaks of influenza A occur in institutions that house high-risk persons, chemoprophylaxis
should begin as early as possible to reduce the spread of the infection. Contingency planning is needed
to ensure rapid administration of amantadine to residents and employees. This should include
preapproved medication orders or plans to obtain physicians' orders on short notice. When amanta-
dine is used for outbreak control, it should be administered to all residents of the affected institution
regardless of whether they received influenza vaccine the previous fall. The dose for each resident
should be determined after consulting the dosage recommendations and precautions that follow in
this document and those listed in the manufacturer's package insert. To reduce spread of virus and to
minimize disruption of patient care, chemoprophylaxis should also be offered to unvaccinated staff
who provide care to high-risk persons. To be fully effective as prophylaxis, the antiviral drug must be
taken each day for the duration of influenza activity in the community.
Use as Prophylaxis
High-risk persons vaccinated after influenza A activity has begun
High-risk persons can still be vaccinated after an outbreak of influenza A has begun in a community.
However, the development of antibodies in adults after vaccination usually takes 2 weeks, during
which time amantadine should be administered. Children who receive influenza vaccine for the first
time may require up to 6 weeks of prophylaxis, or until 2 weeks after the second dose of vaccine has
been received. Amantadine does not interfere with the antibody response to the vaccine.
Persons providing care to high-risk persons
To reduce the spread of virus and to maintain care for high-risk persons in the home, hospital, or
institutional setting, chemoprophylaxis should be considered for unvaccinated persons who have
frequent contact with high-risk persons in the home setting (e.g., household members, visiting nurses,
volunteer workers) and unvaccinated employees of hospitals, clinics, and chronic-care facilities. For
employees who cannot be vaccinated, chemoprophylaxis should be continued for the entire period
influenza A virus is circulating in the community; for those who are vaccinated at a time when influenza
A is present in the community, chemoprophylaxis should be administered for 2 weeks after
vaccination. Prophylaxis should be considered for all employees, regardless of their vaccination status,
if the outbreak is caused by a variant strain of influenza A that is not covered by the vaccine.
Immunodeficient persons
Chemoprophylaxis may be indicated for high-risk persons who are expected to have a poor antibody
response to influenza vaccine. This includes many persons with HIV infection, especially those with
advanced disease. No data are available on possible interactions with other drugs used in the
management of patients with HIV infection. Such patients must be monitored closely if amantadine is
administered.
8


## p. 9 (#279) ##############################################

Persons for whom influenza vaccine is contraindicated
Chemoprophylaxis throughout the influenza season may be appropriate for high-risk persons for
whom influenza vaccine is contraindicated because of anaphylactic hypersensitivity to egg protein or
other vaccine components.
Other persons
Amantadine can also be administered prophylactically by anyone who wishes to avoid influenza A
illness. This decision should be made by the physician and patient on an individual basis.
Use as Therapy
Amantadine can reduce the severity and shorten the duration of influenza A illness among healthy
adults. However, there are no data on the efficacy of amantadine therapy in preventing complications
of influenza A among high-risk persons. Therefore, no specific recommendations can be made
regarding the therapeutic use of amantadine for these patients. This does not preclude physicians'
using amantadine for high-risk patients who develop illness compatible with influenza during a period
of known or suspected influenza A activity in the community. Whether amantadine is effective when
treatment begins beyond the first 48 hours of illness is not known.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE SELECTION OF AMANTADINE FOR
PROPHYLAXIS OR TREATMENT
Side Effects/Toxicity
When amantadine is administered to healthy young adults at a dose of 200 mg/day, minor
central-nervous-system (CNS) side effects (nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, difficulty concentrating,
and lightheadedness) or gastrointestinal side effects (anorexia and nausea) occur among approxi-
mately 5%-10% of patients. Side effects diminish or cease soon after discontinuing use of the drug.
With prolonged use, side effects may also diminish or disappear after the first week of use. More
serious but less frequent CNS-related side effects (seizures, confusion) associated with use of
amantadine have usually affected only elderly persons, those with renal disease, and those with
seizure disorders or other altered mental or behavioral conditions. Reducing the dosage to <100
mg/day appears to reduce the frequency of these side effects among such persons without compro-
mising the prophylactic effectiveness of amantadine.
The package insert should be reviewed before use of amantadine for any patient. The patient's age,
weight, renal function, presence of other medical conditions, and indications for use of amantadine
(prophylaxis or therapy) must be considered, and the dosage and duration of treatment adjusted
appropriately. Modifications in dosage may be required for persons with impaired renal function, the
elderly, children, persons who have neuropsychiatric disorders or who take psychotropic drugs, and
persons with a history of seizures.
Development of Drug-Resistant Viruses
Amantadine-resistant influenza viruses can emerge when amantadine is administered for treatment.
The frequency with which resistant isolates emerge and the extent of their transmission are unknown,
but there is no evidence that amantadine-resistant viruses are more virulent or more transmissible
than amantadine-sensitive viruses. Thus the use of amantadine remains an appropriate outbreak-
control measure. In closed populations such as nursing homes, persons with influenza who are treated
with amantadine should be separated, if possible, from asymptomatic persons who are administered
amantadine as prophylaxis. Because of possible induction of amantadine resistance, it is advisable to
discontinue amantadine treatment of persons who have influenza-like illness as soon as clinically
warranted, generally within 3-5 days. Isolation of influenza viruses from persons who are receiving
amantadine should be reported through state health departments to CDC and the isolates saved for
antiviral sensitivity testing.

Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
These recommendations update the last statement by the Immunization Practices Advisory
Committee (ACIP) on pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MMWR 1984;33:273–6, 281) and include
new information regarding 1) vaccine efficacy, 2) use in persons with human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection and in other groups at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, and 3) guidelines for
revaccination.
INTRODUCTION
Disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remains an important cause of
morbidity and mortality in the United States, particularly in the very young, the elderly, and persons
with certain high-risk conditions. Pneumococcal pneumonia accounts for 10%-25% of all pneumonias
and an estimated 40,000 deaths annually (1). Although no recent data from the United States exist, in
the United Kingdom pneumococcal infections may account for 34% of pneumonias in adults who
require hospitalization (2). The best estimates of the incidence of serious pneumococcal disease in the
United States are based on surveys and community-based studies of pneumococcal bacteremia.
Recent studies suggest annual rates of bacteremia of 15–19/100,000 for all persons, 50/100,000 for
persons >65 years old, and 160/100,000 for children <2 years old (3,4). These rates are 2–3 times those
previously documented in the United States. The overall rate for pneumococcal bacteremia in some
Native American populations can be six times the rate of the general population (5). The incidence of
pneumococcal pneumonia can be 3–5 times that of the detected rates of bacteremia. The estimated
incidence of pneumococcal meningitis is 1-2/100,000 persons.
Mortality from pneumococcal disease is highest in patients with bacteremia or meningitis, patients
with underlying medical conditions, and older persons. In some high-risk patients, mortality has been
reported to be >40% for bacteremic disease and 55% for meningitis, despite appropriate antimicrobial
therapy. Over 90% of pneumococci remain very sensitive to penicillin.
In addition to the very young and persons >65 years old, patients with certain chronic conditions are
at increased risk of developing pneumococcal infection and severe pneumococcal illness. Patients with
chronic cardiovascular diseases, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and
cirrhosis are generally immunocompetent but have increased risk. Other patients at greater risk
because of decreased responsiveness to polysaccharide antigens or more rapid decline in serum
antibody include those with functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease or splenectomy),
Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, and
organ transplantation. In a recent population-based study, all persons 55–64 years old with pneumo-
coccal bacteremia had at least one of these chronic conditions (4). Studies indicate that patients with
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are also at increased risk of pneumococcal disease, with
an annual attack rate of pneumococcal pneumonia as high as 17.9/1000 (6–8). This observation is
consistent with the B-cell dysfunction noted in patients with AIDS (9,10). Recurrent pneumococcal
meningitis may occur in patients with cerebrospinal fluid leakage complicating skull fractures or
neurologic procedures.
PNEUMOCOCCAL POLYSACCHARIDE VACCINE
The current pneumococcal vaccine (Pneumovax® 23, Merck Sharp & Dohme, and Pnu-Imune® 23,
Lederle Laboratories) is composed of purified capsular polysaccharide antigens of 23 types of S.
pneumoniae (Danish types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 177, 18C, 19F, 19A,
20, 22F, 23F, 33F). It was licensed in the United States in 1983, replacing a 14-valent vaccine licensed
in 1977. Each vaccine dose (0.5 mL) contains 25 ug of each polysaccharide antigen. The 23 capsular
1

types in the vaccine cause 88% of the bacteremic pneumococcal disease in the United States. In
addition, studies of the human antibody response indicate that cross-reactivity occurs for several types
(e.g., 6A and 6B) that cause an additional 8% of bacteremic disease (11).
Most healthy adults, including the elderly, show a twofold or greater rise in type-specific antibody,
as measured by radioimmunoassay, within 2–3 weeks of vaccination. Similar antibody responses have
been reported in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus requiring insulin. In immuno-
compromised patients, the response to vaccination may be less. In children <2 years old, antibody
response to most capsular types is generally poor. In addition, response to some important pediatric
pneumococcal types (e.g., 6A and 14) is decreased in children <5 years old (12,13).
Following vaccination of healthy adults with polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, antibody levels for
most pneumococcal vaccine types remain elevated at least 5 years; in some persons, they fall to
prevaccination levels within 10 years (14,15). A more rapid decline in antibody levels may occur in
children. In children who have undergone splenectomy following trauma and in those with sickle cell
disease, antibody titers for some types can fall to prevaccination levels 3-5 years after vaccination
(16,17). Similar rates of decline can occur in children with nephrotic syndrome (18).
Patients with AIDS have been shown to have an impaired antibody response to pneumococcal
vaccine (10,19). However, asymptomatic HIV-infected men or those with persistent generalized
lymphadenopathy respond to the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (20).
VACCINE EFFICACY
In the 1970s, pneumococcal vaccine was shown to reduce significantly the occurrence of pneumonia
in young, healthy populations in South Africa and Papua New Guinea, where incidence of pneumonia
is high (21,22). It was also demonstrated to protect against systemic pneumococcal infection in
hyposplenic patients in the United States (23). Since then, studies have attempted to assess vaccine
efficacy in other U.S. populations (24–30; CDC, unpublished data) (Table 1). A prospective, ongoing
case-control study in Connecticut has shown an overall protective efficacy of 61% against pneumo-
coccal bacteremia caused by vaccine- and vaccine-related serotypes. The protective efficacy was 60%
for patients with alcoholism or chronic pulmonary, cardiac, or renal disease and 64% for patients 55
years old without other high-risk chronic conditions (25,26). In another multicenter case-control study,
vaccine efficacy in immunocompetent persons >55 years old was 70% (27). A smaller case-control
study of veterans failed to show efficacy in preventing pneumococcal bacteremia (28), but determi-
nation of the vaccination status was judged to be inadequate and the selection of controls was
considered to be potentially biased.
Studies based on CDC's pneumococcal surveillance system suggest an efficacy of 60%-64% for
vaccine-type strains in patients with bacteremic disease. For all persons >65 years of age (including
persons with chronic heart disease, pulmonary disease, or diabetes mellitus), vaccine efficacy was

44%–61% (29; CDC, unpublished data). In addition, estimates of vaccine efficacy for serologically
related types were 29%-66% (29). Limited data suggest that clinical efficacy may decline > 6 years after
vaccination (CDC, unpublished data).
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among high-risk veterans showed no vaccine
efficacy against pneumococcal pneumonia or bronchitis (30); however, case definitions used were
judged to have uncertain specificity. In addition, this study had only a 6% ability to detect a vaccine
efficacy of 65% for pneumococcal bacteremia (31 ). In contrast, a French clinical trial found pneumo-
coccal vaccine to be 77% effective in reducing the incidence of pneumonia in nursing home residents
(32).
Despite conflicting findings, the data continue to support the use of the pneumococcal vaccine for
certain well-defined groups at risk.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR VACCINE USE
Adults
1. Immunocompetent adults who are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease or its complications
because of chronic illnesses (e.g., cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus,
alcoholism, cirrhosis, or cerebrospinal fluid leaks) or who are >65 years old.
2. Immunocompromised adults at increased risk of pneumococcal disease or its complications (e.g.,
persons with splenic dysfunction or anatomic asplenia, Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma, multiple
myeloma, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, or conditions such as organ transplantation
associated with immunosuppression).
3. Adults with asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV infection.
Children
1. Children >2 years old with chronic illnesses specifically associated with increased risk of pneumo-
coccal disease or its complications (e.g., anatomic or functional asplenia [including sickle cell
disease), nephrotic syndrome, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and conditions associated with immuno-
suppression).
2. Children >2 years old with asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV infection.
3. The currently available 23-valent vaccine is not indicated for patients having only recurrent upper
respiratory tract disease, including otitis media and sinusitis.
Special Groups
Persons living in special environments or social settings with an identified increased risk of
pneumococcal disease or its complications (e.g., certain Native American populations).
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Approximately 50% of persons given pneumococcal vaccine develop mild side effects, such as
erythema and pain at the injection site. Fever, myalgia, and severe local reactions have been reported
in <1% of those vaccinated. Severe systemic reactions, such as anaphylaxis, rarely have been
reported.
PRECAUTIONS
The safety of pneumococcal vaccine for pregnant women has not been evaluated. Ideally, women
at high risk of pneumococcal disease should be vaccinated before pregnancy.
TIMING OF VACCINATION
When elective splenectomy is being considered, pneumococcal vaccine should be given at least 2
weeks before the operation, if possible. Similarly, for planning cancer chemotherapy or immunosup-
pressive therapy, as in patients who undergo organ transplantation, the interval between vaccination
and initiation of chemotherapy or immunosuppression should also be at least 2 weeks.
REVACCINATION
In one study, local reactions after revaccination in adults were more severe than after initial
vaccination when the interval between vaccinations was 13 months (33) (Table 2). Reports of
revaccination after longer intervals in children and adults, including a large group of elderly persons
revaccinated at least 4 years after primary vaccination, suggest a similar incidence of such reactions
after primary vaccination and revaccination (unpublished data; 17,34–38 ).
Without more information, persons who received the 14-valent pneumococcal vaccine should not be
routinely revaccinated with the 23-valent vaccine, as increased coverage is modest and duration of
protection is not well defined. However, revaccination with the 23-valent vaccine should be strongly
considered for persons who received the 14-valent vaccine if they are at highest risk of fatal
3


## p. 4 (#288) ##############################################

pneumococcal infection (e.g., asplenic patients). Revaccination should also be considered for adults at
highest risk who received the 23-valent vaccine > 6 years before and for those shown to have rapid
decline in pneumococcal antibody levels (e.g., patients with nephrotic syndrome, renal failure, or
transplant recipients). Revaccination after 3—5 years should be considered for children with nephrotic
syndrome, asplenia, or sickle cell anemia who would be <10 years old at revaccination.
STRATEGIES FOR VACCINE DELIVERY
Recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination have been made by the ACIP, the American
Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, and the American Academy of Family
Physicians. Recent analysis indicates that pneumococcal vaccination of elderly persons is cost-
effective (39). The vaccine is targeted for approximately 27 million persons aged >65 years and 21
million persons aged <65 years with high-risk conditions (1). Despite Medicare reimbursement for
costs of the vaccine and its administration, which began in 1981, annual use of pneumococcal vaccine
has not increased above levels observed in earlier years (40) (Figure 1). In 1985, <10% of the 48 million
persons considered to be at increased risk of serious pneumococcal infection were estimated to have
ever received pneumococcal vaccine (1).
Opportunities to vaccinate high-risk persons are missed both at time of hospital discharge and
during visits to clinicians' offices. Two thirds or more of patients with serious pneumococcal disease
had been hospitalized at least once within 5 years before their pneumococcal illness, yet few had
received pneumococcal vaccine (40). More effective programs for vaccine delivery are needed,
including offering pneumococcal vaccine in hospitals (at the time of discharge), clinicians' offices,
nursing homes, and other chronic-care facilities. Many patients who receive pneumococcal vaccine
should also be immunized with influenza vaccine (41), which can be given simultaneously at a
different site. In contrast to pneumococcal vaccine, influenza vaccine is given annually.
VACCINE DEVELOPMENT
A more immunogenic pneumococcal vaccine preparation is needed, particularly for children <2
years old. The development of a protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine for selected capsular types
holds promise.

Recommendation of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
Meningococcal Vaccines
INTRODUCTION
A polysaccharide vaccine against disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C, Y,
and W-135 is currently licensed in the United States. This statement updates the previous statement
(MMWR 1978;27:327-9), summarizes available information on the vaccine, and offers guidelines
for its use in the civilian population of the United States.
MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE
N. meningitidis causes both endemic and epidemic disease, principally meningitis and meningo-
coccemia. It is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in the United States (approxi-
mately 20% of all cases), affecting an estimated 3,000-4,000 people each year. The case-fatality
rate is approximately 10% for meningococcal meningitis and 20% for meningococcemia, despite
therapy with antimicrobial agents, such as penicillin, to which all strains remain highly sensitive.
No major epidemic of meningococcal disease has occurred in the United States since 1946, al-
though localized community outbreaks have been reported. The incidence of endemic meningococcal
disease peaks in the late winter to early spring. Attack rates are highest among children aged 6-12
months and then steadily decline; by age 5 years, the incidence approximates that for adults.
Serogroup B, for which a vaccine is not yet available, accounts for 50%-55% of all cases; serogroup
C, for 20%-25%; and serogroup W-135, for 15%. Serogroups Y (10%) and A (1%-2%) account for
nearly all remaining cases. Serogroup W-135 has emerged as a major cause of disease only since
1975 (1). While serogroup A causes only a small proportion of endemic disease in the United States,
it is the most common cause of epidemics elsewhere. Less commonly, serogroups C and B can also
cause epidemic disease.
People with certain chronic conditions appear to be at increased risk of developing meningococcal
infection. Meningococcal disease is particularly common among individuals with component deficien-
cies in the final common complement pathway (C3, C5-C9), many of whom experience multiple epi-
sodes of infection (2). Asplenic persons seem also to be at increased risk of developing meningococ-
cal disease and experience particularly severe infections (3). It is uncertain whether individuals with
other diseases associated with immunosuppression are at higher risk of acquiring meningococcal dis-
ease, as they are for disease caused by other encapsulated bacteria. In the past, new military recruits
were at especially high risk, particularly for serogroup C disease; however, since routine vaccination
of recruits with the bivalent A/C vaccine began in 1971, disease caused by those serogroups has
been uncommon. Military recruits currently receive the A,C,Y.W-135 vaccine.
MENINGOCOCCAL POLYSACCHARIDE VACCINES
The recently licensed quadrivalent A,C,Y,W-135 vaccine (Menomune – A/C/Y/W-135, manu-
factured by Squibb-Connaught) is the formulation currently available in the United States. The vac-
cine consists of 50 ug each of the respective purified bacterial capsular polysaccharides.
Vaccine efficacy. Numerous studies have demonstrated the immunogenicity and clinical efficacy
of the A and C vaccines. The serogroup A polysaccharide induces antibody in some children as
young as 3 months of age, although a response comparable to that seen in adults is not achieved
until 4 or 5 years of age; the serogroup C component does not induce a good antibody response
before age 18-24 months (4,5). The serogroup A vaccine has been shown to have a clinical efficacy
of 85%-95% and to be of use in controlling epidemics. A similar level of clinical efficacy has been
demonstrated for the serogroup C vaccine, both in American military recruits and in an epidemic. The
group Y and W-135 polysaccharides have been shown to be safe and immunogenic in adults (6-9)
and in children over 2 years of age; clinical protection has not been demonstrated directly, but is as-
sumed, based on the production of bactericidal antibody, which for group C has been correlated with
clinical protection. The antibody responses to each of the four polysaccharides in the quadrivalent
vaccine are serogroup-specific and independent.


## p. 4 (#292) ##############################################

Duration of efficacy. Antibodies against the group A and C polysaccharides decline markedly over
the first 3 years following a single dose of vaccine (5,10-13). This antibody decline is more rapid in
infants and young children than in adults. Similarly, while vaccine-induced clinical protection probably
persists in schoolchildren and adults for at least 3 years, a recent study in Africa has demonstrated a
marked decline in the efficacy of the group A vaccine in young children over time. In this study, effica-
cy declined from greater than 90% to less than 10% over 3 years in those under 4 years of age at the
time of vaccination; in older children, efficacy was still 67% 3 years after vaccination (14).
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR VACCINE USE
Routine vaccination of civilians with meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is not recommended
for the following reasons: (1) the risk of infection in the United States is low; (2) a vaccine against
serogroup B, the major cause of meningococcal disease in the United States, is not yet available; and
(3) much of the meningococcal disease in the United States occurs among children too young to
benefit from the vaccine. However, the vaccine has been shown to be of use in aborting outbreaks
due to serogroups represented in the vaccine and should be used in their control. In an outbreak, the
serogroup should be determined and the population at risk delineated by neighborhood, school,
dormitory, or other reasonable boundary. Although endemic disease is very uncommon above age 5
years, older children, adolescents, and young adults constitute a higher proportion of cases during
epidemics and may warrant vaccination during an outbreak (15).
Routine immunization with the quadrivalent vaccine is recommended for particular high-risk
groups, including individuals with terminal complement component deficiencies and those with
anatomic or functional asplenia. Persons splenectomized because of trauma or nonlymphoid tumors
and those with inherited complement deficiencies have acceptable antibody responses to meningo-
coccal vaccine, although clinical efficacy has not been documented (2,16). It should be recognized
that such individuals frequently have preexisting antibody against N. meningitidis and may not be
protected by vaccination.
Vaccination with the A-C vaccine may benefit some travelers to countries recognized as having hy-
perendemic or epidemic disease and Americans living in these areas, particularly those who will have
prolonged contact with the local populace. One area of the world recognized as having recurrent
epidemics of meningococcal disease is the part of sub-Saharan Africa known as the "meningitis
belt," which extends from Mauritania in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Epidemics have been recog-
nized in other parts of the world, and updated information can be obtained from travelers' clinics,
state health departments, and CDC.
Primary Immunization. For both adults and children, vaccine is administered subcutaneously as a
single 0.5-ml dose. The vaccine can be given at the same time as other immunizations, if needed.
Good antibody levels are achieved within 10-14 days after vaccination.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
Reactions. Adverse reactions to meningococcal vaccine are mild and infrequent, consisting princi-
pally of localized erythema lasting 1-2 days. Up to 2% of young children develop fever transiently
after vaccination (13).
Pregnancy. On theoretical grounds, it is prudent not to immunize pregnant women unless there is
a substantial risk of infection. However, evaluation of the vaccine in pregnant women during an
epidemic in Brazil demonstrated no adverse effects. Further, antibody studies in these women
showed good antibody levels in maternal and cord blood following vaccination during any trimester;
antibody levels in the infants declined over the first few months and did not affect their subsequent
response to immunization (17).
REVACCINATION
Revaccination may be indicated for individuals at high risk of infection, particularly children who
were first immunized under 4 years of age; such children should be considered for revaccination after
2 or 3 years if they remain at high risk. The need for revaccination in older children and adults remains
unknown.


## p. 5 (#293) ##############################################

PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINES
Work is continuing on a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine, as well as on improved A and C vac-
cines. Candidate vaccines include capsular polysaccharides complexed with meningococcal outer-
membrane proteins or covalently linked to carrier proteins. Clinical efficacy data for these vaccines
are not available.
ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS
Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of intimate contacts remains the chief preventive measure in
sporadic cases of N. meningitidis disease in the United States. Intimate contacts include (1) house-
hold members, (2) day-care-center contacts, and (3) anyone directly exposed to the patient's oral se-
cretions, such as through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or kissing. The attack rate for household
contacts is 0.3%-1%, 300-1,000 times the rate in the general population.
Unless the causative organism is known to be sensitive to sulfadiazine, the drug of choice is rifam-
pin, given twice daily for 2 days (600 mg every 12 hours to adults; 10 mg/kg every 12 hours to child-
ren 1 month of age or older; 5 mg/kg every 12 hours to children under 1 month of age). Rifampin has
been shown to be 90% effective in eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage. No serious adverse effects
have been noted. However, rifampin prophylaxis is not recommended for pregnant women, as the
drug is teratogenic in laboratory animals. Also, as well as turning urine orange, rifampin is excreted in
tears, resulting in staining of contact lenses; thus, they should not be used during the course of
therapy
Because systemic antimicrobial therapy of meningococcal disease does not reliably eradicate
nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningiditis, it is also important to give chemoprophylaxis to the index
patient before discharge from the hospital (18).
Nasopharyngeal cultures are not helpful in determining who warrants chemoprophylaxis and unne-
cessarily delay institution of this preventive measure.

Recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
Immunization of Children Infected With
Human Immunodeficiency Virus – Supplementary ACIP Statement
The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recently reviewed data both on the risks and
benefits of immunizing children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (7) and on severe
and fatal measles in HIV-infected children in the United States (2). Since this review, the committee
has revised its previous recommendations for measles vaccination and for mumps and rubella
vaccination.
Previously published ACIP statements on immunizing HIV-infected children have recommended
vaccinating children with asymptomatic HIV infection, but not those with symptomatic HIV infection
(3). After considering reports of severe measles in symptomatic HIV-infected children, and in the
absence of reports of serious or unusual adverse effects of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)
vaccination in limited studies of symptomatic patients (4,5), the committee feels that administration of
MMR vaccine should be considered for all HIV-infected children, regardless of symptoms. This
approach is consistent with the World Health Organization's recommendation for measles vaccination
(6).
If the decision to vaccinate is made, symptomatic HIV-infected children should receive MMR vaccine
at 15 months, the age currently recommended for vaccination of children without HIV infection and for
those with asymptomatic HIV infection. When there is an increased risk of exposure to measles, such
as during an outbreak, these children should receive vaccine at younger ages. At such times, infants
6 to 11 months of age should receive monovalent measles vaccine and should be revaccinated with
MMR at 12 months of age or older. Children 12-14 months of age should receive MMR and do not need
revaccination (7).
The use of high-dose intravenous immune globulin (IGIV) (approximately 5 gm% protein) admin-
istered at regular intervals is being studied to determine whether it will prevent a variety of infections
in HIV-infected children. It should be recognized that MMR vaccine may be ineffective if administered
to a child who has received IGIV during the preceding 3 months.
Immune globulin (IG) (16.5 gm% protein) can be used to prevent or modify measles infection in
HIV-infected children if administered within 6 days of exposure. IG is indicated for measles-
susceptible* household contacts of children with asymptomatic HIV infection, particularly for those
under 1 year of age and for measles-susceptible pregnant women. The recommended dose is 0.25
ml/kg intramuscularly (maximum dose, 15 mL) (7).
In contrast, exposed symptomatic HIV-infected patients should receive IG prophylaxis regardless of
vaccination status. The standard postexposure measles prophylaxis regimen for such patients is 0.5
ml/kg of IG intramuscularly (maximum dose, 15 mL) (7). This regimen corresponds to a dose of
protein of approximately 82.5 mg/kg (maximum dose, 2,475 mg). Intramuscular IG may not be
necessary if a patient with HIV infection is receiving 100-400 mg/kg IGIV at regular intervals and
received the last dose within 3 weeks of exposure to measles. Based on the amount of protein that can
be administered, high-dose IGIV may be as effective as IG given intramuscularly. However, no data
exist on the efficacy of IGIV administered postexposure in preventing measles.
Although postexposure administration of globulins to symptomatic HIV-infected patients is recom-
mended regardless of measles vaccine status, vaccination prior to exposure is desirable. Measles
exposures are often unrecognized, and postexposure prophylaxis is not always possible.
*Persons who are unvaccinated or do not have laboratory evidence or physician documentation of previous
measles disease (7).

While recommendations for MMR vaccine have changed, those for other vaccines have not (3). A

recommendations apply to adolescents and adults with HIV infection as well as to HIV-infected
children.

Recommendation of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
Immunization of Children Infected with
Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type 111/
Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus
INTRODUCTION
This document is intended to summarize available information and to assist health-care providers in develop-
ing policies for the
for the immunization of children infected with human T-lymphotropic virus type
III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAVIthe virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syn-
drome (AIDS). These policies may vary depending upon the prevalence of HTLV-III/LAV infection and the inci-
dence of vaccine-preventable diseases in the community, individual assessment of a child's health status, and
the risks and benefits of immunization in a particular situation. This discussion considers the risks and benefits of
immunization for children residing in the United States based on the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases and
the prevalence of HTLV-III/LAV infection and is intended for use by health-care providers in the United States.
The recommendations may not pertain to other countries with different risks of vaccine-preventable diseases
and prevalence of HTLV-11I/LAV infection among children. Since these recommendations are based upon infor-
mation and knowledge available at this time, periodic reassessment and revision will be required as more data
concerning risk and benefits associated with immunization of HTLV-III/LAV-infected children become known
and as the prevalences of specific vaccine-preventable diseases and HTLV-III infection change.
HTLV-11I/LAV INFECTION AMONG CHILDREN
In the period June 1, 1981-September 2, 1986, physicians and health departments in the United States
reported 24,430 cases of AIDS to CDC (1). Three hundred forty-five (1%) of the case-patients were children
under 13 years of age who met the AIDS case definition; 75% of these pediatric cases were reported from New
York, Florida, New Jersey, and California. Childrun with less severe manifestations of HTLV-III/LAV infection
(AIDS-related complex, or ARC) or with asymptomatic infections are not now reported to CDC, and no sero-
prevalence studies have been conducted among children. Thus, the number of less severely affected children
and the number of infected but presently asymptomatic children are uncertain. In one recently published case
sorios, 14 (48%) of 29 symptomatic HTLV-III/LAV-infected children met the CDC criteria for AIDS (2).
Fifty percent of children reported to CDC were diagnosed as having AIDS during the first year of life; 82%. by
3 years of age (1). Sixty-five percent of pediatric AIDS cases reported to CDC were fatal (3). Short-term fatality
rates are lower for children with less severe disease (ARC) who have not developed opportunistic infections;
however, the ultimate prognosis of these children and of asymptomatic infected children is unknown.
MECHANISMS OF TRANSMISSION OF HTLV-11I/LAV AMONG CHILDREN
Two risk factors are predominately associated with HTLV-III/LAV infection in children: a) being born to a
mother who has HTLV-III/LAV infection, and b) receiving blood or clotting factors containing HTLV-III/LAV. Most
case-patients (79%) are children whose mothers probably are intected with the virus. The major risk factors for
intoction of these women are intravenous (IV) drug abuse and sexual contact with men at risk of HTLV-III/LAV in-
foction (primarily through drug abuse or bisexual contacts); women of Haitian or central African origin are also at
a higher risk of acquiring HTLV-III/LAV infection, and a small percentage of infected women have a history of
being transfused with blood (4). Approximately 15% of pediatric AIDS case-patients have received transfusions
of blood or blood products, and 4% have hemophilia and have been treated with clotting-factor concentrates. In-
formation about risk factors is incomplete for 3% of children with AIDS.
'The AIDS virus has been variously termed human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III/LAV), lymphadenopathy-associated
virus (LAV), AIDS-associated retrovirus (ARV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The designation "human immunodefi-
ciency virus" (HIV) has been accepted by a subcommittee of the Intemational Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses as the
appropriate name for the retrovirus that has been implicated as the causative agent of AIDS (Science 1986.232:69 7).


## p. 10 (#298) #############################################

Currently available data indicate that most pediatric HTLV-III/LAV infections are acquired from infected
women during pregnancy, during labor and delivery, or perhaps shortly after birth. The risk of perinatal transmis-
sion from an infected mother to her infant is not known, although prospective studies indicate the rate of trans-
mission has ranged from 0% (0/3) to 65% (13/20) (5-7). Seropositive women who had previously delivered an
infected child had the highest of these transmission rates (65%) in subsequent pregnancies (5). In a retrospective
study evaluating nine children whose mothers were later diagnosed as having AIDS, two (22%) children had anti-
body to HTLV-III/LAV (8). Additional prospective studies are needed to define more precisely the rate of perinatal
transmission of HTLV-III/LAV.
PREVALENCE OF HTLV-111/LAV INFECTION AMONG WOMEN OF CHILD-BEARING AGE
The prevalence of HTLV-III/LAV infection among women of child-bearing age varies depending on the patient
group and geographic area (4). Reported confirmed seroprevalences are less than 0.01% among female blood
donors in Atlanta and 0.06% among female U.S. military recruit applicants (4,9). In contrast, the reported preval-
ence of HTLV-III/LAV antibody among IV drug abusers has ranged from 2% to 59%, with the highest prevalence
in New York City and northern New Jersey. Female sex partners of IV drug-abusing men with AIDS or with ARC
had a reported seroprevalence of 40%-71%, whereas 10% of female partners of asymptomatic infected hemoph-
iliacs were reported to be seropositive (4). Seroprevalence among prostitutes has varied greatly (5%-40%)
depending on the geographic area and has been largely attributed to a coincidental history of IV drug abuse (4).
Seroprevalence has been reported to be as high as 5% among persons born in countries in which heterosexual
transmission of HTLV-III/LAV is thought to play a major role (e.g., Haiti, central African countries) (1,10,11).
IMMUNOLOGIC ABNORMALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH HTLV-111/LAV INFECTION
Children with symptomatic HTLV-III/LAV infection (AIDS or ARC) have immunologic abnormalities similar to
those of adult AIDS patients, including hypergammaglobulinemia, decreased T4 lymphocytes, reversed helperi -
suppressor T-cell ratios, poor T-lymphocyte responses to mitogen stimulation, and altered humoral immunity.
Lymphopenia (cell counts less than 1,500 cells/mm3) is uncommon. Antibody responses of children with AIDS or ARC
to diphtheria and tetanus toxoid boosters and to pneumococcal vaccine were absent or lower than those of age-matched
controls, which is consistent with defective humoral immunity (12,13). Some HTLV-III/LAV-infected children responded ad-
equately to immunization; 60% of AIDS and ARC patients given measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) prior to diagnosis
had protective levels of measles antibodies 5-66 months after immunization (14).
Asymptomatic HTLV-III/LAV-infected adults as a group generally have less severe abnormalities of immunologic function
than adults with AIDS or ARC, and some may have normal immunologic function, although individual asymptomatic adults
may have severe abnormalities (15). Immunologic function of asymptomatic HTLV-11I/LAV-infected children has not yet
been adequately studied but presumably would be more intact than that of symptomatic HTLV-III/LAV-infected children. In a
small prospective study, all 29 children with symptomatic HTLV-III/LAV infection had immunologic abnormalities within
5-13 months of being found infected, compared with only two of seven (29%) children reported to have asymptomatic
HTLV-III/LAV infection (2).
CONCERNS ABOUT IMMUNIZATION OF HTLV-111/LAV-INFECTED CHILDREN
The immunologic abnormalities associated with symptomatic HTLV-III/LAV infection have raised concerns about the im-
munization of infected children. Replication of live, attenuated vaccine viruses may be enhanced in persons with immunodefi-
ciency diseases and theoretically may produce serious adverse events following immunization of symptomatic HTLV-
III/LAV-infected (AIDS and ARC) patients (16). Concerns have been expressed on theoretical grounds that antigenic stimula-
tion by immunization with inactivated vaccines might lead to a deterioration of clinical status of HTLV-III/LAV-infected child-
ren, but this effect has not been documented (17). Since symptomatic HTLV-III/LAV-infected patients have abnormal pri-
mary and secondary antibody responses, the efficacy of immunization may be decreased (18). The efficacy of immunization
for asymptomatic HTLV-III/LAV-infected children is unknown, but presumably would be higher than for symptomatic HTLV-
III/LAV-infected children.
Because most HTLV-11I/LAV-infected children become infected perinatally, it is to be expected that their mothers are in-
fected with HTLV-III/LAV. Other family members may also be infected with HTLV-11I/LAV and may have abnormal immuno-
logic function. Prospective evaluation of 16 asymptomatic HTLV-111/LAV-infected mothers of children diagnosed as having
AIDS or ARC showed that 12 (75%) mothers developed AIDS or ARC during a 30-month follow-up period (6). Regardless of
the immune status of the recipient, poliovaccine virus is often excreted by children vaccinated with oral poliovaccine (OPV)
and may be transmitted to close contacts (19). Immune-deficient individuals (either recipients or contacts) have a higher risk
of developing vaccine-associated poliomyelitis than normal individuals. There is no risk of transmitting the viruses contained
in measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine to family members (20-22).
While the risks of vaccination are not known with certainty, potential risks may exist if HTLV-III/LAV-infected children are
not vaccinated. If local outbreaks of measles occur in geographic areas in which there is both a cluster of unvaccinated child-
ren and a high prevalence of HTLV-III/LAV infection, the risk of measles for unvaccinated, HTLV-III/LAV-infected children
may be high. Measles infection among patients with immune deficiency may be severe, protracted, and fatal (23).
tsuch family members may have been infected by sexual contact with an HTLV-111/LAV-infected person, by parenteral expo-
sure to infected blood (e.g., by sharing needles), or as hemophiliacs who received clotting factors, or by perinatal
transmission.

EXPERIENCES WITH IMMUNIZATION OF HTLV-111/LAV-INFECTED PERSONS
Some children infected perinatally with HTLV-III/LAV have received routine immunization with OPV and MMR before their
illnesses were recognized. Out-patient medical records from New York City and Miami for 213 children with symptomatic
HTLV-III/LAV infection (AIDS and ARC), presumably acquired during the perinatal period, were reviewed to determine im-
munization history and possible vaccine-associated adverse events (24,25). One hundred seventy-one children (80%) had re-
ceived at least one dose of OPV and diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP), 95 (45%) had completed pri-
mary immunization with OPV and DTP (three doses and four doses, respectively), and 63 (30%) had received MMR or mea-
sles vaccine. Thirty-eight (39%) of 98 children who had available records of dates of immunization and onset of symptoms
consistent with HTLV-III/LAV infection had received at least one live-virus vaccine after symptom onset. No serious or unusual
adverse events were noted in the medical records of these children following immunization.
Only one adverse event following immunization of an HTLV-III/LAV-infected person has been documented. A 19-year-old
asymptomatic army recruit received multiple immunizations during basic training, including primary immunization with small-
pox vaccine (26). Two and one-half weeks later, he developed cryptococcal meningitis and was diagnosed as having AIDS.
One and one-half weeks later, while being treated for meningitis, he developed lesions of disseminated vaccinia. He was treat-
ed with vaccinia immune globulin and recovered from vaccinia, but has since died of AIDS.
CDC has not received any reports of vaccine-associated poliomyelitis among HTLV-III/LAV-infected vaccine recipients or
their contacts or among other persons known to be infected with HTLV-III/LAV. There have been no reports of serious ad-
verse events following MMR administration from areas in which pediatric AIDS cases are occurring.
IMMUNIZING CHILDREN WHO MAY BE INFECTED WITH HTLV-III/LAV : SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Children born to women who are at risk of HTLV-III/LAV infection or who are known to be infected with HTLV-11I/LAV
should be evaluated for infection with the virus – including being tested for antibody (4,27). For asymptomatic children pre-
senting for immunization, this evaluation and testing is not necessary to make decisions about immunizations. Children infect-
ed with HTLV-III/LAV are best cared for by pediatricians knowledgeable in the management of patients with this infection.
Since little information is currently available on the safety and efficacy of immunizing children who may be infected with
HTLV-III/LAV, special studies of these children need to be conducted.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Children with symptomatic HTLV-11I/LAV infection
A. Live-virus and live-bacterial vaccines (e.g., MMR, OPV, BCG) should not be given to children and young adults who are im-
munosuppressed in association with AIDS or other clinical manifestations of HTLV-III/LAV infection. For routine immuniza-
tions, these persons should receive inactivated poliovaccine (IPV) and should be excused for medical reasons from regula-
tions requiring measles, rubella, and/or mumps immunization.
B. Concerns have been raised that stimulation of the immune system by immunization with inactivated vaccines in these indi-
viduals might cause deterioration in immunologic function. However, such effects have not been noted thus far among
children with AIDS or among other immunosuppressed individuals after immunization with inactivated vaccines. The
potential benefits of immunization of these children outweigh the concerns of theoretical adverse events. Immunization
with DTP, IPV, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines is recommended in accordance with the ACIP recommenda-
tions, although immunization may be less effective than it would be for immunocompetent children (28-30).
C. As with other conditions that produce chronic immunosuppression, the Committee recommends annual immunization
with inactivated influenza vaccine for children over 6 months of age and one-time administration of pneumococcal vaccine
for children over 2 years of age (31-33).
D. Children and young adults with AIDS or other clinical manifestations of HTLV-111/LAV infection- as other immunosup-
pressed patients – may be at increased risk of having serious complications of infectious diseases, such as measles and
varicella. Following significant exposure to measles or varicella, these persons should receive passive immunization with
immune globulin (1G) or varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG), respectively (20,34).
Children with previously diagnosed asymptomatic HTLV-III/LAV infection
A. A small number of children and young adults known to be infected with HTLV-III/LAV but without overt clinical manifesta-
tions of immunosuppression have received live-virus vaccines without adverse consequences. Further experience needs
to be monitored, but on the basis of data now available, the Committee believes that such persons should be vaccinated
with MMR in accordance with ACIP recommendations (20-22). Vaccinees should be followed for possible adverse reac-
tions and for the occurrence of vaccine-preventable diseases since immunization may be less effective than for uninfected
persons.
B. Available data suggest that OPV can be administered without adverse consequences to HTLV-III/LAV-infected children
who do not have overt clinical manifestations of immunosuppression. However, because family members of such children
may be immunocompromised due to AIDS or HTLV-III/LAV infection and therefore at increased risk of paralysis from con-
tact with spread vaccine virus, it may be prudent to use IPV routinely to immunize asymptomatic children with previously
diagnosed HTLV-III/LAV infection (28).
C. Immunization with DTP and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines is recommended in accordance with ACIP recom-
mendations (29,30).
Some physicians administer full replacement doses of intravenous IG on a 2-4 week schedule to children with AIDS and
other clinical manifestations of HTLV-III/LAV infection. This therapy may provide some protection against such diseases as
measles and varicella.

Children not known to be infected with HTLV-1!I/LAV
Children and young adults not known to be infected with HTLV-11I/LAV should be iminunized in accordance with ACIP
recommendations.
Chiidren residing in the household of a patient with AIDS
Children whose househoid members are known to be immunocompromised due to AIDS or other HTLV-III/L.AV infections
should not receive OPV because vaccine viruses are excreted by the recipient of the vaccine and may be communicable to
their immunosuppressed contacts. These children should receive IPV for routine immunization (28). Because extensive ex-
perience has shown that live, attenuated MMR vaccine viruses are not transmitted from vaccinated individuals to others,
MMR may be given to a child residing in the household of a patient with AIDS (20-22).

Pages 197-200
National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act:
Requirements for Permanent Vaccination Records and for
Reporting of Selected Events After Vaccination
Since March 21, 1988, health-care providers who administer certain vaccines and toxoids are
required by law to record permanently certain information and to report certain events.* The vaccines
and toxoids to which these requirements apply follow: diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis
vaccine (DTP); pertussis vaccine (P); measles, mumps, and rubella single-antigen vaccines and
combination vaccines (MMR, MR); diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (DT); tetanus and diphtheria toxoids
(Td); tetanus toxoid (T); poliovirus vaccine live, oral (OPV); and poliovirus vaccine inactivated (IPV)
(Table 1). The requirements also will apply to DTP combined with inactivated poliovirus vaccine
(DTP/Polio combined) if it becomes available.
Requirements for Recording
Specifically, all health-care providers who administer one or more of these vaccines or toxoids are
required to ensure that there is recorded in the vaccine recipient's permanent medical record (or in a
permanent office log or file) the date the vaccine was administered, the manufacturer and lot number
of the vaccine, and the name, address, and title of the person administering the vaccine. The term
health-care provider is defined as any licensed health-care professional, organization, or institution,
whether private or public (including federal, state, and local departments and agencies), under whose
authority a specified vaccine is administered.
Requirements for Reporting
Health-care providers are required to report to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) selected events occurring after vaccination. Reportable events applicable to the previously
mentioned vaccines and toxoids are shown in Table 1 and include events described in the vaccine
manufacturer's package insert as contraindications to receiving additional doses of the vaccine.
Methods for Reporting
In the United States, vaccines are either publicly or privately purchased. Publicly purchased vaccines
are bought with federal, state, and/or local government funds. At present, the method and route for
reporting adverse events depend on whether the vaccine administered is publicly or privately
purchased. Events occurring after receipt of publicly purchased vaccines are reported through local,
county, and/or state health departments to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on its Report of
Adverse Events Following Immunization (CDC form 71.19). Events occurring after receipt of a privately
purchased vaccine usually are reported directly to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on its
Adverse Reaction Report (FDA form 1639) by the health-care provider or the manufacturer.
For the time being, these two systems for reporting adverse events are to be used to implement the
requirement of Title XXI of the Public Health Service Act for reporting adverse events to DHHS
(Table 2).
Reportable events occurring after receipt of a publicly purchased vaccine shall be reported to local,
county, and/or state health departments through channels currently in place at those institutions. The
Report of Adverse Events Following Immunization, available at each state health department, shall be
completed and sent by the state health department to CDC.

"Aids to Interpretation:
Shock-collapse or hypotonic-hyporesponsive collapse may be evidenced by signs or symptoms such as decrease in or loss of muscle tone,
paralysis (partial or complete), hemiplegia, hemiparesis, loss of color or turning pale white or blue, unresponsiveness to environmental stimuli,
depression of or loss of consciousness, prolonged sleeping with difficulty arousing, or cardiovascular or respiratory arrest.
Residual seizure disorder may be considered to have occurred if no other seizure or convulsion unaccompanied by fever or accompanied by a fever
of less than 102 °F occurred before the first seizure or convulsion after the administration of the vaccine involved,
AND, if in the case of measles-, mumps-, or rubella-containing vaccines, the first seizure or convulsion occurred within 15 days after vaccination
OR in the case of any other vaccine, the first seizure or convulsion occurred within 3 days after vaccination,
AND, if two or more seizures or convulsions unaccompanied by fever or accompanied by a fever of less than 102 °F occurred within 1 year after
vaccination.
The terms seizure and convulsion include grand mal, petit mal, absence, myoclonic, tonic-clonic, and focal motor seizures and signs.
Encephalopathy means any significant acquired abnormality, of, injury to, or impairment of function of the brain. Among the frequent
manifestations of encephalopathy are focal and diffuse neurologic signs, increased intracranial pressure, or changes lasting at least 6 hours in level
of consciousness, with or without convulsions. The neurologic signs and symptoms of encephalopathy may be temporary with complete recovery,
or they may result in various degrees of permanent impairment. Signs and symptoms such as high-pitched and unusual screaming, persistent
unconsolable crying, and bulging fontanel are compatible with an encephalopathy, but in and of themselves are not conclusive evidence of
encepha-
lopathy. Encephalopathy usually can be documented by slow wave activity on an electroencephalogram.
'The health-care provider must refer to the CONTRAINDICATION section of the manufacturer's package insert for each vaccine.

Recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
Use of BCG Vaccines in the Control of Tuberculosis:
A Joint Statement by the ACIP
and the Advisory Committee for Elimination of Tuberculosis
Since 1979, when the last Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) statement on
vaccination with Bacillus of Calmette and Guérin (BCG*) was published, additional data have been
published on the epidemiology of tuberculosis (TB) in the United States and on the efficacy of
childhood BCG vaccines. As a result, ACIP and the Advisory Committee for Elimination of Tuberculosis
have issued the following educational update on BCG vaccines."
Immunization with BCG vaccine lowers the risk of serious complications of primary TB in children
(1-4). However, BCG vaccination should be considered only for children with negative tuberculin skin
tests who fall into the following categories: 1) those who cannot be placed on isoniazid preventive
therapy but who have continuous exposure to persons with active disease; 2) those with continuous
exposure to patients with organisms resistant to isoniazid and rifampin; or 3) those belonging to
groups with exceptionally high annual rates of new infection (i.e., >1% per year).
BCG vaccination is no longer recommended for health-care workers or other adults at high risk for
acquiring TB infection. In addition, BCG should not be given to persons who are immunocompro-
mised, including those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
INTRODUCTION
Transmission and Pathogenesis of TB
TB is a bacterial disease caused by organisms of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (i.e., M.
tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. africanum). It is transmitted primarily by airborne droplets; infection occurs
when susceptible persons inhale infectious droplets produced by the exhalations of persons with
respiratory tract TB. The risk for infection is directly related to duration and intensity of exposure to air
contaminated with these droplets. TB infection usually begins in the lungs and spreads to the hilar
lymph nodes, then to the blood stream. Thus, disease can occur in any organ of the body. Most
infected persons react to the purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test, and 5%–40% will
develop clinically apparent TB. Infection is more likely to progress to clinical disease in the presence
of certain risk factors, including younger and older ages, male sex, infection within the past 2 years,
leanness, and suppression of cell-mediated immunity.
TB can be presumptively diagnosed if acid-fast bacilli are found in sputum, body fluids, or tissue or
if at least two of three other conditions are met: 1) symptoms are compatible with TB; 2) chest
radiograph is abnormal or abnormalities are found on physical examination; or 3) reaction to the
tu ulin skin test is positive. Definitive diagnosis requires isolation and identification of organisms
of the M. tuberculosis complex from a clinical specimen. Diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB is more
difficult because it requires tissue biopsies or body fluids (e.g., spinal fluid) that usually contain only
a few organisms.
Epidemiology of TB in the United States
TB in the United States has declined approximately 6% per year since nationwide reporting began
in 1953. However, in 1986, the morbidity rate for TB increased slightly to 9.4/100,000, a rate 82% lower
than that for 1953 but 1.1% higher than the 1985 rate. A total of 22,768 cases were reported (5), and
approximately 80% were pulmonary disease.
*Official name: BCG Vaccine.
*Replaces previous recommendation on BCG vaccines (MMWR 1979;28:241-4).

## p. 2 (#308) ##############################################

Untreated TB is fatal in up to 50% of cases. However, chemotherapy has helped reduce the
case-mortality rate 94% since 1953. In 1984, the most recent year for which final mortality data are
available, 1729 deaths were attributed to TB, representing a mortality rate of 0.7/100,000 population.
Prevalence of TB infection and disease varies for different segments of the population. Disease rates
are twice as high in males as in females and increase sharply with age in both sexes and all races.
Groups at high risk for TB include most racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants from countries with a high
prevalence of TB, the homeless population, close contacts of persons with pulmonary TB, and persons
with HIV infection. In 1986, 62% of all TB cases occurred in racial/ethnic minorities, and over 20% of all
cases were in foreign-born persons (5). Although the prevalence of active TB in the homeless
population is difficult to assess, surveillance of selected clinics and shelters showed infection rates
between 1.6% and 6.8% (6). Based on 1985 data from U.S. health departments, 29% of close contacts
of TB patients were infected at the time the patients were diagnosed (7). In addition, the estimated risk
for active TB in persons with symptomatic HIV infection is 100-200 times greater than that of persons
in the general population (8). Persons with asymptomatic HIV infection and M. tuberculosis infection
may have an equally high risk for developing clinical disease.
In 1985, the 1261 cases of TB in children <15 years of age accounted for 5.7% of cases in all age
groups. Eighty percent of these were among racial/ethnic minorities (9). One fourth (315) of all
childhood cases were extrapulmonary; of these, 41 cases were meningeal, and 17 were miliary.
Childhood cases of TB meningitis and miliary TB remained stable between 1981 and 1985, averaging
55 cases annually.
In the past, TB was regarded as an occupational hazard for health-care workers, who had higher
rates of infection and disease than persons of the same age groups in the general population. Although
these rates have decreased over time, persons who work with high-risk patients or in high-prevalence
communities still may be at risk for new infection, defined as conversion from a negative to a positive
tuberculin skin test (10–18). However, in recent studies, which found increased conversion rates
among health-care personnel, rates were highest in health-care workers who did not have patient
contact (10,11), suggesting that conversion resulted from community-acquired infection with M.
tuberculosis or exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria rather than from occupational exposure.
Control of TB
There are four general strategies for controlling TB:
1. The most important and universally applied strategy is the early identification and treatment of
persons with infectious TB. This strategy not only cures the affected person but also renders the
patient noncontagious within a few weeks. Thus, case-finding and treatment programs have both
clinical and public health benefits (19).
2. Identifying and treating persons with noncontagious TB (such as extrapulmonary disease, primary
pulmonary disease in children, bacteriologically unconfirmed pulmonary disease, and tuberculous
infection) can prevent infectious cases (20 ). Therapy to prevent progression of infection to clinical
disease is particularly useful in countries, such as the United States, where the risk of new infection
is low.
3. Use of ventilation and ultraviolet lights will decontaminate air containing infectious droplet nuclei.
Because sites of potential transmission of tubercle bacilli are numerous and difficult to identify in
advance, this strategy is used routinely only where the risk of transmission is known to be
exceptionally high. Some of these areas include mycobacteriology laboratories, sputum induction
cubicles, chest clinic waiting areas, and selected shelters for the homeless. To be effective,
ventilation systems and ultraviolet lights must be properly maintained.
4. In the United States, BCG vaccination is recommended only for uninfected children who are at
unavoidable risk of exposure to TB and for whom other methods of prevention and control have
failed or are not feasible.
BCG VACCINES
BCG was derived from a strain of M. bovis attenuated through years of serial passage in culture by
Calmette and Guérin at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, France. It was first administered to humans in
1921. Many BCG vaccines are available worldwide; all are derived from the original strain but vary in
cultural characteristics and in ability to induce sensitization to tuberculin. BCG vaccines vary because
of genetic changes in the bacterial strains and because of differences in techniques of production, in
methods and routes of vaccine administration, and in characteristics of the populations and environ-
ments in which BCG vaccines have been studied.
2


## p. 3 (#309) ##############################################

Production standards for BCG vaccines, set by the Food and Drug Administration, specify that they
be freeze-dried products containing live bacteria from a documented strain of BCG. The strain must
demonstrate various specified characteristics of safety and potency in animals and induce tuberculin
sensitivity in guinea pigs and humans. The vaccines currently available in the United States have been
evaluated only for their ability to induce a delayed hypersensitivity state.
Vaccine Efficacy Studies
BCG vaccines vary substantially in efficacy. Different preparations of liquid BCG used in controlled
community trials conducted before 1955 gave estimated efficacies ranging from -56% and 80% (21 ).
In 1969, a large controlled trial was begun in Madras (Chingleput) in south India to estimate the efficacy
of two strains of freeze-dried BCG vaccine at two different doses. After 15 years of follow-up, the risk
of sputum-positive pulmonary TB in persons vaccinated with BCG was not lower than that in persons
given placebo (22 ).
Although randomized controlled trials are the most reliable method for assessing vaccine efficacy,
less precise estimates can be obtained more quickly and less expensively by observational studies
(case-control, historical cohort, and cross-sectional studies) in areas where vaccination is performed at
birth. Data from such studies show that the incidence of tuberculous meningitis and miliary TB is
52%-100% lower and that the incidence of pulmonary TB is 2%-80% lower in vaccinated children <15
years of age than in unvaccinated controls (1–4,23,24). However, because vaccination is not allocated
randomly in observational studies, disproportionate exposure to TB may distort the estimates of
vaccine efficacy.
Side Effects and Adverse Reactions
BCG rarely causes serious complications. Side effects vary by vaccine strain; they also vary for the
same strain over time. Side effects occur in 1%-10% of vaccinated persons and usually include severe
or prolonged ulceration at the vaccination site, lymphadenitis, and lupus vulgaris. The risk of side
effects is greater with more potent vaccines. Some vaccine strains have caused osteomyelitis in one
case per million doses administered. Disseminated BCG infection and death have occurred in one to
10 cases per 10 million doses administered, although this problem is restricted almost exclusively to
persons with impaired immunity.
Data on adverse reactions may pertain to the vaccines licensed in the United States. The reported
frequency of complications has varied, depending in part on the intensity of the surveillance effort.
In persons with tuberculous infections, the response to BCG vaccine is accelerated. This accelerated
response is generally characterized by the appearance of induration >5 mm in diameter within 24–48
hours after vaccination, formation of a pustule within 5–7 days, and scab formation and healing in
10–15 days (25). The normal response to BCG vaccine begins 2–3 weeks after vaccination. Scar
formation and healing occur within 3 months.
Interpretation of Tuberculin Test Following BCG Vaccination
The size of tuberculin skin test reactions caused by BCG vaccination (i.e., postvaccination sensitivity)
varies by strain and dose of vaccine, age and nutritional status at vaccination, number of
years since
vaccination, and frequency of tuberculin testing. Mean size of skin test reactions in BCG-vaccinated
children range from 3 mm to 19 mm (26–35). The presence or size of postvaccination tuberculin skin
test reactions does not reliably predict the degree of protection afforded by BCG (36).
After BCG vaccination, it is usually not possible to distinguish between a tuberculin skin test reaction
caused by virulent mycobacterial infection or by vaccination itself (37). Therefore, TB should be
included in the differential diagnosis of any TB-like illness, especially if the person has been recently
exposed to a person with infectious TB or received BCG several years before being tuberculin tested
(38).
General guidelines exist for interpreting tuberculin skin test reactions in BCG vaccine recipients. The
probability that a skin test reaction results from exposure to M. tuberculosis increases 1) as the size of
the reaction increases, 2) when the patient is a contact of a person with TB, especially if that person has
infected others, 3) when there is a family history of TB or when the patient's country of origin has a high
TB prevalence, and 4) as the length of time between vaccination and tuberculin testing increases (38).
For example, a positive skin test (>10 mm) usually can be attributed to M. tuberculosis infection if the
vaccinated person is in a group at high risk for TB or has known exposure to a person with infectious
TB. However, in vaccinated persons who do not belong to groups at high risk for infection and have no
known exposure, a positive skin test reaction probably does not indicate recent infection with M.
tuberculosis.

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS
In the United States, the general population is at low risk for acquiring tuberculous infection.
Furthermore, TB can be controlled successfully in most high-risk groups by modern methods of case
detection, chemotherapy, and preventive therapy. In most population groups, prevention of TB is most
reliably accomplished by periodic Mantoux testing with PPD tuberculin for high-risk children and
adults and with administration of preventive therapy to those whose skin test reactions convert from
negative to positive. Preventive chemotherapy should also be given to tuberculin-positive persons
who are contacts of persons with infectious TB and to other high-risk tuberculin-positive persons (39).
Therefore, a BCG vaccination policy for the entire population is not indicated. However, BCG
vaccination may contribute to TB control in selected population groups. For example, it may benefit
uninfected children who are at high risk for continuous or repeated exposure to infectious persons who
remain undetected or untreated.
Recommended Vaccine Recipients
Exposed tuberculin skin-test-negative infants and children. BCG vaccination is strongly recom-
mended for infants and children with negative tuberculin skin tests who 1) are at high risk of intimate
and prolonged exposure to persistently untreated or ineffectively treated patients with infectious
pulmonary TB, cannot be removed from the source of exposure, and cannot be placed on long-term
preventive therapy, or 2) are continuously exposed to persons with TB who have bacilli resistant to
isoniazid and rifampin.
Groups with an excessive rate of new infections. BCG vaccination is also recommended for
tuberculin-negative infants and children in groups in which the rate of new infections exceeds 1% per
year (40) and for whom the usual surveillance and treatment programs have been attempted but are
not operationally feasible. These groups include persons without regular access to health care, those
for whom usual health care is culturally or socially unacceptable, or groups who have demonstrated
an inability to effectively use existing accessible care.
Discontinued Recommendation for Health-Care Workers
In the past, BCG vaccine was recommended for health-care workers, who as a group experienced
high rates of new infection. However, BCG is no longer recommended for this group. Instead,
health-care workers should be protected by adequate surveillance by periodic tuberculin skin testing
(41) and isoniazid preventive therapy for all skin-test-positive health-care workers who are at high risk
for developing disease. These persons include recent skin test converters and workers who are close
contacts of TB patients or those who have medical conditions such as diabetes, renal failure, or
immunosuppression associated with therapy or disease (39). In addition, hospital infection control
measures, especially the prompt identification and implementation of precautions for patients with
suspected TB, will help reduce the risk of TB transmission to health-care workers (42).
Vaccine Availability
Two BCG vaccine strains licensed in the United States are available. The Glaxo strain is available
from Quad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Indianapolis. The Tice strain is available from Bionetics Research,
Inc., Chicago, or Antigen Supply House, Northridge, California.
Vaccine Dose and Administration
BCG should be reserved for persons whose skin test is negative to 5 tuberculin units of PPD
tuberculin. The Glaxo strain is administered intradermally and the Tice strain percutaneously.
Vaccination should be administered only by the route indicated in the package labeling and only in the
suggested dose.
Infants <30 days old should receive one half the usual dose. If the indications for vaccination persist,
they should receive a fuli dose at 1 year of age.
Freeze-dried vaccine should be reconstituted, protected from exposure to light, refrigerated when
not in use, and used within 8 hours.
Contraindications to Use
BCG should not be given to persons 1) whose immunologic responses are impaired because of
congenital immunodeficiency, HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, or generalized malignancy or 2)
whose immunologic responses have been suppressed by steroids, alkylating agents, antimetabolites,
or radiation.
BCG vaccine should be administered with caution to persons in groups at high risk for HIV infection.
An AIDS patient was reported to have developed disseminated M. bovis disease after vaccination with
4


## p. 5 (#311) ##############################################

BCG (43). Three infants with symptomatic HIV infection were reported to have developed BCG adenitis
after vaccination (44); however, disseminated BCG disease has not been reported in persons with
asymptomatic HIV infection.
Theoretically, persons with asymptomatic HIV infection may be at greater risk for complications
from BCG vaccine, but data are inconclusive regarding this elevated risk. The World Health Organiza-
tion has recommended that in populations where the risk of tuberculosis is high, HIV-infected children
who are asymptomatic should receive BCG vaccine at birth or as soon as possible thereafter. BCG
vaccine should not be given to children with symptomatic HIV infection (45). In populations where the
risk of TB is low, BCG vaccine should be withheld from persons known or suspected to be infected with
HIV (45). The latter recommendation would apply to most populations in the United States for whom
BCG might be considered.
Use in Pregnancy
Although harmful effects of BCG on the fetus have not been observed, women should avoid
vaccination during pregnancy.
SURVEILLANCE
All suspected adverse reactions to BCG should be reported to the manufacturer and to the Office of
Biologics Research, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration,
Bethesda, Maryland. These reactions occasionally occur > 1 year after vaccination.

Cholera Vaccine
INTRODUCTION
Historically, endemic and epidemic cholera commonly has occurred in parts of southern and
southeastern Asia. Since 1961, cholera caused by the El Tor biotype has been epidemic throughout
much of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa and in certain parts of Europe. Infection is acquired primarily
by consuming contaminated water or food; person-to-person transmission is rare. Travelers who
follow the usual tourist itinerary and who use standard accommodations in countries affected by
cholera are at virtually no risk of infection.
CHOLERA VACCINE
Cholera vaccines*, whether prepared from Classic or El Tor strains, are of limited usefulness. In field
trials conducted in areas with endemic cholera, vaccines have been only about 50% effective in
reducing the incidence of clinical illness for 3–6 months. They do not prevent transmission of infection.
Therefore, the Public Health Service no longer requires cholera vaccination for travelers coming to the
United States from cholera-infected areas, and the World Health Organization (WHO) no longer
recommends cholera vaccination for travel to or from cholera-infected areas. Surveillance and
treatment are sufficient to prevent spread of the disease if it were introduced into the United States.
Vaccine available in the United States is prepared from a combination of phenol-inactivated
suspensions of classic Inaba and Ogawa strains of Vibrio cholerae grown on agar or in broth.
VACCINE USAGE
General Recommendations
Vaccine should not be used to manage contacts of persons with imported cases or to control the
spread of infection. Repeated vaccination is required or advised sometimes for laboratory workers and
airline and ship crews. However, such groups are unlikely to acquire or transmit cholera. Because
information on the long-term safety of repeated vaccination is limited, such practices should be
discontinued for airline and ship crews except when resolutely demanded by some countries for
international travel.
Vaccine is not recommended for infants <6 months of age and is not required for travel by most
countries.
Vaccination for International Travel
The risk of cholera to U.S. travelers is so low that the vaccine is not likely to benefit most U.S.
travelers. Persons using standard tourist accomodations in countries affected by cholera are at
virtually no risk of infection. The traveler's best protection against cholera, as well as against many
other enteric diseases, is to avoid food and water that might be contaminated.
However, many countries affected or threatened by cholera require evidence of cholera vaccination
for entry. One dose of vaccine will usually satisfy entry requirements for persons who anticipate travel
to such countries and who will be vaccinated in the United States.
With the threat or occurrence of epidemic cholera, health authorities of some countries may require
evidence of a complete primary series of two doses or a booster dose within 6 months before arrival.
The complete primary series is otherwise suggested only for special high-risk groups that work and
live in highly endemic areas under less than sanitary conditions (Table 1).
Vaccination requirements published by WHO are regularly updated and summarized for travelers by
the Public Health Service and distributed to state and local health departments, airlines, travel agents,
many physicians, and others. Physicians and travelers should seek information on requirements from
these sources.
*Official name: Cholera Vaccine.

## p. 8 (#314) ##############################################

Physicians administering vaccine to travelers should emphasize that an International Certificate of
Vaccination against cholera must be validated for it to be acceptable to quarantine authorities.
Validation can be obtained at most city, county, and state health departments as well as many private
clinics and physicians' offices. Failure to secure validation may cause travelers to be revaccinated or
quarantined. A properly documented certificate is valid for 6 months, beginning 6 days after
vaccination or beginning on the date of revaccination if this revaccination is within 6 months of a
previous injection.
Data have indicated that persons given yellow fever and cholera vaccines simultaneously or 1-3
weeks apart had initially lower-titered antibody responses to both vaccines. However, seroconversion
rates were unaffected, and the clinical importance of these data are unknown. In view of these data,
yellow fever and cholera vaccines ideally should be given at least 3 weeks apart. If that is not possible,
and both vaccines must be given, then they can be given simultaneously or at any time within the
3-week interval, although a delay in expected yellow fever protection may occur.
Primary Immunization
Complete primary immunization consists of two doses of vaccine given at least 1 week apart. The
intradermal route is satisfactory for persons >5 years of age (Table 1).
Booster Doses
Booster doses may be given every 6 months if necessary for travel or for residence in highly
endemic, unsanitary areas. In areas where cholera occurs in a 2–3 month season, protection is best if
the booster dose is given at the beginning of the season. The primary series does not need to be
repeated for booster doses to be effective.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
Reactions
Vaccination often results in 1-2 days of pain, erythema, and induration at the site of injection. The
local reaction may be accompanied by fever, malaise, and headache.
Serious reactions following cholera vaccination are extremely rare. If a person has had a serious
reaction to the vaccine, revaccination is not advised. Most governments will permit an unvaccinated
traveler to proceed if he/she carries a physician's statement of medical contraindication. However,
some countries may quarantine such unvaccinated persons or place them under surveillance if they
come from areas with cholera.
Pregnancy
No specific information exists on the safety of cholera vaccine during pregnancy. Its use should be
individualized to reflect actual need.

Recommendations of the
Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
These revised recommendations on vaccinia (smallpox) vaccine update the
previous recommendations ( MMWR 1985;34:341-2) and include current infor-
mation on its use among laboratory and health-care workers occupationally
exposed to vaccinia, recombinant vaccinia viruses, and other orthopoxviruses
that can infect humans. This report also contains revised recommendations on
revaccination of high-risk workers and information on contraindications to
vaccination.
INTRODUCTION
Vaccinia (smallpox) vaccine is a highly effective immunizing agent that brought
about the global eradication of smallpox. The last naturally occurring case of
smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977. In May 1980, the World Health Assembly
certified that the world was free of naturally occurring smallpox ( 1 ).
Because of vaccination programs and quarantine regulations, the risk of importa-
tion of smallpox into the United States was reduced by the 1960s. As a result, routine
vaccinia vaccination was discontinued in 1971 (2). In 1976, the recommendation for
routine vaccination of health-care workers was also discontinued (3). In 1982, the
only active licensed producer of vaccinia vaccine in the United States discontinued
production for general use, and in 1983, distribution to the civilian population was
discontinued (4). For several years all military personnel continued to be routinely
vaccinated. However, only selected groups of military personnel are currently
vaccinated against smallpox.
Since January 1982, smallpox vaccination has not been required for international
travelers, and International Certificates of Vaccination no longer include smallpox
vaccination (5).
In 1980, the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommended the
use of vaccinia vaccine to protect laboratory workers from possible infection while
working with nonvariola orthopoxviruses (e.g., vaccinia and monkeypox) (6). In
1984, these recommendations were included in guidelines for biosafety in microbio-
logical and biomedical laboratories (7). These guidelines expanded the recommen-
dation to include persons working in animal-care areas where studies with orthopox-
viruses were being conducted and recommended that these workers have
documented evidence of satisfactory smallpox vaccination within the preceding 3
years. CDC has provided vaccinia vaccine for these laboratory workers since 1983 (8).

Because studies of recombinant vaccinia virus vaccines have been advanced to the
stage of clinical trials, health-care workers (e.g., physicians and nurses) may now be
exposed to vaccinia and recombinant vaccinia viruses and should be considered for
vaccinia vaccination.
VACCINIA VACCINE
The vaccinia vaccine currently licensed in the United States is a lyophilized
preparation of infectious vaccinia virus.* The vaccine was prepared from calf lymph
with a seed virus derived from the New York City Board of Health (NYCBOH) strain of
vaccinia; it has a concentration of 108 pock-forming units (PFU) per milliliter. Vaccine
is administered by using the multiple-puncture technique with a bifurcated needle.
After percutaneous administration of a standard dose of vaccinia vaccine, >95% of
primary vaccinees (i.e., persons receiving their first dose of vaccine) will develop
neutralizing or hemagglutination inhibition antibody at a titer of 21:10 (9). Neutral-
izing antibody titers of 1:10 are found among 75% of persons for 10 years after
receiving second doses and up to 30 years after receiving three doses of vaccine
(10,11 ). The level of antibody that protects against smallpox (variola) infection is not
known, but epidemiologic studies suggest that protection against smallpox persists a
minimum of 5 years after revaccination (12). Also, the level of antibody required for
protection against vaccinia infection is not known. However, when the response to
revaccination is used as an indication of immunity, <10% of persons with neutralizing
titers of 21:10 exhibit a primary-type response at revaccination, compared with
>30% of persons with titers <1:10 (13).
RECOMBINANT VACCINIA VIRUSES
Vaccinia virus is the prototype of the genus Orthopoxvirus. It is a double-stranded
DNA virus that has a broad host range under experimental conditions and is rarely
isolated from animals outside the laboratory (14). There are many strains of vaccinia
virus, which have different levels of virulence for humans and animals. For example,
the Temple of Heaven and Copenhagen vaccinia strains are highly pathogenic in
animals, whereas the NYCBOH strain, from which the Wyeth vaccine strain was
derived, had relatively low pathogenicity (15).
Vaccinia virus can be genetically engineered to contain and express foreign DNA
without impairing the ability of the virus to replicate. Such foreign DNA can encode
protein antigens that induce protection against one or more infectious agents.
Recombinant vaccinia viruses have been engineered to express the immunizing
antigens of herpesvirus, hepatitis B, rabies, influenza, human immunodeficiency
viruses (HIV), and others (16-21 ).
Recombinant vaccinia viruses have been created from several strains of vaccinia
virus. In the United States most recombinants have been made from either the
NYCBOH strain or a mouse neuroadapted derivative, the WR strain. Some recombi-

nants have been made from the Copenhagen and Lister vaccinia strains, which are
more pathogenic in animals than the NYCBOH strain. Animal studies generally
suggest that recombinants may be no more pathogenic than the parent strain of
vaccinia virus. However, no consistently reliable laboratory marker or animal test
predicts the attenuation of vaccinia virus or a particular recombinant for humans (22).
Laboratory-acquired infections with vaccinia or recombinant viruses have been
reported (23–25). However, since no surveillance system has been established to
monitor laboratory workers, the risk of infection for persons who handle virus
cultures or materials contaminated with these viruses is not known.
With the initiation of human trials of recombinant vaccines, physicians, nurses,
and other health-care personnel who provide clinical care to recipients of these
vaccines could be exposed to both vaccinia and recombinant viruses. This exposure
could occur from contact with dressings contaminated with the virus or through
exposure to the vaccine. The risk of transmission of recombinant viruses to exposed
health-care workers is unknown. To date, no reports of transmission to health-care
personnel from vaccine recipients have been published. If appropriate infection-
control precautions are observed, health-care workers are probably at less risk of
infection than laboratory workers because of the smaller volume and lower titer of
virus in clinical specimens compared with laboratory material (26,27). However,
because of the potential for transmission of vaccinia or recombinant vaccinia viruses
to such persons, the ACIP suggests that health-care personnel who have direct
contact with contaminated dressings or other infectious material from volunteers in
clinical studies be considered for vaccination.
Laboratory and other health-care personnel who work with viral cultures or other
infective materials should always observe appropriate biosafety guidelines and
adhere to published infection control procedures (26–28).
VACCINE USAGE
Vaccinia vaccine is recommended for laboratory workers who directly handle a)
cultures or b) animals contaminated or infected with vaccinia, recombinant vaccinia
viruses, or other orthopoxviruses that infect humans (e.g., monkeypox, cowpox).
Other health-care workers (such as physicians and nurses) whose contact with these
viruses is limited to contaminated materials (e.g., dressings) but who adhere to
appropriate infection control measures are at lower risk of inadvertent infection
than laboratory workers. However, because a theoretical risk of infection exists,
vaccination may be considered for this group. Because of the low risk of infection,
vaccination is not recommended for persons who do not directly handle virus
cultures or materials or who do not work with animals contaminated or infected with
these viruses.
High seroconversion rates and infrequent adverse events (see Side Effects and
Adverse Reactions) are two benefits of vaccination. Recipients are given controlled
percutaneous doses (approximately 2.5X105 PFU (29)) of relatively low pathogenicity
vaccinia. The resulting immunity should provide some degree of protection to
recipients against infections resulting from uncontrolled, inadvertent inoculation by
unusual routes (e.g., the eye) with a large dose of virus of higher or unknown
pathogenicity. In addition, persons with preexisting immunity to vaccinia may be
protected against seroconversion to the foreign antigen expressed by a recombinant
virus (20).

Revaccination
According to available data on the persistence of neutralizing antibody following
vaccination, persons working with vaccinia, recombinant vaccinia viruses, or other
nonvariola orthopoxviruses should be revaccinated every 10 years.
SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE REACTIONS
Vaccine recipients
A papule develops at the site of vaccination 2–5 days after percutaneous admin-
istration of vaccinia vaccine to a non-immune person (i.e., primary vaccination). The
papule becomes vesicular, then pustular, and reaches its maximum size in 8–10 days.
The pustule dries and forms a scab, which separates within 14–21 days after
vaccination, leaving a typical scar. Primary vaccination can produce swelling and
tenderness of regional lymph nodes, beginning 3–10 days after vaccination and
persisting for 2-4 weeks after the skin lesion has healed. Maximum viral shedding
occurs 4-14 days following vaccination, but vaccinia can be recovered from the site
of vaccination until the scab separates from the skin (30,31 ).
A fever is common after the vaccinia vaccination is administered. Up to 70% of
children have 1 or more days of temperature of 2100 F from 4 to 14 days after primary
vaccination (9), and 15%-20% have temperatures of >102 F. After revaccination, 35%
of children develop temperatures of >100 F, and 5% have temperatures of >102 F
(13). Fever is less common in adults than children after vaccination or revaccination
(31; CDC, unpublished data).
Erythematous or urticarial rashes may occur approximately 10 days after primary
vaccination. The vaccinee is usually afebrile, and the rash resolves spontaneously
within 2 to 4 days. Rarely bullous erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
occurs (32).
Inadvertent inoculation at other sites is the most frequent complication of vaccinia
vaccination, accounting for about half of all complications of primary vaccination and
revaccination (Table 1). Inadvertent inoculation usually results from auto-inoculation
of vaccine virus transferred from the site of vaccination. The most common sites
involved are the face, eyelid, nose, mouth, genitalia, and rectum. Most lesions heal
without specific therapy, but vaccinia immune globulin (VIG) may be useful for cases
of ocular implantation (see Treatment of Complications of Vaccinia Vaccine).
Generalized vaccinia among persons without underlying illnesses is characterized
by a vesicular rash of varying extent. The rash is generally self limited and requires
little or no therapy except among patients whose conditions appear to be toxic or who
have serious underlying illnesses.
More severe complications of vaccinia vaccination include eczema vaccinatum,
progressive vaccinia, and postvaccinial encephalitis. These complications occur at
least 10 times more often among primary vaccinees than among revaccinees and
more frequently among infants than among older children and adults (33–35)
(Table 1).
Eczema vaccinatum is a localized or systemic dissemination of vaccinia virus
among persons who have eczema or a history of eczema and other chronic or

exfoliative skin conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis). The illness is usually mild and self
limited, but may be severe and occasionally fatal. The most serious cases among
vaccine recipients occur among primary vaccinees and appear to be independent of
the activity of the underlying eczema (36). Severe cases have also been observed
after contact infection (see Contacts of vaccinees).
Progressive vaccinia (vaccinia necrosum) is a severe, potentially fatal illness
characterized by progressive necrosis in the area of vaccination, often with metastatic
lesions. It occurs almost exclusively among persons with cellular immunodeficiency.
The most serious complication is postvaccinial encephalitis. Most frequently it
affects primary vaccinees <1 year of age. From 15% to 25% of affected vaccinees with
this complication die, and 25% have permanent neurologic sequelae (32–34).
Death is rare after vaccinia vaccination, with approximately 1 to 2 deaths per
million primary vaccinations and 0.1 death per million revaccinations. Death is most
often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or progressive vaccinia.
Contacts of vaccinees
Transmission of vaccinia may occur when a recently vaccinated person has contact
with a susceptible person. In the CDC 10-state survey of complications of smallpox
vaccination, the risk of transmission to contacts was 27 infections per million total
vaccinations; 44% of these contact cases occurred among children 55 years of age
(33). Since 1980, several occurrences of contact transmission of vaccinia from
recently vaccinated military recruits have been reported, including six cases trans-
mitted by a single vaccine recipient (37–39).
Over 60% of contact transmission results in uncomplicated inadvertent inocula-
tion. Approximately 30% of contact transmission results in eczema vaccinatum, which
may be fatal (33). Eczema vaccinatum may be more severe among contacts than

among vaccinated persons, possibly because of simultaneous multiple inoculations
at several sites (34,40 ). Contact transmission rarely results in postvaccinial enceph-
alitis or vaccinia necrosum.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
Before administering vaccinia vaccine, the physician should take a careful history
to document the absence of contraindications to vaccination among both vaccinees
and household contacts of vaccinees. Special efforts should be made to identify
vaccinees and household contacts who have eczema, a history of eczema, or
immunodeficiencies. Vaccinia vaccine should not be administered if these conditions
are present among either recipients or household contacts.
History or presence of eczema
Because of the increased risk of eczema vaccinatum, vaccinia vaccine should not
be administered to persons with eczema or a past history of eczema or to those
whose household contacts have eczema. Persons with other acute, chronic, or
exfoliative skin conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis, burns, impetigo, or varicella zoster)
may also be at higher risk of eczema vaccinatum and should not be vaccinated until
the condition resolves.
Pregnancy
Vaccinia vaccine should not be administered to pregnant women. On rare occa-
sions, almost always after primary vaccination, vaccinia virus has been reported to
cause fetal infection (41 ). Fewer than 50 cases of fetal vaccinia are known, but cases
have been observed as recently as 1978 (35,42). Fetal vaccinia usually results in
stillbirth or death of the infant shortly after delivery. Vaccinia vaccine is not known to
cause congenital malformations.
Altered immunocompetence
Replication of vaccinia virus can be enhanced among persons with immune
deficiency diseases and among those with immunosuppression (as occurs with
leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, agammaglobulinemia, or therapy
with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, or large doses of corticosteroids).
Persons with such conditions or therapies or whose household contacts have such
conditions should not be administered vaccinia vaccine.
Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
The risk of severe complications after vaccinia vaccination for persons infected
with HIV is not known. At least one case of severe generalized vaccinia has been
reported in an asymptomatic HIV-infected military recruit after the administration of
multiple vaccines, including vaccinia (43). In addition, a recent report suggests that
two HIV-infected persons may have died of a progressive vaccinia-like illness after
treatment with inactivated autologous lymphocytes infected with a recombinant
HIV-vaccinia virus (44). However, at present there is no evidence that smallpox

vaccination accelerates the progression of HIV-related disease. Nevertheless, until
additional information becomes available, it is prudent not to vaccinate persons who
have HIV infection.
Allergies
Vaccinia vaccine contains trace amounts of polymyxin B sulfate, streptomycin
sulfate, chlortetracycline hydrochloride, and neomycin sulfate. Persons who experi-
ence anaphylactic reactions (hives, swelling of the mouth and throat, difficulty
breathing, hypotension, and shock) to any of these antibiotics should not be
vaccinated. Vaccinia vaccine does not contain penicillin.
PREVENTION OF CONTACT TRANSMISSION OF VACCINIA
Vaccinia virus may be cultured from the site of primary vaccination beginning at
the time of development of a papule (2–5 days after vaccination) until the scab
separates from the skin lesion (14–21 days after vaccination). During this time, care
must be taken to prevent spread of the virus to another area of the body or to another
person. The vaccination site should be covered at all times with a porous bandage
until the scab has separated and the underlying skin has healed. An occlusive
bandage should not be used. The vaccination site should be kept dry. When the
vaccinee bathes, the site should be covered with an impermeable bandage.
Vaccinated health-care workers may continue to have contact with patients,
including those with immunodeficiencies, as long as the vaccination site is covered
and good hand-washing technique is maintained.
Semipermeable polyurethane dressings (e.g., OpsiteR) are effective barriers to
vaccinia and recombinant vaccinia viruses (21). However, exudate may accumulate
beneath the dressing, and care must be taken to prevent viral contamination when the
dressing is removed. In addition, accumulation of fluid beneath the dressing may
increase the maceration of the vaccination site. Accumulation of exudate may be
decreased by first covering the vaccination with dry gauze, then applying the dressing
over the gauze. To date, experience with this type of containment dressing has been
limited to research protocols, and further investigation is needed before it can be
recommended for all vaccinia vaccine recipients.
The most important measure to prevent inadvertent implantation and contact
transmission from vaccinia vaccination is thorough hand washing after changing the
bandage or after any other contact with the vaccination site.
TREATMENT OF COMPLICATIONS OF VACCINIA VACCINE
The only product currently available for the treatment of complications of vaccinia
vaccination is vaccinia immune globulin (VIG). VIG is an isotonic sterile solution of the
immunoglobulin fraction of plasma from persons vaccinated with vaccinia vaccine. It
is effective for the treatment of eczema vaccinatum and some cases of progressive
vaccinia and may be useful in the treatment of ocular vaccinia resulting from

inadvertent implantation. VIG is also recommended for severe generalized vaccinia if
the patient has a toxic condition or a serious underlying disease. VIG is of no benefit
in the treatment of postvaccinial encephalitis.
The recommended dosage for treatment of complications is 0.6 ml/kg of body
weight. VIG must be administered intramuscularly and should be administered as
early as possible after the onset of symptoms. Because therapeutic doses of VIG may
be large (e.g., 42 mL for a person weighing 70 kg), the product should be given in
divided doses over a 24- to 36-hour period. Doses may be repeated, usually at
intervals of 2–3 days, until recovery begins (e.g., no new lesions appear).
CDC is the only source of VIG for civilians.
MISUSE OF VACCINIA VACCINE
Vaccinia vaccine should never be used therapeutically for any reason. There is no
evidence that it has any value in the treatment or prevention of recurrent herpes
simplex infection, warts, or any disease other than those caused by human orthopox-
viruses (45). Misuse of vaccinia vaccine to treat herpes infections has been associ-
ated with severe complications (46-47).
VACCINIA VACCINE AVAILABILITY
CDC is the only source of vaccinia vaccine and VIG for civilians. CDC will provide
vaccinia vaccine to protect laboratory and other health-care personnel whose occu-
pations place them at risk of exposure to vaccinia and other closely related orthopox-
viruses, including vaccinia recombinants. The vaccine should be administered under
the supervision of a physician selected by the institution. Vaccine will be shipped to
the responsible physician. Requests for vaccine and VIG, including the reason for the
request, should be referred to:

Yellow Fever Vaccine
Recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
These revised Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommendations on
yellow fever vaccine update previous recommendations (MMWR 1984;32:679-88). Changes
have been made to clarify 1) the risks of acquiring yellow fever associated with travel to
endemic areas, 2) the precautions necessary for vaccination of special groups (immunosup-
pressed individuals, infants, pregnant women), and 3) simultaneous administration of cholera
vaccine and other vaccines.
INTRODUCTION
Yellow fever presently occurs only in Africa and South America. Two forms of yellow fever- urban
and jungle-are epidemiologically distinguishable. Clinically and etiologically they are identical (1,2).
Urban yellow fever is an epidemic viral disease of humans transmitted from infected to susceptible
persons by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which breed in domestic and peridomestic containers (e.g.,
water jars, barrels, drums, tires, tin cans) and thus in close association with humans. In areas where Ae.
aegypti has been eliminated or suppressed, urban yellow fever has disappeared. In the early 1900s,
eradication of Ae. aegypti in a number of countries, notably Panama, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia,
Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina, led to the disappearance of urban yellow fever. The last
documented Ae. aegypti-borne yellow fever epidemic in the western hemisphere occurred in Trinidad
in 1954. Ae. aegypti is suspected to have played a role in transmission in outbreaks occurring in Bolivia
in 1989 and 1990, but that role was not proven. However, periodic reinfestations of some countries
have occurred in recent years (Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Panama). Other countries remain infested,
including areas of Venezuela, Colombia, and the Guyanas, which include enzootic areas for jungle
yellow fever. In West Africa, Ae. aegypti-transmitted epidemics continue to occur and involve human
populations both in towns and in rural villages (3).
Jungle yellow fever is an enzootic viral disease transmitted among nonhuman primate hosts by
various mosquito vectors. It is currently observed only in forest-savannah zones of tropical Africa and
in forested areas of South America but occasionally extends into parts of Central America and the
island of Trinidad. In South America, approximately 100-300 cases are reported annually, mainly
among men with occupational exposures in forested areas; however, the disease is believed to be
greatly underreported. In Africa, epidemics involving tree-hole-breeding mosquito vectors affect tens
of thousands of persons at intervals of a few years, but few cases are officially reported. Sometimes
the disease is not detected in an area for years but then will reappear. Delineation of affected areas
depends on surveillance of animal reservoirs and vectors, accurate diagnosis, and prompt reporting of
all human cases. The jungle yellow fever cycle may be active but unrecognized in forested areas of
countries within the yellow fever endemic zone (Figure 1).
Urban yellow fever can be prevented by eradicating Ae. aegypti mosquitoes or by suppressing their
numbers to the point that they no longer perpetuate infection. Jungle yellow fever can most effectively
be prevented by vaccination of human populations at risk of exposure.
YELLOW FEVER VACCINE
Yellow fever vaccine is a live, attenuated virus preparation made from the 17D yellow fever virus
strain (4). The 17D vaccine is safe and effective (5). The virus is grown in chick embryos inoculated
with a seed virus of a fixed-passage level. The vaccine is a freeze-dried supernate of centrifuged
embryo homogenate, packaged in 1-dose and 5-dose vials for domestic use.
Vaccine should be stored at temperatures between 5 C (41 F) and -30 C (-22 F) – preferably frozen,
below 0 C (32 F) - until it is reconstituted by the addition of diluent sterile, physiologic saline supplied
by the manufacturer. Multiple-dose vials of reconstituted vaccine should be held at 5 C-10 C (41 F-50
F); unused vaccine should be discarded within 1 hour after reconstitution.

VACCINE USAGE
A. Persons living or traveling in endemic areas
1. Persons >9 months of age traveling to or living in areas of South America and Africa where
yellow fever infection is officially reported should be vaccinated. These areas are listed in the
“Bi-Weekly Summary of Countries with Areas Infected with Quarantinable Diseases," available in
state and local health departments. Information on known or probably infected areas is also
available from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Pan American Health Organization
offices or the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC,
Fort Collins, Colorado, telephone (303) 221-6400.
Vaccination is also recommended for travel outside the urban areas of countries that do not
officially report the disease but that lie in the yellow fever endemic zone (shaded area, Figure 1).
The actual areas of yellow fever virus activity far exceed the infected zones officially reported; in
recent years, fatal cases of yellow fever have occurred among unvaccinated tourists visiting rural
areas within the yellow fever endemic zone (6).
2. Infants <9 months of age and pregnant women should be considered for vaccination if traveling
to areas experiencing ongoing epidemic yellow fever when travel cannot be postponed and a
high level of prevention against mosquito exposure is not feasible. However, in no instance
should infants <4 months of age receive yellow fever vaccine because of the risk of encephalitis
(see Precautions and Contraindications).
3. Laboratory personnel who might be exposed to virulent yellow fever virus by direct or indirect
contact or by aerosols should also be vaccinated.
B. Vaccination for international travel. For purposes of international travel, yellow fever vaccines
produced by different manufacturers worldwide must be approved by WHO and administered at an
approved Yellow Fever Vaccination Center. State and territorial health departments have the
authority to designate nonfederal vaccination centers; these can be identified by contacting state or
local health departments. Vaccinees should receive an International Certificate of Vaccination
completed, signed, and validated with the center's stamp where the vaccine is given.
Vaccination for international travel may be required under circumstances other than those
specified herein. Some countries in Africa require evidence of vaccination from all entering
travelers. Some countries may waive the requirements for travelers coming from noninfected areas
and staying <2 weeks. Because requirements may change, all travelers should seek current
information from health departments. Travel agencies, international airlines, and/or shipping lines
should also have up-to-date information.
2


## p. 3 (#335) ##############################################

Some countries require an individual, even if only in transit, to have a valid International
Certificate of Vaccination if s/he has been in countries either known or thought to harbor
yellow fever virus. Such requirements may be strictly enforced, particularly for persons
traveling from Africa or South America to Asia. Travelers should consult Health Information
for International Travel 1989 (7) to determine requirements and regulations for vaccination.
C. Primary vaccination. For persons of all ages, a single subcutaneous injection of 0.5 ml of
reconstituted vaccine is used.
D. Booster doses. The International Health Regulations require revaccination at intervals of 10 years.
Revaccination boosts antibody titer; however, evidence from several studies (8-10) suggests that
yellow fever vaccine immunity persists for at least 30-35 years and probably for life.
REACTIONS
Reactions to 17D yellow fever vaccine are generally mild. After vaccination, 2%-5% of vaccinees
have mild headaches, myalgia, low-grade fevers, or other minor symptoms for 5-10 days. Fewer than
0.2% of the vaccinees curtail regular activities. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, characterized by
rash, urticaria, and/or asthma, are uncommon (incidence <1/1,000,000) and occur principally among
persons with histories of egg allergy. Although >34 million doses of vaccine have been distributed,
only two cases of encephalitis temporally associated with vaccinations have been reported in the
United States; in one fatal case, 17D virus was isolated from the brain.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
A. Age. Infants <4 months of age are more susceptible to serious adverse reactions (encephalitis) than
older children. The risk of this complication appears to be age-related; whenever possible,
vaccination should be delayed until age 9 months.
B. Pregnancy. Although specific information is not available concerning adverse effects of yellow fever
vaccine on the developing fetus, pregnant women theoretically should not be vaccinated, and travel
to areas where yellow fever is present should be postponed until after delivery. If international
travel requirements constitute the only reason to vaccinate a pregnant woman, rather than an
increased risk of infection, efforts should be made to obtain a waiver letter from the traveler's
physician (see section D. Hypersensitivity). Pregnant women who must travel to areas where the
risk of yellow fever is high should be vaccinated. Under these circumstances, for both mother and
fetus, the small theoretical risk from vaccination is far outweighed by the risk of yellow fever
infection.
C. Altered immune states. Infection with yellow fever vaccine virus poses a theoretical risk of
encephalitis to patients with immunosuppression in association with acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) or other manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,
leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or to those whose immunologic responses are
suppressed by corticosteroids, alkylating drugs, antimetabolites, or radiation. Such patients should
not be vaccinated. If travel to a yellow fever-infected zone is necessary, patients should be advised
of the risk, instructed in methods for avoiding vector mosquitoes, and supplied with vaccination
waiver letters by their physicians.
Low-dose (10 mg prednisone or equivalent) or short-term (<2 weeks) corticosteroid therapy or
intra-articular, bursal, or tendon injections with corticosteroids should not be immunosuppressive
and constitute no increased hazard to recipients of yellow fever vaccine. Persons who have had
previously diagnosed asymptomatic HIV infections and who cannot avoid potential exposure to
yellow fever virus should be offered the choice of vaccination. Vaccinees should be monitored for
possible adverse effects. Since the vaccination of such persons may be less effective than that for
non-HIV-infected persons, their neutralizing antibody response to vaccination may be desired
before travel. For such determinations, the appropriate state health department or CDC ([303]
221-6400) may be contacted. Family members of immunosuppressed persons, who themselves
have no contraindications, may receive yellow fever vaccine.
-

## p. 4 (#336) ##############################################

D. Hypersensitivity. Live yellow fever vaccine is produced in chick embryos and should not be given
to persons hypersensitive to eggs; generally, persons who are able to eat eggs or egg products
may receive the vaccine.
If international travel regulations are the only reason to vaccinate a patient hypersensitive to
eggs, efforts should be made to obtain a waiver. A physician's letter stating the contraindication
to vaccination has been acceptable to some governments. (Ideally, it should be written on
letterhead stationary and bear the stamp used by health department and official immunization
centers to validate the International Certificate of Vaccination.) Under these conditions, the
traveler should also obtain specific and authoritative advice from the embassy or consulate of
the country or countries s/he plans to visit. Waivers of requirements obtained from embassies or
consulates should be documented by appropriate letters and retained for presentation with the
International Health Certificate.
If vaccination of an individual with a questionable history of egg hypersensitivity is considered
essential because of a high risk of exposure, an intradermal test dose may be administered
under close medical supervision. Specific directions for skin testing are found in the package
insert.
SIMULTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF OTHER VACCINES
Determination of whether to administer yellow fever vaccine and other immunobiologics simulta-
neously should be made on the basis of convenience to the traveler in completing the desired
vaccinations before travel and on information regarding possible interference. The following will help
guide these decisions.
Studies have shown that the serologic response to yellow fever vaccine is not inhibited by the
administration of certain other vaccines concurrently or at various intervals of a few days to 1 month.
Measles and yellow fever vaccines have been administered in combination with full efficacy of each of
the components; Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) and yellow fever vaccines have been administered
simultaneously without interference. Additionally, severity of reactions to vaccination has not been
amplified by the concurrent administration of yellow fever and other live virus vaccines (11). If live
virus vaccines are not given concurrently, 4 weeks should elapse between sequential vaccinations.
Some data have indicated that persons given yellow fever and cholera vaccines simultaneously or
1-3 weeks apart had lower than normal antibody responses to both vaccines (12,13). Unless there are
time constraints, cholera and yellow fever vaccines should be administered at a minimal interval of 3
weeks. If the vaccines cannot be administered at least 3 weeks apart, the vaccines can be given
simultaneously or at any time within the 3-week interval.
Hepatitis B and yellow fever vaccine may be given concurrently (14). No data exist on possible
interference between yellow fever and typhoid, paratyphoid, typhus, plague, rabies, or Japanese
encephalitis vaccines.
In a prospective study of persons given yellow fever vaccine and 5 cc of commercially available
immune globulin, no alteration of the immunologic response to yellow fever vaccine was detected
when compared with controls (15). Although chloroquine inhibits replication of yellow fever virus in
vitro, it does not adversely affect antibody responses to yellow fever vaccine in humans receiving
antimalaria prophylaxis ( 16 ).

Typhoid Immunization
Recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
These revised recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee update
previous recommendations (
MMWR 1978;27:231-3). They include information on a newly
licensed oral live-attenuated typhoid vaccine that was not available when previous recommen-
dations were published.
INTRODUCTION
The incidence of typhoid fever declined steadily in the United States from 1900 to 1960 and has since
remained at a low level. From 1975 through 1984, the average number of cases reported annually was
464. During that period, >50% of cases occurred among patients >20 years of age; 62% of reported
cases occurred among persons who had traveled to other countries, compared with 33% of reported
cases from 1967 through 1976.
TYPHOID AND PARATYPHOID A AND B VACCINES
Two vaccines are generally available for civilian use in the United States: 1) a newly licensed oral
live-attenuated vaccine (Vivotif, manufactured from the Ty21a strain of Salmonella typhi by the Swiss
Serum and Vaccine Institute) and 2) a parenteral heat-phenol-inactivated vaccine (manufactured by
Wyeth) that has been widely used for many years. In controlled field trials conducted among Chilean
schoolchildren, three doses of the Ty21a vaccine were shown to reduce laboratory-confirmed infection
by 67% for at least 4 years (95% confidence interval 47%-79%). In a subsequent trial, a statistically
significant decrease in the incidence of clinical typhoid fever occurred among persons receiving four
doses of vaccine compared with two or three doses. Since no placebo group was included in this trial,
vaccine efficacy could not be calculated. The mechanism by which Ty21a vaccine confers protection is
unknown; however, the vaccine does elicit a humoral response. Secondary transmission of vaccine
organisms does not occur because viable organisms are not shed in the stool of vaccinees.
In two field trials involving a primary series of two doses of heat-phenol-inactivated typhoid vaccine,
similar to the currently available parenteral vaccine, vaccine efficacy ranged from 51%-76%. Vaccine
efficacy for an acetone-inactivated parenteral vaccine, available only to the armed forces, ranges from
66%-94%.
Parenteral heat-phenol-inactivated vaccine and oral live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine have never been
directly compared in a field trial, but the live-attenuated vaccine has similar efficacy to the heat-
phenol-inactivated vaccine and results in fewer adverse reactions. Experience is limited with the use of
the Ty21a vaccine for persons from areas without endemic disease who travel to endemic-disease
regions, and for children <5 years of age. Also, no experience has been reported regarding its use for
persons previously vaccinated with parenteral vaccine.
Vaccines against paratyphoid A and B are not licensed for use in the United States. The effectiveness
of paratyphoid A vaccine has never been established, and field trials have shown that the small amount
of paratyphoid B antigens contained in “TAB” vaccines (vaccines combining typhoid and paratyphoid
A and B antigens) is not effective. Combining paratyphoid A and B antigens with typhoid vaccine
increases the risk of vaccine reaction. For these reasons, only monovalent preparations of typhoid
vaccine containing S. typhi antigens should be used.
VACCINE USAGE
Routine typhoid vaccination is no longer recommended in the United States. However, selective
vaccination is indicated for the following groups:


## p. 10 (#342) #############################################

Travelers to areas that have a recognized risk of exposure to S. typhi. Risk is greatest for travelers
to developing countries (especially Latin America, Asia, and Africa) who have prolonged exposure
to potentially contaminated food and drink. Such travelers need to be cautioned that typhoid
vaccination is not a substitute for careful selection of food and drink, since typhoid vaccines are
not 100% effective, and the protection the vaccine offers can be overwhelmed by large inocula of
S. typhi.
• Persons with intimate exposure to a documented typhoid fever carrier, such as occurs with
continued household contact.
• Workers in microbiology laboratories who frequently work with S. typhi.
Routine vaccination of sewage sanitation workers is warranted only in areas with endemic typhoid
fever. No evidence has shown that typhoid vaccine is useful in controlling common-source outbreaks.
Also, the use of typhoid vaccine is not indicated for persons attending rural summer camps or in areas
in which natural disasters, such as floods, have occurred.
Primary Vaccination
The following dosages of typhoid vaccines are recommended, based on the experience in field
trials:
Adults and children >10 years of age
• Oral live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine: one enteric-coated capsule taken on alternate days to a total
of four capsules. Each capsule should be taken with cool liquid no warmer than 37 C,
approximately 1 hour before a meal. The capsules must be kept refrigerated, and all four doses
must be taken to achieve maximum efficacy.
Or
• Parenteral inactivated vaccine: 0.5 ml subcutaneously, given on two occasions, separated by 24
weeks.
Children <10 years of age
• Oral live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine*: one enteric-coated capsule taken on alternate days to a total
of four capsules. Each capsule should be taken with cool liquid no warmer than 37 C,
approximately 1 hour before a meal. The capsules must be kept refrigerated, and all four doses
must be taken to achieve maximum efficacy.
Or
• Parenteral inactivated vaccine: 0.25 ml subcutaneously, given on two occasions, separated by 24
weeks.
If parenteral vaccine is used and there is insufficient time for two doses of vaccine separated by 24
weeks, common practice has been to give three doses of the parenteral vaccine in the volumes already
listed at weekly intervals, although this schedule may be less effective.
Booster Doses
Under conditions of continued or repeated exposure to S. typhi, booster doses of vaccine are
required to maintain immunity after vaccination with parenteral typhoid vaccines. If parenteral vaccine
is used, booster doses should be given every 3 years. Even if >3 years have elapsed since the prior
vaccination, a single booster dose of parenteral vaccine is sufficient. When the heat-phenol-inactivated
vaccine is used, less reaction follows booster vaccination by the intradermal route than by the
subcutaneous route. (The acetone-inactivated vaccine should not be given by the intradermal route
because of the potential for severe local reactions.) No experience has been reported using oral
live-attenuated vaccine as a booster; however, using the primary series of four doses of Ty21a as a
booster for persons previously vaccinated with parenteral vaccine is a reasonable alternative to
administration of a parenteral booster dose. The following routes and dosages of parenteral vaccine
for booster vaccination can be expected to produce similar booster antibody responses:
*One study indicates that adverse reactions are uncommon among children 1-5 years of age. Data are unavailable
regarding efficacy for this age group or adverse reactions and efficacy among infants. The vaccine manufacturer
recommends that Ty21a not be given to children <6 years of age.
2.


## p. 11 (#343) #############################################

Adults and children >10 years of age
One dose, 0.5 ml subcutaneously or 0.1 ml intradermally.
Children 6 months to 10 years of age
One dose, 0.25 ml subcutaneously or 0.1 ml intradermally.
The optimal booster schedule for persons who have received Ty21a vaccine has not yet been
determined; however, the longest reported follow-up study of vaccine trial subjects showed continued
efficacy 5 years after vaccination. The manufacturer of Ty21a recommends revaccination with the
entire four-dose series every 5 years. This recommendation may change as more data become
available on the duration of protection produced by the Ty21a vaccine.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
During volunteer studies and field trials with oral live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine in enteric-coated
tablets, side effects were rare and consisted of abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and rash or
urticaria. In safety trials, monitored adverse reactions occurred with equal frequency among groups
receiving vaccine and placebo.
Parenteral inactivated vaccines produce several systemic and local adverse reactions, including
fever (occurring among 14%-29% of vaccinees), headache (9%-30% of vaccinees), and severe local pain
and/or swelling (6%-40% of vaccinees); 13%-24% of vaccinees missed work or school because of
adverse reactions. More severe reactions have been sporadically reported, including hypotension,
chest pain, and shock. Administration of the acetone-inactivated vaccine by jet-injector gun results in
a greater incidence of local reactions and is not recommended.
The only contraindication to parenteral typhoid vaccination is a history of severe local or systemic
reactions following a previous dose. No experience has been reported with parenteral inactivated
vaccine nor oral live-attenuated Ty21a vaccine among pregnant women. Live-attenuated Ty21a should
not be used among immunocompromised persons, including those known to be infected with human
immunodeficiency virus. Parenteral inactivated vaccine presents a theoretically safer alternative for
this group.

Rabies Prevention - United States, 1991
Recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)
These revised recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) on
rabies prevention update the previous recommendations (MMWR 1984;33:393-402,407-8) to reflect the
current status of rabies and antirabies biologics in the United States. *
INTRODUCTION
Following the marked decrease of rabies cases among domestic animals in the United States in the
1940s and 1950s, indigenously acquired rabies among humans decreased to fewer than two cases per
year in the 1960s and 1970s and fewer than one case per year during the 1980s (1). In 1950, for
example, 4,979 cases of rabies were reported among dogs and 18 were reported among human
populations; in 1989, 160 cases were reported among dogs and one was reported among humans.
Thus, the likelihood of human exposure to a rabid domestic animal has decreased greatly; however,
the many possible exposures that result from frequent contact between domestic dogs and humans
continue to be the basis of most antirabies treatments (2).
Rabies among wild animals - especially skunks, raccoons, and bats - has become more prevalent
since the 1950s, accounting for >85% of all reported cases of animal rabies every year since 1976 (1).
Rabies among animals occurs throughout the continental United States; only Hawaii remains
consistently rabies-free. Wild animals now constitute the most important potential source of infection
for both humans and domestic animals in the United States. In much of the rest of the world, including
most of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the dog remains the major species with rabies and the major
source of rabies among humans. Nine of the 13 human rabies deaths reported to CDC from 1980
through 1990 appear to have been related to exposure to rabid animals outside of the United States
(3-9).
Although rabies among humans is rare in the United States, every year approximately 18,000
persons receive rabies preexposure prophylaxis and an additional 10,000 receive postexposure
prophylaxis. Appropriate management of persons possibly exposed to rabies depends on the
interpretation of the risk of infection. Decisions about management must be made immediately. All
available methods of systemic prophylactic treatment are complicated by occasional adverse reac-
tions, but these are rarely severe (10-14).
Data on the efficacy of active and passive rabies immunization have come from both human and
animal studies. Evidence from laboratory and field experience in many areas of the world indicates that
postexposure prophylaxis combining local wound treatment, passive immunization, and vaccination is
uniformly effective when appropriately applied (15-20 ). However, rabies has occasionally developed
among humans when key elements of the rabies postexposure prophylaxis treatment regimens were
omitted or incorrectly administered (see Postexposure Treatment Outside the United States).
RABIES IMMUNIZING PRODUCTS
There are two types of rabies immunizing products.
1) Rabies vaccines induce an active immune response that includes the production of neutralizing
antibodies. This antibody response requires approximately 7-10 days to develop and usually
persists for >2 years.
2) Rabies immune globulins (RIG) provide rapid, passive immune protection that persists for only
a short time (half-life of approximately 21 days) (21,22 ).
In almost all postexposure prophylaxis regimens, both products should be used concurrently.
*For assistance with problems or questions about rabies prophylaxis, contact your local or state health
department. If local or state health department personnel are unavailable, call the Division of Viral and Rickettsial
Diseases, Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC ([404) 639-1075 during working hours or (404) 639-2888 nights,

Vaccines Licensed for Use in the United States
Two inactivated rabies vaccines are currently licensed for preexposure and postexposure prophy-
laxis in the United States.
Rabies Vaccine, Human Diploid Cell (HDCV)
HDCV is prepared from the Pitman-Moore strain of rabies virus grown in MRC-5 human diploid cell
culture and concentrated by ultrafiltration (23). The vaccine is inactivated with betapropiolactone (18)
and is supplied in forms for:
1) Intramuscular (IM) administration, a single-dose vial containing lyophilized vaccine (Pasteur-
Merieux Sérum et Vaccins, Imovax® Rabies, distributed by Connaught Laboratories, Inc., Phone:
800-VACCINE) that is reconstituted in the vial with the accompanying diluent to a final volume of
1.0 ml just before administration.
2) Intradermal (ID) administration, a single-dose syringe containing lyophilized vaccine (Pasteur-
Merieux Sérum et Vaccins, Imovax® Rabies I.D., distributed by Connaught Laboratories, Inc.) that
is reconstituted in the syringe to a volume of 0.1 ml just before administration (24).
A human diploid cell-derived rabies vaccine developed in the United States (Wyeth Laboratories,
Wyvac®) was recalled by the manufacturer from the market in 1985 and is no longer available (25).
Rabies Vaccine, Adsorbed (RVA)
RVA (Michigan Department of Public Health) was licensed on March 19, 1988; it was developed and
is currently distributed by the Biologics Products Program, Michigan Department of Public Health. The
vaccine is prepared from the Kissling strain of Challenge Virus Standard (CVS) rabies virus adapted to
fetal rhesus lung diploid cell culture (26-32 ). The vaccine virus is inactivated with betapropiolactone
and concentrated by adsorption to aluminum phosphate. Because RVA is adsorbed to aluminum
phosphate, it is liquid rather than lyophilized. RVA is currently available only from the Biologics
Products Program, Michigan Department of Public Health. Phone: (517) 335-8050
Both types of rabies vaccines are considered equally efficacious and safe when used as indicated.
The full 1.0-ml dose of either product can be used for both preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis.
Only the Imovax® Rabies I.D. vaccine (HDCV) has been evaluated by the ID dose/route for preexposure
vaccination (33-36); the antibody response and side effects after ID administration of RVA have not
been studied (24). Therefore, RVA should not be used intradermally.
Rabies Immune Globulins Licensed for Use in the United States
HRIG (Cutter Biological (a division of Miles Inc.], Hyperab®; and Pasteur-Merieux Sérum et Vaccins,
Imogam® Rabies, distributed by Connaught Laboratories, Inc.) is an antirabies gamma globulin
concentrated by cold ethanol fractionation from plasma of hyperimmunized human donors. Rabies
neutralizing antibody content, standardized to contain 150 international units (IU) per ml, is supplied in
2-ml (300 IU) and 10-ml (1,500 IU) vials for pediatric and adult use, respectively.
Both HRIG preparations are considered equally efficacious and safe when used as described in this
document.

state public health officials regarding the need for rabies prophylaxis (Table 1). In the United States, the
following factors should be considered before specific antirabies treatment is initiated.
Type of Exposure
Rabies is transmitted only when the virus is introduced into open cuts or wounds in skin or mucous
membranes. If there has been no exposure (as described in this section), postexposure treatment is not
necessary. The likelihood of rabies infection varies with the nature and extent of exposure. Two
categories of exposure (bite and nonbite) should be considered.
Bite
Any penetration of the skin by teeth constitutes a bite exposure. Bites to the face and hands carry
the highest risk, but the site of the bite should not influence the decision to begin treatment (17).
Nonbite
Scratches, abrasions, open wounds, or mucous membranes contaminated with saliva or other
potentially infectious material (such as brain tissue) from a rabid animal constitute nonbite exposures.
If the material containing the virus is dry, the virus can be considered noninfectious.
Other contact by itself, such as petting a rabid animal and contact with the blood, urine, or feces
(e.g., guano) of a rabid animal, does not constitute an exposure and is not an indication for
prophylaxis.
Although occasional reports of transmission by nonbite exposure suggest that such exposures
constitute sufficient reason to initiate postexposure prophylaxis under some circumstances, nonbite
exposures rarely cause rabies (37). The nonbite exposures of highest risk appear to be exposures to
large amounts of aerosolized rabies virus, organs (i.e., corneas) transplanted from patients who died
of rabies, and scratches by rabid animals. Two cases of rabies have been attributed to airborne
exposures in laboratories, and two cases of rabies have been attributed to probable airborne
exposures in a bat-infested cave in Texas (38,39).
The only documented cases of rabies caused by human-to-human transmission occurred among six
recipients of transplanted corneas. Investigations revealed each of the donors had died of an illness
compatible with or proven to be rabies (40-43). The six cases occurred in four countries: Thailand (two
cases), India (two cases), the United States (one case), and France (one case). Stringent guidelines for
acceptance of donor corneas have reduced this risk.
Apart from corneal transplants, bite and nonbite exposures inflicted by infected humans could
theoretically transmit rabies, but no such cases have been documented (44). Adherence to respiratory
precautions will minimize the risk of airborne exposure (45).

Animal Rabies Epidemiology and Evaluation of Involved Species
Wild Animals
Carnivorous wild animals (especially skunks, raccoons, and foxes) and bats are the animals most
often infected with rabies and the cause of most indigenous cases of human rabies in the United States
since 1960 (1). All bites by wild carnivores and bats must be considered possible exposures to the
disease. Postexposure prophylaxis should be initiated when patients are exposed to wild carnivores
unless 1) the exposure occurred in a part of the continental United States known to be free of terrestrial
rabies and the results of immunofluorescence antibody testing will be available within 48 hours or 2)
the animal has already been tested and shown not to be rabid. If treatment has been initiated and
subsequent immunofluorescence testing shows that the exposing animal was not rabid, treatment can
be discontinued.
Signs of rabies among carnivorous wild animals cannot be interpreted reliably; therefore, any such
animal that bites or scratches a person should be killed at once (without unnecessary damage to the
head) and the brain submitted for rabies testing. If the results of testing are negative by immunoflu-
orescence, the saliva can be assumed to contain no virus, and the person bitten does not require
treatment.
If the biting animal is a particularly rare or valuable specimen and the risk of rabies small, public
health authorities may choose to administer postexposure treatment to the bite victim in lieu of killing
the animal for rabies testing (46). Such animals should be quarantined for 30 days.
Rodents (such as squirrels, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rats, and mice) and
lagomorphs (including rabbits and hares) are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have
not been known to cause rabies among humans in the United States. However, from 1971 through
1988, woodchucks accounted for 70% of the 179 cases of rabies among rodents reported to CDC (47).
In all cases involving rodents, the state or local health department should be consulted before a
decision is made to initiate postexposure antirabies prophylaxis.
Exotic pets (including ferrets) and domestic animals crossbred with wild animals are considered
wild animals by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) and the
Conference of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) because they may be highly susceptible to
rabies and could transmit the disease. Because the period of rabies virus shedding in these animals is
unknown, these animals should be killed and tested rather than confined and observed when they bite
humans (46 ). Wild animals (skunks, raccoons, and bats) and wild animals crossbred with dogs should
not be kept as pets (46).
Domestic Animals
The likelihood that a domestic animal is infected with rabies varies by region; hence, the need for
postexposure prophylaxis also varies. In the continental United States, rabies among dogs is reported
most commonly along the U.S.-Mexico border and sporadically from the areas of the United States
with enzootic wildlife rabies, especially the Midwest. During most of the 1980s in the United States,
more cats than dogs were reported rabid; the majority of these cases were associated with the
mid-Atlantic epizootic of rabies among raccoons. The large number of rabies-infected cats may be
attributed to fewer cat vaccination laws, fewer leash laws, and the roaming habits of cats. Cattle tend
to be most often exposed to rabies via rabid skunks.
In areas where canine rabies is not enzootic (including virtually all of the United States and its
territories), a healthy domestic dog or cat that bites a person should be confined and observed for 10
days. Any illness in the animal during confinement or before release should be evaluated by a
veterinarian and reported immediately to the local health department. If signs suggestive of rabies
develop, the animal should be humanely killed and its head removed and shipped, under refrigeration,
for examination by a qualified laboratory. Any stray or unwanted dog or cat that bites a person should
be killed immediately and the head submitted as described for rabies examination (46).
In most developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America, dogs are the major
vector of rabies; exposures to dogs in such countries represent a special threat. Travelers to these
countries should be aware that >50% of the rabies cases among humans in the United States result
from exposure to dogs outside the United States. Although dogs are the main reservoir of rabies in
these countries, the epizootiology of the disease among animals differs sufficiently by region or
country to warrant the evaluation of all animal bites.
4


## p. 5 (#353) ##############################################

Exposures to dogs in canine rabies-enzootic areas outside the United States carry a high risk; some
authorities therefore recommend that postexposure rabies treatment be initiated immediately after
such exposures. Treatment can be discontinued if the dog or cat remains healthy during the 10-day
observation period.
Circumstances of Biting Incident and Vaccination Status of Exposing Animal
An unprovoked attack by a domestic animal is more likely than a provoked attack to indicate that the
animal is rabid. Bites inflicted on a person attempting to feed or handle an apparently healthy animal
should generally be regarded as provoked.
A fully vaccinated dog or cat is unlikely to become infected with rabies, although rare cases have
been reported (48). In a nationwide study of rabies among dogs and cats in 1988, only one dog and
two cats that were vaccinated contracted rabies (49). All three of these animals had received only
single doses of vaccine; no documented vaccine failures occurred among dogs or cats that had
received two vaccinations.
POSTEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS: LOCAL TREATMENT OF WOUNDS AND
VACCINATION
The essential components of rabies postexposure prophylaxis are local wound treatment and the
administration, in most instances, of both HRIG and vaccine (Table 2). Persons who have been bitten
by animals suspected or proven rabid should begin treatment within 24 hours. However, there have
been instances when the decision to begin treatment was not made until many months after the
exposure because of a delay in recognition that an exposure had occurred and awareness that
incubation periods of >1 year have been reported.
In 1977, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a regimen of RIG and six doses of
HDCV over a 90-day period. This recommendation was based on studies in Germany and Iran (16,20).
When used this way, the vaccine was found to be safe and effective in protecting persons bitten by
proven rabid animals and induced an excellent antibody response in all recipients (16). Studies
conducted in the United States by CDC have shown that a regimen of one dose of HRIG and five doses
of HDCV over a 28-day period was safe and induced an excellent antibody response in all recipients
(15).

## p. 6 (#354) ##############################################

Local Treatment of Wounds
Immediate and thorough washing of all bite wounds and scratches with soap and water is an
important measure for preventing rabies. In studies of animals, simple local wound cleansing has been
shown to reduce markedly the likelihood of rabies (50,51 ). Tetanus prophylaxis and measures to
control bacterial infection should be given as indicated. The decision to suture large wounds should
take into account cosmetic factors and the potential for bacterial infections.
Immunization
Vaccine Usage
Two rabies vaccines are currently available in the United States; either is administered in
conjunction with HRIG at the beginning of postexposure therapy. A regimen of five 1-ml doses of HDCV
or RVA should be given intramuscularly. The first dose of the five-dose course should be given as soon
as possible after exposure. Additional doses should be given on days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after the first
vaccination. For adults, the vaccine should always be administered IM in the deltoid area. For children,
the anterolateral aspect of the thigh is also acceptable. The gluteal area should never be used for HDCV
or RVA injections, since administration in this area results in lower neutralizing antibody titers (52 ).
Postexposure antirabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody
and vaccine, with the exception of persons who have previously received complete vaccination
regimens (preexposure or postexposure) with a cell culture vaccine, or persons who have been
vaccinated with other types of vaccines and have had documented rabies antibody titers. These
persons should receive only vaccine (see Postexposure Therapy of Previously Vaccinated Persons).
The combination of HRIG (local and systemic) and vaccine is recommended for both bite and nonbite
exposures (see Postexposure Prophylaxis: Rationale for Treatment), regardless of the interval between
exposure and initiation of treatment.
Because the antibody response after the recommended postexposure vaccination regimen with
HDCV or RVA has been satisfactory, routine postvaccination serologic testing is not recommended.
Serologic testing is only indicated in unusual instances, as when the patient is known to be
immunosuppressed. The state health department may be contacted for recommendations on this
matter.
HRIG Usage
HRIG is administered only once (i.e., at the beginning of antirabies prophylaxis) to provide
immediate antibodies until the patient responds to HDCV or RVA by actively producing antibodies. If
HRIG was not given when vaccination was begun, it can be given through the seventh day after
administration of the first dose of vaccine. Beyond the seventh day, HRIG is not indicated since an
antibody response to cell culture vaccine is presumed to have occurred. The recommended dose of
HRIG is 20 IU/kg. This formula is applicable for all age groups, including children. If anatomically
feasible, up to one-half the dose of HRIG should be thoroughly infiltrated in the area around the wound
and the rest should be administered intramuscularly in the gluteal area. HRIG should never be
administered in the same syringe or into the same anatomical site as vaccine. Because HRIG may
partially suppress active production of antibody, no more than the recommended dose should be
given (53).
VACCINATION AND SEROLOGIC TESTING
The effectiveness of rabies vaccines is primarily measured by their ability to protect persons
exposed to rabies. HDCV has been used effectively with HRIG or equine antirabies serum (ARS)
worldwide to treat persons bitten by various rabid animals (15,16). An estimated one million people
worldwide have received rabies postexposure prophylaxis with HDCV since its introduction 12 years
ago (54).
In studies of animals, antibody titers have been shown to be markers of protection. Antibody titers
will vary with time since the last vaccination. Differences among laboratories that test blood samples
may also influence the results.
Serologic Response Shortly After Vaccination
All persons tested at CDC 2-4 weeks after completion of preexposure and postexposure rabies
prophylaxis according to ACIP guidelines have demonstrated an antibody response to rabies
6


## p. 7 (#355) ##############################################

(15,55,56 ). Therefore, it is not necessary to test serum samples from patients completing preexposure
or postexposure prophylaxis to document seroconversion unless the person is immunosuppressed
(see Precautions and Contraindications). If titers are obtained, specimens collected 2-4 weeks after
preexposure or postexposure prophylaxis should completely neutralize challenge virus at a 1:25
serum dilution by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). (This dilution is approximately
equivalent to the minimum titer of 0.5 IU recommended by the WHO.)
Serologic Response and Preexposure Booster Doses of Vaccine
Two years after primary preexposure vaccination, a 1:5 serum dilution will fail to neutralize
challenge virus completely (by RFFIT) among 2%-7% of persons who received the three-dose
preexposure series intramuscularly and 5%-17% of persons who received the three-dose series
intradermally (57). If the titer falls below 1:5, a preexposure booster dose of vaccine is recommended
for a person at continuous or frequent risk (Table 3) of exposure to rabies. The following guidelines are
recommended for determining when serum testing should be performed after primary preexposure
vaccination:
1. A person in the continuous risk category (Table 3) should have a serum sample tested for rabies
antibody every 6 months (58).
2. A person in the frequent risk category (Table 3) should have a serum sample tested for rabies
antibody every 2 years.
State or local health departments may provide the names and addresses of laboratories performing
rabies serologic testing.
POSTEXPOSURE TREATMENT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES
U.S. citizens and residents who are exposed to rabies while traveling outside the United States in
countries where rabies is endemic may sometimes receive postexposure therapy with regimens or

biologics that are not used in the United States. The following information is provided to familiarize
physicians with some of the regimens used more widely abroad. These schedules have not been
submitted for approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. If
postexposure treatment is begun outside the United States using one of these regimens or biologics
of nerve tissue origin, it may be necessary to provide additional treatment when the patient reaches the
United States. State or local health departments should be contacted for specific advice in such cases.
Modifications to the postexposure vaccine regimen approved for use in the United States have been
made to reduce the cost of postexposure prophylaxis and hasten the development of active immunity
(59). Costs are reduced primarily by substituting various schedules of ID injections (0.1 ml each) of
HDCV (or newer tissue culture-derived rabies vaccines for humans) for IM injection of HDCV. Two such
regimens are efficacious among persons bitten by rabid animals (60). One of these regimens consists
of 0.1-ml ID doses of HDCV given at eight different sites (deltoid, suprascapular, thigh, and abdominal
wall) on day 0; four ID 0.1-ml doses given at four sites on day 7 (deltoid, thigh); and one ID 0.1-ml dose
given in the deltoid on both day 28 and 91. Another ID regimen shown to be efficacious and now widely
used in Thailand employs Purified VERO Cell Rabies Vaccine (Pasteur-Merieux), with 0.1-ml doses
given at two different sites on days 0,3, and 7, followed by one 0.1-ml booster on days 30 and 90 (61 ).
Strategies designed to hasten the development of active immunity have concentrated on adminis-
tering more IM or ID doses at the time postexposure prophylaxis is initiated with fewer doses
thereafter (62 ). The most extensively evaluated regimen in this category, developed in Yugoslavia, has
been the 2-1-1 regimen (two 1.0-ml IM doses on day 0, and one each on days 7 and 21) (63-65 ).
However, when using HRIG in conjunction with this schedule, there may be some suppression of the
neutralizing antibody response (65).
Purified antirabies sera of equine origin (Sclavo; Pasteur-Merieux; Swiss Serum and Vaccine
Institute, Bern) have been used effectively in developing countries where HRIG may not be available.
The incidence of adverse reactions has been low (0.8%-6.0%) and most of those that occurred were
minor (66-68 ).
Although no postexposure vaccine failures have occurred in the United States during the 10 years
that HDCV has been licensed, seven persons have contracted rabies after receiving postexposure
treatment with both HRIG and HDCV outside the United States. An additional six persons have
contracted the disease after receiving postexposure prophylaxis with other cell culture-derived
vaccines and HRIG or ARS. However, in each of these cases, there was some deviation from the
recommended postexposure treatment protocol (69-71 ). Specifically, patients who contracted rabies
after postexposure prophylaxis did not have their wounds cleansed with soap and water or other
antiviral agents, did not receive their rabies vaccine injections in the deltoid area (i.e., vaccine was
administered in the gluteal area), or did not receive passive vaccination around the wound site.
PREEXPOSURE VACCINATION AND POSTEXPOSURE THERAPY OF PREVIOUSLY
VACCINATED PERSONS
Preexposure vaccination should be offered to persons among high-risk groups, such as veterinar-
ians, animal handlers, certain laboratory workers, and persons spending time (e.g., 1 month) in foreign
countries where canine rabies is endemic. Other persons whose activities bring them into frequent
contact with rabies virus or potentially rabid dogs, cats, skunks, raccoons, bats, or other species at risk
of having rabies should also be considered for preexposure prophylaxis.
Preexposure prophylaxis is given for several reasons. First, it may provide protection to persons
with inapparent exposures to rabies. Second, it may protect persons whose postexposure therapy
might be delayed. Finally, although preexposure vaccination does not eliminate the need for additional
therapy after a rabies exposure, it simplifies therapy by eliminating the need for HRIG and decreasing
the number of doses of vaccine needed - a point of particular importance for persons at high risk of
being exposed to rabies in areas where immunizing products may not be available or where they may
carry a high risk of adverse reactions.

Primary Preexposure Vaccination
Intramuscular Primary Vaccination
Three 1.0-ml injections of HDCV or RVA should be given intramuscularly (deltoid area), one each on
days 0, 7, and 21 or 28 (Table 4). In a study in the United States, >1,000 persons received HDCV
according to this regimen. Antibody was demonstrated in serum samples of all subjects when tested
by the RFFIT. Other studies have produced comparable results (33,56,72,73 ).
Intradermal Primary Vaccination
A regimen of three 0.1-ml doses of HDCV, one each on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28 (10,33,34,36,72,73),
is also used for preexposure vaccination (Table 4). The ID dose/route has been recommended
previously by the ACIP as an alternative to the 1.0-ml IM dose/route for rabies preexposure prophylaxis
with HDCV (24,74).
Pasteur-Merieux developed a syringe containing a single dose of lyophilized HDCV (Imovax® Rabies
I.D.) that is reconstituted in the syringe just before administration. The syringe is designed to deliver
0.1 ml of HDCV reliably and was approved by the FDA in 1986 (24). The 0.1-ml ID doses, given in the
area over the deltoid (lateral aspect of the upper arm) on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28, are used for primary
preexposure vaccination. One 0.1-ml ID dose is used for booster vaccination (see Table 3). The 1.0-ml
vial is not approved for multi-dose ID use. RVA should not be given by the ID dose/route (26).
Chloroquine phosphate (administered for malaria chemoprophylaxis) interferes with the antibody
response to HDCV (75). Accordingly, HDCV should not be administered by the ID dose/route to
persons traveling to malaria-endemic countries while the person is receiving chloroquine (76). The IM
dose/route of preexposure prophylaxis provides a sufficient margin of safety in this situation (76). For
persons who will be receiving both rabies preexposure prophylaxis and chloroquine in preparation for
travel to a rabies-enzootic area, the ID dose/route should be initiated at least 1 month before travel to
allow for completion of the full three-dose vaccine series before antimalarial prophylaxis begins. If this
schedule is not possible, the IM dose/route should be used. Although interference with the immune
response to rabies vaccine by other antimalarials structurally related to chloroquine (e.g., mefloquine)
has not been evaluated, it would seem prudent to follow similar precautions for persons receiving
these drugs.
Booster Vaccination
Preexposure Booster Doses of Vaccine
Persons who work with live rabies virus in research laboratories or vaccine production facilities
(continuous risk category; see Table 3) are at the highest risk of inapparent exposures. Such persons
should have a serum sample tested for rabies antibody every 6 months (Table 4). Booster doses (IM or
ID) of vaccine should be given to maintain a serum titer corresponding to at least complete
neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by the RFFIT. The frequent risk category includes other laboratory
workers, such as those doing rabies diagnostic testing, spelunkers, veterinarians and staff, animal-
control and wildlife officers in areas where animal rabies is epizootic, and international travelers living
or visiting (for >30 days) in areas where canine rabies is endemic. Persons among this group should
have a serum sample tested for rabies antibody every 2 years and, if the titer is less than complete
neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by the RFFIT, should have a booster dose of vaccine.
Alternatively, a booster can be administered in lieu of a titer determination. Veterinarians and animal

control and wildlife officers working in areas of low rabies enzooticity (infrequent exposure group) do
not require routine preexposure booster doses of HDCV or RVA after completion of primary
preexposure vaccination (Table 3).
Postexposure Therapy of Previously Vaccinated Persons
If exposed to rabies, persons previously vaccinated should receive two IM doses (1.0 ml each) of
vaccine, one immediately and one 3 days later. Previously vaccinated refers to persons who have
received one of the recommended preexposure or postexposure regimens of HDCV or RVA, or those
who received another vaccine and had a documented rabies antibody titer. HRIG is unnecessary and
should not be given in these cases because an anamnestic antibody response will follow the
administration of a booster regardless of the prebooster antibody titer (77).
Preexposure Vaccination and Serologic Testing
Because the antibody response after these recommended preexposure prophylaxis vaccine regi-
mens has been satisfactory, serologic testing is not necessary except for persons suspected of being
immunosuppressed. Patients who are immunosuppressed by disease or medications should postpone
preexposure vaccinations. Immunosuppressed persons who are at risk of rabies exposure should be
vaccinated and their antibody titers checked.
UNINTENTIONAL INOCULATION WITH MODIFIED LIVE RABIES VIRUS
Veterinary personnel may be inadvertently exposed to attenuated rabies virus while administering
modified live rabies virus (MLV) vaccines to animals. Although there have been no reported rabies
cases among humans resulting from exposure to needle sticks or sprays with licensed MLV vaccines,
vaccine-induced rabies has occurred among animals given these vaccines. Absolute assurance of a
lack of risk for humans, therefore, cannot be given. The best evidence for low risk is the absence of
recognized cases of vaccine-associated disease among humans despite frequent inadvertent expo-
sures.
MLV animal vaccines that are currently available are made with one attenuated strain of rabies virus:
high egg passage (HEP) Flury strain. The HEP Flury strain has been used in animal vaccines for more
than 25 years without evidence of associated disease among humans; therefore, postexposure
treatment is not recommended following exposure to this type of vaccine by needle sticks or sprays.
Because the data are insufficient to assess the true risk associated with any of the MLV vaccines,
preexposure vaccination and periodic boosters are recommended for all persons whose activities
either bring them into contact with potentially rabid animals or who frequently handle attenuated
animal rabies vaccine.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Human Diploid Cell Rabies Vaccine and Rabies Vaccine Adsorbed
Reactions after vaccination with HDCV and RVA are less serious and common than with previously
available vaccines (78,79). In studies using a three-dose postexposure regimen of HDCV, local
reactions, such as pain, erythema, and swelling or itching at the injection site, have been reported
among 30%-74% of recipients. Systemic reactions, such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle
aches, and dizziness have been reported among 5%-40% of recipients. Three cases of neurologic
illness resembling Guillain-Barré syndrome that resolved without sequelae in 12 weeks have been
reported (10,80,81 ). In addition, a few other subacute central and peripheral nervous system disorders
have been temporally associated with HDCV vaccine, but a causal relationship has not been
established (82).
An immune complex-like reaction occurs among approximately 6% of persons receiving booster
doses of HDCV (11,12) 2-21 days after administration of the booster dose. These patients develop a
generalized urticaria, sometimes accompanied by arthralgia, arthritis, angioedema, nausea, vomiting,
fever, and malaise. In no cases have the illnesses been life-threatening. This reaction occurs much less
frequently among persons receiving primary vaccination.
10


## p. 11 (#359) #############################################

The reaction has been associated with the presence of betapropiolactone-altered human serum
albumin in the HDCV and the development of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to this allergen
(83,84). Among persons who have received their primary vaccination series with HDCV, administra-
tion of boosters with a purified HDCV produced in Canada (Connaught Laboratories Ltd., Rabies
Vaccine Inactivated (Diploid Cell Origin)-Dried) does not appear to be associated with this reaction
(57). This vaccine is not yet licensed in the United States.
Vaccines and Immune Globulins Used in Other Countries
Many developing countries use inactivated nerve tissue vaccines made from the brains of adult
animals or suckling mice. Nerve tissue vaccine (NTV) is reported to induce neuroparalytic reactions
among approximately 1 per 200 to 1 per 2,000 vaccinees; suckling mouse brain vaccine (SMBV) causes
reactions in among approximately 1 per 8,000 (17).
Human Rabies Immune Globulins
Local pain and low-grade fever may follow receipt of HRIG. Although not reported specifically for
HRIG, angioneurotic edema, nephrotic syndrome, and anaphylaxis have been reported after injection
of immune globulin (IG). These reactions occur so rarely that a causal relationship between IG and
these reactions is not clear.
There is no evidence that hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the causative
agent of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS]), or other viruses have ever been transmitted
by commercially available HRIG in the United States.
Management of Adverse Reactions
Once initiated, rabies prophylaxis should not be interrupted or discontinued because of local or mild
systemic adverse reactions to rabies vaccine. Usually such reactions can be successfully managed with
anti-inflammatory and antipyretic agents (e.g., aspirin).
When a person with a history of serious hypersensitivity to rabies vaccine must be revaccinated,
antihistamines may be given. Epinephrine should be readily available to counteract anaphylactic
reactions, and the person should be observed carefully immediately after vaccination.
Although serious systemic, anaphylactic, or neuroparalytic reactions are rare during and after the
administration of rabies vaccines, such reactions pose a serious dilemma for the attending physician
(11). A patient's risk of acquiring rabies must be carefully considered before deciding to discontinue
vaccination. Advice and assistance on the management of serious adverse reactions for persons
receiving rabies vaccines may be sought from the state health department or CDC.
All serious systemic, neuroparalytic, or anaphylactic reactions to HDCV should be reported
immediately to Connaught Laboratories, Inc., Swiftwater, PA 18370. Phone: (800) VACCINE or (717)
839-7187. Serious reactions after the administration of RVA should be reported immediately to
Coordinating Physicians, Bureau of Laboratories and Epidemiological Services, Michigan Department
of Public Health, P. O. Box 30035, 3500 N. Logan, Lansing, MI 48909. Phone: (517) 335-8050.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
Immunosuppression
Corticosteroids, other immunosuppressive agents, antimalarials, and immunosuppressive illnesses
can interfere with the development of active immunity after vaccination and may predispose the
patient to rabies (75,85 ). Preexposure prophylaxis should be administered to such persons with the
awareness that the immune response may be inadequate (see Intradermal Primary Vaccination).
Immunosuppressive agents should not be administered during postexposure therapy unless essential
for the treatment of other conditions. When rabies postexposure prophylaxis is administered to
persons receiving steroids or other immunosuppressive therapy, it is especially important that a serum
sample be tested for rabies antibody to ensure that an acceptable antibody response has developed
(see Vaccination and Serologic Testing).
Pregnancy
Because of the potential consequences of inadequately treated rabies exposure, and because there
is no indication that fetal abnormalities have been associated with rabies vaccination, pregnancy is not
11


## p. 12 (#360) #############################################

considered a contraindication to postexposure prophylaxis (86). If there is substantial risk of exposure
to rabies, preexposure prophylaxis may also be indicated during pregnancy.
Allergies
Persons who have a history of serious hypersensitivity to rabies vaccine should be revaccinated with
caution (see Management of Adverse Reactions).

Inactivated Japanese Encephalitis Virus Vaccine
Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP)
Summary
Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine was available in the United States from
1983 through 1987 on an investigational basis, through travel clinics in collabo-
ration with CDC (1). JE vaccine manufactured by Biken and distributed by
Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine, inactivated,
JE-VAX), was licensed on December 10, 1992, to meet the needs of increasing
numbers of U.S. residents traveling to Asia and to accommodate the needs of
the U.S. military.
INTRODUCTION
Japanese encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne arboviral infection, is the leading
cause of viral encephalitis in Asia (2-4). Approximately 50,000 sporadic and epidemic
cases of JE are reported annually from the People's Republic of China (PRC), Korea,
Japan, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and parts of Oceania. Viral transmis-
sion occurs across a much broader area of the region than is recognized by
epidemiologic surveillance (Figure 1).
JE virus is related antigenically to the flaviviruses of St. Louis encephalitis and Mur-
ray Valley encephalitis, and to West Nile virus (5). Infection leads to overt encephalitis
in only 1 of 20 to 1,000 cases. Encephalitis usually is severe, resulting in a fatal out-
come in 25% of cases and residual neuropsychiatric sequelae in 30% of cases (2,6).
Limited data indicate that JE acquired during the first or second trimesters of preg-
nancy causes intrauterine infection and miscarriage (7,8). Infections that occur during
the third trimester of pregnancy have not been associated with adverse outcomes in
newborns.
The virus is transmitted in an enzootic cycle among mosquitoes and vertebrate-
amplifying hosts, chiefly domestic pigs and Ardeid (wading) birds (2). Culex mosqui-
toes, primarily Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, are the principal vectors. Viral infection rates in
the mosquitoes range from <1% to 3%. These species are prolific in rural areas where
their larvae breed in ground pools and especially in flooded rice fields. All elements of
the transmission cycle are prevalent in rural areas of Asia, and human infections occur
principally in this setting. Because vertebrate-amplifying hosts and agricultural activi-
ties may be situated within and at the periphery of cities, JE cases occasionally are
reported from urban locations.
JE virus is transmitted seasonally in most areas of Asia (Table 1). In temperate re-
gions, JE virus is transmitted during the summer and early fall, approximately from
May to September (2–6). In subtropical and tropical areas, seasonal patterns of viral
transmission are correlated with the abundance of vector mosquitoes and of verte-
brate-amplifying hosts. These, in turn, fluctuate with rainfall, with the rainy season,
and with migratory patterns of avian-amplifying hosts. In some tropical locations,
however, irrigation associated with agricultural practices is a more important factor

affecting vector abundance, and transmission may occur year-round (9–12). Patterns
of JE viral transmission vary regionally, within individual countries, and from year to
year.
In areas where JE is endemic, annual incidence ranges from 1 to 10 per 10,000 (13).
Children <15 years of age are principally affected. Seroprevalence studies indicate
nearly universal exposure by adulthood (calculating from a ratio of asymptomatic to
symptomatic infections of 200 to 1, approximately 10% of the susceptible population
is infected per year). In developed countries of Asia and in areas where children are

protected by immunization, a secondary increase in JE incidence has been observed
in the elderly ( 14). These observations suggest a biological basis for increased JE risk
with age because of waning immunity or other factors.
RISK FOR ACQUIRING JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS
AMONG TRAVELERS
Risk for acquiring JE among most travelers to Asia is extremely low; however, the
risk for an individual traveler is highly variable and depends on factors such as the
season, locations and duration of travel, and activities of the person. Travel during the
transmission season and exposure in rural areas, especially for extended periods of
time, are the principal factors contributing to risk. The extent and nature of outdoor
activity, use of protective clothing, bed nets and repellents, and lodging in air-condi-
tioned or well-screened rooms are additional factors that affect exposure. Residents of
developed countries usually have no natural immunity to JE virus and travelers of all
ages are equally susceptible to infection with JE virus; however, the elderly may be
more susceptible to developing neuroinvasive disease.
Although the probability of exposure to JE viral infection and illness increases with
the duration of stay in rural endemic areas, one case occurred in a traveler who made
only a few excursions into rural areas while on a 2-week vacation ( 15 ).
Since 1981, 11 U.S. residents have been infected with JE virus; eight were military
personnel or their dependents (Table 2) (15–17; Tsai TF, Hoke CH, unpublished obser-
vations ). Thirteen additional JE cases have been recognized among other western
expatriates and travelers. Although figures for travelers at risk are imprecise, a crude

estimate, based on the number of outbound airline passengers to Asia (2 to 3 million
U.S. citizens annually during the past 5 years (U.S. Department of Transportation, un-
published data ]), suggests that the risk of acquiring JE among U.S. travelers is <1 per
million annually. This estimate may be low because short-term travelers to developed
and urban areas probably constitute the majority of visitors to Asia and not all travel-
ers with JE will have been recognized. Moreover, between 1984 and 1987 JE vaccine
was available on a limited basis in the United States and some travelers at high risk
were protected by vaccination (1,17).
For travelers to rural areas where JE is endemic, risk per month of exposure can be
extrapolated from incidence rates in the resident population. Assuming an annual in-
cidence rate of 10 per 10,000, and recognizing that nearly all cases occur within a
5-month period, the estimated risk for JE during a 1-month period (the transmission
season) is 1 per 5,000 or 1 per 20,000 per week. Similar rates (<0.1-2.1 per 10,000 per
week) have been observed in non-immunized Western military personnel in Asia (data
from 1945 through 1991) (18-23).
The risk for developing JE after a mosquito bite can be factored into a series of
probabilities. Only bites of vector mosquitoes pose a risk and fewer than 3% of vector
mosquitoes are likely to be infected. Only one of approximately 200 infections leads to
neuroinvasive disease. The use of bed nets, insect repellents and protective clothing,
and avoidance of outdoor activity, especially during twilight periods and in the eve-
ning, will reduce risk even further.
INACTIVATED JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS VACCINE
An inactivated JE vaccine derived from infected mouse brain has been licensed in
Japan since 1954 (24). JE vaccine licensed in the United States is produced by the
Research Institute of Osaka University (Biken) and is distributed by Connaught Labo-
ratories Inc. The Biken vaccine is the most widely used JE vaccine of its type.
Similar mouse brain derived JE vaccines are produced by other manufacturers in
India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam (25,26). In the PRC, inactivated
and attenuated JE vaccines are produced in primary hamster kidney cells (27,28).
The Biken vaccine is prepared with the Nakayama-NIH strain of JE virus, originally
isolated in 1935 from an infected human. The vaccine is produced from infected
mouse brains by a sequence of protamine sulfate treatment, formalin inactivation, ul-
tra-filtration, and ammonium sulfate precipitation. The vaccine is purified further by
ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion. Gelatin is added as a stabilizer during
several steps of the process. No myelin basic protein (MBP) can be detected in the
vaccine at a level of 2 ng/mL, the detection threshold of the MBP assay. Thimerosal is
added as a preservative. Vaccine potency is determined in comparison with a refer-
ence vaccine of known clinical efficacy.
VACCINE EFFICACY
Efficacy was demonstrated in a single placebo-controlled trial conducted in Thai-
land (13). The study compared the efficacy of two doses of monovalent JE vaccine
prepared with the Nakayama-NIH strain (21,628 children) with two doses of a bivalent
vaccine also containing the Beijing strain (22,080 children); 21,516 children were ad-

ministered tetanus toxoid (TT) as a placebo. After 2 years, two JE cases were reported
among recipients of either JE vaccine and 11 cases were observed in the placebo co-
hort, for an overall vaccine efficacy of 91% (95% confidence interval [CI] of 70%-97%).
The monovalent and bivalent vaccines did not differ in their efficacy.
A prototype of the currently licensed vaccine, which was a less refined mouse
brain-derived product, was field tested in Taiwan in 1965 (29). Two doses of JE vaccine
or TT were administered under masked protocol to 111,749 and 131,865 children, re-
spectively; 22,194 children were administered a single dose of JE vaccine and 140,514
unvaccinated children also were observed. Observations during a single year showed
rates of 4 per 100,000 in recipients of two JE vaccine doses and 18 per 100,000 in
recipients of TT for a vaccine efficacy of 80%. A single vaccine dose had no demonstra-
ble efficacy.
IMMUNOGENICITY
Levels of neutralizing antibody that are considered protective have been defined by
animal challenge experiments (24). A neutralizing antibody titer of 21:10 in passively
immunized mice protected against challenge with 105 LD50 of JE virus, a viral dose
that might be transmitted by an infected mosquito. Thus neutralizing antibody titers >
1:10 (as determined by the technique used at Biken) have been presumed to protect
against natural infection.
The dosage regimen shown to be efficacious in the trials cited previously, which is
used for primary vaccination in many areas of Asia, consists of two doses adminis-
tered 1-4 weeks apart. However, immunogenicity studies in the United States and
among British subjects indicate that three doses are needed to provide protective lev-
els of neutralizing antibody in a suitable proportion of vaccinees (Table 3) (17,30 ).
Fewer than 80% of vaccinees receiving two doses seroconverted (reciprocal neutraliz-
ing antibody titer of 28–10). Moreover, after 6-12 months, only 29% of vaccinees still
had adequate antibody levels (17). The vaccine's efficacy and immunogenicity after
two doses in Asian subjects may reflect the effects of prior immunity or subsequent
exposures to JE, West Nile, dengue, and other flaviviruses circulating in Asia (31).
Although exposure to flaviviruses is almost universal at an early age in developing

areas of Asia, flaviviral infections are rare in North America and in most areas of
Europe.
Immunogenicity studies with another flaviviral vaccine (inactivated tick-borne en-
cephalitis (TBE) vaccine) showed that previous flaviviral infections or yellow fever
immunization augmented and accelerated the antibody response to TBE vaccine (32).
Preliminary studies do not indicate such an effect among JE vaccine recipients (De-
Fraites R, unpublished data ).
The vaccine was more immunogenic when administered in three doses during a
30-day period (days 0, 7, and 30) than during a shorter period of 2 weeks (days 0, 7,
and 14) (Table 3). Although all subjects seroconverted with either regimen, at 6
months geometric mean titers (GMT) were higher with the longer schedule (p<.0001)
(DeFraites R, unpublished data ).
The longevity of neutralizing antibody after primary vaccination is not known. The
GMT of vaccinees receiving three doses was unchanged between 6 months and 1 year
(1:76) after the primary series. After a booster dose was administered at 1 year, neu-
tralizing antibody titers increased sharply 3 months later to a mean titer of 1:1,117
(DeFraites R, unpublished data). Twenty-one subjects who did not receive a booster
retained elevated antibody titers for 2 years after primary vaccination (GMT 1:105).
Additional data on the persistence of antibody are pending. In one Japanese study,
antibody titers above 1:10 persisted for 3 years after a booster dose (33).
ADVERSE REACTIONS
JE vaccination is associated with a moderate frequency of local and mild systemic
side effects ( 13,17,25,26,34,35) (DeFraites R, unpublished data ). Tenderness, redness,
swelling, and other local effects have been reported in about 20% of vaccinees (<1%-
31%). Systemic side effects fever, headache, malaise, rash, and other reactions
such as chills, dizziness, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain — have been
reported in about 10% of vaccinees.
The neural tissue substrate of the vaccine has raised concerns about the possibility
of vaccine-related neurologic side effects (36). The amount of mouse MBP in the vac-
cine, if any, is well below levels associated with an encephalitogenic effect in a guinea
pig model. Surveillance of JE vaccine-related complications in Japan during the years
1965–1973, disclosed neurologic events (principally, encephalitis, encephalopathy, sei-
zures, and peripheral neuropathy) among 1 to 2.3 per million vaccinees (37) (Biken,
foundation for vaccination research, unpublished data ). One case of Guillain Barré
syndrome temporally related to JE vaccination has been reported in the United States
since 1984; however, this patient also had pharyngitis 3 weeks before the onset of
weakness and had a positive monospot test (DeFraites R, unpublished data ). A causal
relation between JE vaccination and temporally related neurologic events has not
been established in this or other cases.
Since 1989, an apparently new pattern of adverse reactions has been reported,
principally among travelers vaccinated in Australia, Europe, and North America
(35,38–39 )(Navy Environmental Health Center, unpublished data; Cambridge Self Di-
agnostic Services, unpublished data; and Andersen MM, Rone T, personal
communication) (Table 4). The reactions have been characterized by urticaria, often in
a generalized distribution, and/or angioedema of the extremities, face, and oro-

pharynx, especially of the lips. Three vaccine recipients developed respiratory dis-
tress. Distress or collapse because of hypotension or other causes led to
hospitalization for several persons. Most reactions were treated successfully with an-
tihistamines or oral steroids; however some patients were hospitalized for parenteral
steroid therapy. Three patients developed associated erythema multiforme or
erythema nodosum, and some patients have had joint swelling. Some vaccinees have
complained of generalized itching without objective evidence of a rash. The immu-
nologic mechanism of these adverse events has not been defined. Additional
immunologic studies are pending.
An important feature of these reactions has been the interval between vaccination
and onset of symptoms. Reactions after a first vaccine dose occurred after a median of
12 hours following vaccination (88% of reactions occurred within 3 days). The interval
between administration of a second dose and onset of symptoms generally was
longer (median 3 days) and possibly as long as 2 weeks. Reactions have occurred after
a second or third dose, when preceding doses were received uneventfully. Although
some observers have reported that reactions occur chiefly after a second or third
dose, one prospective study found similar reaction rates after first and second doses
(Navy Environmental Health Center, unpublished data ).
A case-control study among U.S. military personnel found an association between
reactions to JE vaccine and a past history of urticaria (after hymenoptera envenoma-
tion, medications, physical or other provocations or of idiopathic cause (relative risk
9.1, 95% CI 1.8–50.9]) (Navy Environmental Health Center, unpublished data ).
Surveillance of adverse reactions during a mass immunization campaign of 35,000
active duty U.S. military personnel and their dependents on Okinawa disclosed the
sudden death of a 21-year-old man who had received a first dose of JE vaccine 60
hours earlier. He also had received a third dose of plague vaccine on the day of death.
The man had a medical history of recurrent hypersensitivity phenomena and an epi-
sode of possible anaphylaxis. He reported no antecedent symptoms before he was
found dead, and the cause of death was not established at autopsy.
The incidence of these adverse reactions has varied widely depending on the cir-
cumstances of vaccine administration and surveillance (Table 4). In two reports from
travelers' clinics in Australia and Canada, rates of 50-104 per 10,000 vaccinees were
reported. National surveillance estimates in Denmark, Australia, the United Kingdom,
and Sweden are about 10-fold lower and range from 0.7 to 12 per 10,000. Studies
among U.S. citizens have disclosed rates of 15–62 per 10,000 (Table 4).
Whether this pattern of adverse reactions is new for JE vaccine is unclear. Data
from Denmark and Australia suggest that this may be the case. From 1983 to Novem-
ber 1989, no such adverse reactions were reported to the Danish State Serum Institute
among recipients of 161,000 doses. From November, 1989 to June 1991, 19 cases were
reported among 62,000 vaccine recipients (p <106, Poisson) (38). Although JE vac-
cine had been distributed to 4,000 persons in Australia since 1987, the seven adverse
reactions meeting the above description were reported only after June 1990 (38).
Other patients with similar clinical features were reported from the United Kingdom in
1991, from Canada in 1990, and Sweden in the period from 1989–1990. However, in
retrospect, similar adverse events were observed in a JE vaccine trial conducted from
1983 to 1987 in the United States ( 17). One patient had an anaphylactic reaction occur-
ring within 5 minutes of vaccination; the other subject developed generalized urticaria

7 hours after vaccination. Although the latter case initially was diagnosed as exercise-
induced urticaria, a relation of the reaction to JE vaccine cannot be excluded.
The vaccine constituent(s) responsible for these adverse events has (have) not
been identified. Twelve of 45 vaccine lots produced from April 1988 to January 1991
have been associated with this pattern of adverse reactions. However, 26 of the re-
maining 33 lots were distributed exclusively to Asian countries. The absence of similar
reports associated with these lots may be related to differences in the sensitivity of
surveillance for adverse reactions, variations in susceptibility of vaccinees in Asia, or
other lot variations. Therefore, whether the reactogenicity of JE vaccine produced re-
cently is associated only with certain lots, or whether a uniform pattern of
reactogenicity has gone undetected, is uncertain.
Post-marketing surveillance for adverse reactions occurring in the United States
will be established by the manufacturer.

VACCINE USAGE
U.S. Expatriates
JE vaccine is recommended for persons who plan to reside in areas where JE is
endemic or epidemic (residence during a transmission season) (40-44). Risk for ac-
quiring JE is highly variable within the endemic regions (Table 1, Figure 1). The
incidence of JE in the location of intended residence, the conditions of housing, nature
of activities, and the possibility of unexpected travel to high-risk areas are factors that
should be considered in the decision to seek vaccination.
Travelers
JE vaccine is NOT recommended for all travelers to Asia. In general, vaccine should
be offered to persons spending a month or longer in endemic areas during the trans-
mission season, especially if travel will include rural areas. Under specific
circumstances, vaccine should be considered for persons spending <30 days in en-
demic areas, e.g., travelers to areas experiencing epidemic transmission and persons
whose activities, such as extensive outdoor activities in rural areas, place them at high
risk for exposure. In all instances, travelers should be advised to take personal precau-
tions; e.g., to reduce exposure to mosquito bites.
The decision to use JE vaccine should balance the risks for exposure to the virus
(Table 1, Figure 1) and for developing illness, the availability and acceptability of repel-
lents and other alternative protective measures (44), and the side effects of
vaccination. Risk assessments should be interpreted cautiously (Table 1, Figure 1)
since risk can vary within areas and from year to year and available data are incom-
plete. Estimates suggest that risk of JE in highly endemic areas during the
transmission season can reach 1 per 5,000 per month of exposure; risk for most short-
term travelers may be s1 per million. Although JE vaccine is reactogenic, rates of
serious allergic reactions (generalized urticaria or angioedema) are low (1 to 104 per
10,000). Advanced age may be a risk factor for developing symptomatic illness after
infection. JE acquired during pregnancy carries the potential for intrauterine infection
and fetal death. These special factors should be considered when advising elderly per-
sons and pregnant women who plan visits to areas where JE is endemic.
Primary Immunization Schedule
The recommended primary immunization series is three doses of 1.0 mL each, ad-
ministered subcutaneously on days 0,7, and 30. An abbreviated schedule of days 0,7,
and 14 can be used when the longer schedule is impractical or inconvenient because
of time constraints. Two doses administered a week apart will confer short-term im-
munity among 80% of vaccinees (Table 3). However, this schedule should be used only
under unusual circumstances and is not routinely recommended. The last dose should
be administered at least 10 days before the commencement of travel to ensure an
adequate immune response and access to medical care in the event of delayed ad-
verse reactions.
The immunization schedule for children 1-3 years of age is identical except that the
manufacturer recommends 0.5 mL administered subcutaneously. No data are avail-
able on vaccine safety and efficacy in infants <1 year of age.

Booster Doses
Protective levels of neutralizing antibody persist for at least 2 years in vaccinees
who have completed a three-dose primary series. The full duration of protection is
unknown, therefore, definitive recommendations cannot be given on the timing of
booster doses. Booster doses of 1.0 mL (0.5 mL for children <3 years of age) may be
administered after 2 years.
PRECAUTIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS
Adverse Reactions and Hypersensitivity
Adverse reactions to JE vaccine manifesting as generalized urticaria and
angioedema have occurred within minutes to as long as 2 weeks after vaccination.
Epinephrine and other medications and equipment to treat anaphylaxis should be
available. Vaccinees should be observed for 30 minutes after vaccination and warned
about the possibility of delayed urticaria and angioedema of the head and airway. Vac-
cinees should be advised to remain in areas with ready access to medical care in the
10 days after receiving a dose of JE vaccine.
Persons with a history of certain allergic disorders (see ADVERSE REACTIONS) ap-
pear to have a greater risk for developing adverse reactions to JE vaccine. This history
should be considered when weighing the risks and benefits of the vaccine for an indi-
vidual patient. When patients with such a history are offered JE vaccine, they should
be alerted to their increased risk for reaction and monitored appropriately. There are
no data supporting the efficacy of prophylactic antihistamines or steroids in prevent-
ing JE vaccine-related allergic reactions.
JE vaccine is produced in mouse brains and should not be administered to persons
with a proven or suspected hypersensitivity to proteins of rodent or neural origin
(other vaccines produced in rodent neural tissue include experimental hantaviral vac-
cines produced in Korea and the PRC and the previously used French neurotropic
strain yellow fever vaccine (discontinued in 1982]). Hypersensitivity to thimerosal is a
contraindication to vaccination.
The vaccine should not be administered to persons who have had a previous ad-
verse reaction after receiving JE vaccine. Patients who develop allergic or unusual
adverse reactions after vaccination should be reported through the Vaccine Adverse
Event Reporting System (1-800-822-7967).
Age
No data are available on the safety and efficacy of JE vaccine among infants <1 year
of age. Whenever possible vaccination of infants should be deferred until they are 21
year of age.
Pregnancy
No specific information is available on the safety of JE vaccine in pregnancy. Vacci-
nation poses an unknown but theoretical risk to the developing fetus, and the vaccine
should not be routinely administered during pregnancy. Pregnant women who must
travel to an area where risk of JE is high should be vaccinated when the theoretical

risks of immunization are outweighed by the risk of infection to the mother and devel-
oping fetus.
Altered Immune States
The only data on the use of inactivated JE vaccine in patients with altered immune
states come from a small study among children. These data did not suggest a changed
pattern of adverse reactions or immune response after vaccination (45).
Simultaneous Administration of Other Vaccines or Drugs
Limited data suggest that the immunogenicity and safety of JE vaccination is not
compromised by simultaneous administration with DTP vaccine (Nisalak A, unpub-
lished data ). No data exist on the effect of concurrent administration of other
vaccines, drugs (e.g., chloroquine, mefloquine), or biologicals on the safety and im-
munogenicity of JE vaccine.
VACCINATION OF RESEARCH LABORATORY WORKERS
Twenty-two cases of laboratory-acquired JE have been reported (46). Although
work with JE virus is restricted to facilities with BL-3 capabilities, JE virus may be
transmitted in a laboratory setting through needlesticks and other accidental expo-
sures. Vaccine-derived immunity presumably protects against exposure through these
percutaneous routes. Exposure to aerosolized JE virus, and particularly to high con-
centrations of virus, that may occur during viral purification, potentially could lead to
infection through mucous membranes and possibly directly into the central nervous
system through the olfactory epithelium. Whether vaccine-derived immunity protects
against such exposures is unknown, but vaccination is recommended for all labora-
tory workers with a potential for exposure to infectious JE virus.
