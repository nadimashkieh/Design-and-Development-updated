Preface to the Fifth Edition
As expected, the art and science of immunization has continued to evolve since the fourth edition of
this book was published. Rotavirus vaccine was licensed in August 1998, and has been added to
the ever-expanding list of vaccines routinely recommended for children. Polio immunization recom-
mendations have changed again, with both the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and
the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommending the use of inactivated polio vaccine for at
least the first two doses of the polio series. A vaccine for Lyme Disease is now available. The use
of hepatitis A vaccine continues to expand.
Reports of cases of most vaccine-preventable diseases are at record low levels because coverage
levels for individual vaccines are at all-time highs. But series-complete vaccination levels are still
substantially below the year 2000 objective of 90%. Varicella vaccination levels are still unaccept-
ably low. And in the 2 minutes it will take for you to read this page, another 14 children will be born
somewhere in the United States (1997 estimate). The job of vaccinating our children will never end.
As immunization science evolves, so does this book, and the fifth edition has been extensively
revised. New information includes an updated discussion of adverse reactions and screening for
contraindications and precautions in the new General Recommendations on Immunization chapter;
new chapters for rotavirus and strategies to increase vaccination; and updated epidemiologic data
(including provisional 1998 data, when available) and revised vaccine recommendations. In addi-
tion, the appendices have been substantially rearranged and revised.
We believe this book should be a companion to the ACIP statements, not a replacement for them.
Consequently, for this edition, we have removed all ACIP statements from the appendices, including
the General Recommendations on Immunization. Every office and clinic that administers vaccines
should have a complete set of ACIP statements for reference. If you don't have a set, or your set
needs updating, instruction for getting them are in Appendix G. They're free for the asking.
I would like to thank my colleagues in the Training and Education Branch for their many hours of
writing and editing, and the many readers who provided us with comments and suggestions for this
edition. I would also like to thank Dr. Deborah Wexler and her staff at the Immunization Action
Coalition in St. Paul for allowing us to reproduce many of the Coalition's handouts and tables. You
will find these materials in Appendices A and C. They will be a valuable addition to your provider and
patient information resources.
Immunization will continue to change, so another edition of this book is almost inevitable. Let us
know how we can make future editions more useful to you in your day-to-day immunization
practices.

Immunology and Vaccine-Preventable
Disease
Immunology is a complicated subject, and a detailed
discussion of it is beyond the scope of this text. However,
an understanding of the basic function of the immune
system is useful in order to understand both how vaccines
work and the basis of recommendations for their use. The
description that follows is simplified. Many excellent
immunology textbooks are available to provide additional
detail.
Protection from infectious disease is referred to as
immunity. There are two basic mechanisms for acquiring
this protection — active and passive.
Active immunity is protection that is produced by the
person's own immune system. This type of immunity is
usually permanent.
Passive immunity is protection by products produced by
an animal or human, and transferred to another human,
usually by injection. Passive immunity often provides
effective protection, but this protection wanes (disappears)
over time, usually a few weeks or months.
The immune system is a complex system of interacting
cells whose primary purpose is to identify foreign (“non-
self") substances refered to as antigens. Antigens can be
either live (such as viruses and bacteria) or inactivated.
The immune system develops a defense against the
antigen. This defense is known as the immune response
and usually involves the production of protein molecules,
called antibodies (or immunoglobulins), and of specific
cells (also known as cell-mediated immunity) whose
purpose is to facilitate the elimination of foreign
substances.
The most effective immune responses are generally
produced in response to a live antigen. However, an
antigen does not necessarily have to be alive, as in a
natural infection with a virus or bacteria, to produce an
immune response. Some proteins, such as hepatitis B
surface antigen, are easily recognized by the immune
system. Other material, such as polysaccharide (long
chains of sugar molecules that make up the cell wall of
certain bacteria) are less effective antigens, and the
immune response may not provide as good protection.

## p. 3 (#15) ###############################################

PRINCIPLES OF WACC/MATION
An immune response is generally specific to the organism
or antigen that produced it. For example, antibodies
produced in response to measles virus have no effect on
rubella or influenza viruses.
Passive immunity
Passive immunity is the transfer of antibody produced by
one human or animal to another. Passive immunity
provides protection against some infections, but this
protection is temporary. The antibodies will degrade over
a period of weeks to months and the recipient will no
longer be immune.
The most common form of passive immunity is that which
an infant receives from its mother. Antibodies are
transported across the placenta during the last 1-2 months
of pregnancy. As a result, a full-term infant will have the
same antibody “profile” as its mother. These antibodies
will protect the infant from certain diseases for up to a
year. Protection is better against some diseases (e.g.,
measles, rubella, tetanus) than others (e.g., polio,
pertussis).
Virtually all types of blood products contain antibody.
Some products (e.g., washed or reconstituted red blood
cells) contain a relatively small amount of antibody, and
some (e.g., intravenous immune globulin and plasma
products) contain very large amounts.
Besides blood products used for transfusion (e.g., whole
blood, red cells, and platelets) there are three major
sources of antibody used in human medicine. These are
(1) homologous pooled human antibody (immune globulin),
(2) homologous human hyperimmune globulin, and (3)
heterologous hyperimmune serum (antitoxin).
Homologous pooled human antibody is also known as
immune globulin. It is produced by combining (pooling)
the IgG antibody fraction from thousands of adult donors
in the U.S. Because it comes from many different donors,
it contains antibody to many different antigens. It is used
primarily for post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis A and
measles.
Homologous human hyperimmune globulins are antibody
products that contain high titers of specific antibody.
These products are made from the donated plasma of
humans with high levels of the antibody of interest.
However, since hyperimmune globulins are from humans,
they also contain other antibodies in smaller quantities.
Passive Immunity
• Antibody transferred from
another person or animal
• Transplacental most important
source in infancy
• Temporary protection

Types of Passive Immunity

antibody (immune globulin)

PRINCIPLES OF WACCINATION
Vaccination
• Active immunity produced by
vaccine
• Immunity and immunologic
memory similar to natural
infection but without risk of
disease
Classification of Vaccines
• Live attenuated
• Inactivated
Hyperimmune globulins are used for post-exposure
prophylaxis for several diseases, including hepatitis B,
rabies, tetanus, and varicella.
Heterologous hyperimmune serum is also known as
antitoxin. This product is produced in animals, usually
horses (equine), and contains antibodies against only one
antigen. In the U.S., antitoxin is available for treatment of
botulism and diphtheria. A problem with this product is
serum sickness, a reaction to the horse protein.
Active immunity
Active immunity is stimulation of the immune system to
produce antigen-specific humoral (antibody) and cellular
immunity. Unlike passive immunity which is temporary,
active immunity usually lasts for many years, often for a
lifetime.
One way to acquire active immunity is to have the natural
disease. In general, once persons recover from infectious
diseases, they will be immune to those diseases for the
rest of their lives. The persistence of protection for many
years after the infection is known as immunologic
memory. Following exposure of the immune system to an
antigen, certain cells (memory B-cells) continue to
circulate in the blood (and also reside in the bone marrow)
for many years. Upon reexposure to the antigen, these
memory cells begin to replicate and produce antibody very
rapidly to reestablish protection.
Another way to produce active immunity is by vaccination.
Vaccines interact with the immune system and often
produce an immune response similar to that produced by
the natural infection, but do not subject the recipient to
the disease and its potential complications. Vaccines
produce immunologic memory similar to that acquired by
having the natural disease.
Many factors may influence the immune response to
vaccination. These include the presence of maternal
antibody, nature and dose of antigen, route of
administration, and the presence of adjuvants (e.g.,
aluminum-containing materials added to improve the
immunogenicity of the vaccine). Host factors such as age,
nutritional factors, genetics, and coexisting disease, may
also affect the response.
Classification of Vaccines
There are only two basic types of vaccines: live attenuated
and inactivated. The characteristics of live and inactivated
vaccines are different, and these characteristics determine
how the vaccine is used.

## p. 5 (#17) ###############################################

PRINCIPLES OF WACCINATION |s
Live attenuated vaccines are produced by modifying a
disease-producing (“wild”) virus or bacteria in a laboratory.
The resulting vaccine organism retains the ability to
replicate (grow) and produce immunity, but usually does
not cause illness. Live attenuated vaccines available in the
U.S. include live viruses and live bacteria.
Inactivated vaccines can be composed of either whole
viruses or bacteria, or fractions of either. Fractional
vaccines are either protein-based or polysaccharide-based.
Protein-based vaccines include toxoids (inactivated
bacterial toxin), and subunit or subvirion products. Most
polysaccharide-based vaccines are composed of pure cell-
wall polysaccharide from bacteria. Conjugate
polysaccharide vaccines are those in which the
polysaccharide is chemically linked to a protein. This
linkage makes the polysaccharide a more potent vaccine.
General Rule
The more similar a vaccine is to the natural disease,
the better the immune response to the vaccine.
Live attenuated vaccines
Live vaccines are derived from “wild,” or disease-causing,
virus or bacteria. These wild viruses or bacteria are
attenuated, or weakened, in a laboratory, usually by
repeated culturing. For example, the measles vaccine
used today was isolated from a child with measles disease
in 1954. Almost 10 years of serial passage on tissue culture
media was required to transform the wild virus into
vaccine virus.
In order to produce an immune response, live
attenuated vaccines must replicate (grow) in the
vaccinated person. A relatively small dose of virus or
bacteria is given, which replicates in the body and
increases to a volume large enough to stimulate an
immune response. Anything that either damages the live
organism in the vial (e.g., heat, light), or interferes with
replication of the organism in the body (circulating
antibody) can cause the vaccine to be ineffective.
Although live attenuated vaccines replicate, they usually
do not cause disease, such as may occur with the natural
(“wild") organism. When a live attenuated vaccine does
cause “disease,” it is usually much milder than the natural
disease, and is referred to as an adverse event.

6 PRINCIPLES OF WACCINATION
Live Attenuated Vaccines
• Severe reactions possible
* Reversion to pathogenic form
• Interference from circulating
antibody
• Unstable
Live Attenuated Vaccines
• Viral measles, mumps,
rubella, oral polio,
rotavirus, vaccinia,
varicella, yellow fever
• Bacterial BCG, oral typhoid
Inactivated Vaccines
• Cannot replicate
• Generally not as effective as
live vaccines
• Minimal interference from
circulating antibody
The immune response to a live attenuated vaccine is
virtually identical to that produced by a natural infection.
The immune system does not differentiate between an
infection with a weakened vaccine virus and an infection
with a wild virus.
Live attenuated vaccines may cause severe or fatal
reactions as a result of uncontrolled replication (growth) of
the vaccine virus. This only occurs in persons with
immunodeficiency (e.g., from leukemia, treatment with
certain drugs, or HIV infection).
A live attenuated vaccine virus could theoretically revert
back to its original pathogenic (disease-causing) form.
This is known to happen only with live polio vaccine.
Active immunity from a live attenuated vaccine may not
develop due to interference from circulating antibody to
the vaccine virus. Antibody from any source (e.g.,
transplacental, transfusion) can interfere with growth of
the vaccine organism and lead to nonresponse to the
vaccine (also known as vaccine failure). Measles vaccine
virus seems to be most sensitive to circulating antibody.
Polio and rotavirus vaccine viruses are least affected.
Live attenuated vaccines are labile, and can be damaged or
destroyed by heat and light. They must be handled and
stored carefully.
Currently available live attenuated vaccines include live
viruses (measles, mumps, rubella, polio, rotavirus, yellow
fever, vaccinia, and varicella), and two live bacterial
vaccines (BCG and oral typhoid).
Inactivated vaccines
These vaccines are produced by growing the bacteria or
virus in culture media, then inactivating it with heat and/
or chemicals (usually formalin). In the case of fractional
vaccines, the organism is further treated to purify only
those components to be included in the vaccine (e.g., the
polysaccharide capsule of pneumococcus).
Inactivated vaccines are not alive and cannot replicate.
The entire dose of antigen is administered in the injection.
These vaccines cannot cause disease from infection (even
in an immunodeficient person) and cannot mutate to a
pathogenic form.

tion.
ion
Unlike live antigens, inactivated antigens are usually not
affected by circulating antibody. Inactivated vaccines may
be given when antibody is present in the blood (e.g., in
infancy, or following receipt of antibody-containing blood
products).
Inactivated vaccines always require multiple doses. In
general, the first dose does not produce protective
immunity, but only “primes” the immune system. A
protective immune response develops after the second or
third dose.
In contrast to live vaccines, in which the immune response
closely resembles natural infection, the immune response
to an inactivated vaccine is mostly humoral. Little or no
cellular immunity results.
Antibody titers against inactivated antigens fall over time.
As a result, some inactivated vaccines may require periodic
supplemental doses to increase, or “boost,” antibody titers.
In some cases, the antigen critical to protection against the
disease may not be defined, thus requiring the use of
“whole cell” vaccines. Whole cell bacterial vaccines are
typically the most reactogenic (i.e., cause the most adverse
events). This is because of responses to cell components
that may not be needed for protection.
Currently available inactivated vaccines include
inactivated whole viruses (influenza, polio, rabies, hepatitis
A) and inactivated whole bacteria (pertussis, typhoid,
cholera, plague). “Fractional” vaccines include subunits
(hepatitis B, influenza, acellular pertussis, typhoid Vi,
Lyme disease), toxoids (diphtheria, tetanus, botulinum),
pure polysaccharides (pneumococcal, meningococcal,
Haemophilus influenzae type b), and polysaccharide
conjugates (Haemophilus influenzae type b and soon,
pneumococcal).
Polysaccharide vaccines
Polysaccharide vaccines are a unique type of inactivated
subunit vaccine composed of long chains of sugar molecules
that make up the surface capsule of certain bacteria. Pure
polysaccharide vaccines are available for three diseases:
pneumococcal disease, meningococcal disease, and
Haemophilus influenzae type b.
The immune response to a pure polysaccharide vaccine is
typically T-cell independent, which means that these
vaccines are able to stimulate B-cells without the
assistance of T-helper cells.

a PRINCIPLES OF WACC/MATION
Pure Polysaccharide Vaccines
T-cell independent antigens, including polysaccharide
vaccines, are not consistently immunogenic in children -2
years of age. Young children do not respond to
polysaccharide antigens for reasons that are not clear. It
probably has to do with immaturity of the immune system.
Repeat doses of polysaccharide vaccines do not cause a
booster response. Repeated doses of most inactivated
protein vaccines cause the antibody titer to go
progressively higher, or “boost.” This is not seen with
polysaccharide antigens.
Antibody induced with polysaccharide vaccines has less
functional activity than that induced by protein antigens.
This is because the predominant antibody produced in
response to polysaccharide vaccines is IgM, and little IgG
is produced.
In the late 1980s, it was discovered that the problems
noted above could be overcome through a process called
conjugation. Conjugation changes the immune response
from T-cell independent to T-cell dependent, leading to
increased immunogenicity in infants and antibody booster
response to multiple doses of vaccine.
The first conjugated polysaccharide vaccine was for
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). A conjugate vaccine
for pneumococcal disease may be available in the near
future.
Recombinant vaccines
Vaccine antigens may also be produced by genetic
engineering technology. These products are sometimes
referred to as recombinant vaccines. Three genetically-
engineered vaccines are currently available in the United
States. Hepatitis B vaccines are produced by insertion of a
segment of the hepatitis B virus gene into the gene of a
yeast cell. The modified yeast cell produces pure hepatitis
B surface antigen when it grows. Live typhoid vaccine
(Ty21a) is Salmonelli typhi bacteria that has been
genetically modified to not cause illness. Three of the four
viruses present in live rotavirus vaccine are genetically
modified rhesus monkey rotaviruses, which produce
human rotavirus antigens when they replicate.

on Immunization
Timing and Spacing of Vaccines
The timing and spacing of vaccine doses are two of the most
important issues in the appropriate use of vaccines. Specific
circumstances that are commonly encountered in
immunization practice are the timing of antibody-containing
blood products and live vaccines (particularly measles
vaccine), simultaneous and nonsimultaneous administration
of different vaccines, and the intervals between subsequent
doses of the same vaccine.
Antibody-vaccine interactions
General Rule
Inactivated vaccines generally are not affected by
circulating antibody to the antigen.
Live attenuated vaccines may be affected by
circulating antibody to the antigen.
The presence of circulating antibody against a vaccine
antigen may reduce or completely eliminate an immune
response to the vaccine. The amount of interference
produced by circulating antibody generally depends on the
type of vaccine administered and the amount of antibody.
Inactivated antigens are not substantially affected by
circulating antibody, so they can be administered before,
after, or at the same time as the antibody. Simultaneous
administration of antibody (in the form of immune globulin)
and vaccine is recommended for postexposure prophylaxis of
certain diseases, such as hepatitis B, rabies, and tetanus.

(see Table 8)
All live vaccines must replicate in order to cause an immune
response. Antibody against live injected vaccine antigen may
interfere with replication. If a live injected vaccine (MMR or
varicella) must be given around the time that antibody is
given, the two must be separated by enough time so that the
antibody does not interfere with viral replication. If the live
vaccine is given first, it is necessary to wait at least 2 weeks
(i.e., an incubation period) before giving the antibody. If the
interval between the vaccine and antibody is less than 2 weeks,
the recipient should be tested for immunity or the vaccine dose
should be repeated.
If the antibody is given before a dose of MMR or varicella
vaccine, it is necessary to wait until the antibody has waned
(degraded) before giving the vaccine. In past recommendations,
the interval between receipt of antibody (immune globulin or
other blood products) and live injected vaccines has been a
minimum of 6 weeks and preferably 3 months. However, a
recent study suggests that this interval is not always long
enough to eliminate interference between the antibody and the
vaccine.
The current recommendation is that the necessary interval
between an antibody-containing product and MMR or varicella
vaccine varies depending on the concentration of antibody in
the product. A table listing the recommended intervals
between antibody products and live vaccines (MMR and
varicella) is included in Appendix A, and in the General
Recommendations on Immunization.
Oral polio, rotavirus, and yellow fever vaccines are not affected
by the administration of immune globulin or blood products.
They may be given simultaneously with blood products, or
separated by any interval. Polio virus and rotavirus replicate
in the GI tract, and seem to be “protected” from the effects of
circulating antibody. Yellow fever vaccine is not affected
because few Americans are immune to yellow fever.
Consequently, donated blood products in the United States do
not contain a significant amount of yellow fever antibody.

Simultaneous and non-simultaneous administration
General Rule
There are no contraindications to simultaneous
administration of any vaccines.”
*except cholera and yellow fever
The simultaneous administration of the most widely used live and
inactivated vaccines does not result in decreased antibody responses or
increased rates of adverse reaction.
Yellow fever and cholera vaccines should not be administered
simultaneously. It has been observed that simultaneous administration of
these vaccines decreases the antibody response to both vaccines. These
vaccines should be separated by at least 3 weeks, if possible.
When vaccines commonly associated with local or systemic side effects
(e.g., cholera, whole cell killed typhoid, or plague) are given
simultaneously, the side effects might be accentuated. When feasible, it is
preferable to give these vaccines on separate occasions. This does not
apply to influenza and pertussis vaccines, which are recommended to be
given simultaneously when indicated.
Simultaneous administration of all vaccines for which a child is eligible can be
very important in childhood vaccination programs because it increases the
probability that a child will be fully immunized at the appropriate age. A
study during a recent measles outbreak showed that about one-third of
measles cases in unvaccinated but vaccine-eligible preschool children could
have been prevented if MMR had been administered at the same visit when
another vaccine was given.
Individual vaccines should not be mixed in the same syringe unless they
are licensed for mixing by the FDA. Only the Pasteur Meriuex /
Connaught Hib/whole cell DTP (ActFIIB/DTP) and Hib/DTaP (TriHIBitTM)
vaccines have been licensed for mixing in the same syringe.
Non-simultaneous administration of different vaccines
In some situations, vaccines that could be given simultaneously are not
(e.g., if the child is receiving vaccines from two different providers).
The table below gives the suggested intervals if vaccines are not
administered simultaneously.

## p. 12 (#24) ##############################################

GENERAL RECO/M/MENDATIONS OF //M/MUNIZATION
Live injected vaccines (MMR, varicella, and yellow
fever) that are not administered simultaneously
should be separated by at least 4 weeks. This precau-
tion is intended to reduce or eliminate interference from the
vaccine given first on the vaccine given later. If two live
injected vaccines are not administered simultaneously but
are separated by less than 4 weeks, it may be prudent to
repeat the vaccine given second, or confirm that the dose
was effective by serologic testing of the recipient.
Live oral vaccines (OPV, rotavirus, and oral typhoid) are not
believed to interfere with each other if not given simulta-
neously. These vaccines may be given at any time before or
after each other. Oral typhoid is not licensed for children
less than 6 years of age, and rotavirus vaccine should not be
used in children older than 12 months of age, so these vac-
cines will not be given to the same child under any circum-
Stances.
Injected live vaccines (MMR, varicella, and yellow fever) are
not believed to have an effect on live vaccines given orally
(OPV, rotavirus, and oral typhoid). Live oral vaccines may
be given at any time before or after live injected vaccines.
For reasons that are not clear, cholera and yellow fever
vaccines interfere with each other. These vaccines should
not be given simultaneously, and should be separated by at
least 3 weeks. Priority should always be given to yellow
fever vaccination of a person traveling to a yellow fever
endemic area. Cholera vaccine has very limited protective
efficacy, and is generally not recommended for travelers to
any part of the world.
All other combinations of two inactivated vaccines, or live
(injected or oral) and inactivated vaccines may be given at
any time before or after each other.
Interval between doses of the same vaccine
General Rule
Increasing the interval between doses of a multi-dose
vaccine does not diminish the effectiveness of the vaccine.
Decreasing the interval between doses of a multi-dose
vaccine may interfere with antibody response and protection.


## p. 13 (#25) ##############################################

GENERAL RECO/M/MENDATIONS OF //M/MUNIZATION
All vaccines should be administered as close to the
recommended schedule as possible to maximize the
protection from the vaccine. Recommended spacing between
doses should be maintained.
If a child is not up-to-date on his or her vaccinations, it may
be necessary to “accelerate” the normal schedule in order to
catch up. In this situation it is important to know how
closely the doses can be spaced and still be effective.
Another situation in which minimum spacing is important
is when vaccine is given in other countries. The spacing of
vaccines in other countries is frequently different from what
is acceptable in the United States. Additional details on
determining the acceptability of vaccines given in other
countries are given in the ACIP's 1994 General
Recommendations on Immunization.
Doses of a vaccine given too close together could reduce the
effectiveness of the vaccine. A table listing the minimum
interval acceptable between doses of vaccine is included in
Appendix A. If vaccine is given at an interval shorter than
the minimum—even by 1 day—the second dose should not be
counted.
In some cases, a scheduled dose of vaccine may not be given on
time. If this occurs, the dose should be given at the next visit. It
is not necessary to restart the series of any vaccine due to
extended intervals between doses. The only exception to
this rule is oral typhoid vaccine. In the case of oral typhoid, the
manufacturer recommends repeating the series if the interval
between any of the doses is longer than recommended.
Number of doses
General Rule
Live attenuated vaccines generally produce longlasting
immunity with a single dose.
Inactivated vaccines require multiple doses and may
require periodic boosting to maintain immunity.
For live injected vaccines, the first dose usually provides
protection. An additional does is given to ensure
seroconversion. For instance, 95% to 98% of recipients will
respond to a single dose of measles vaccine. The second dose

is given to assure that nearly 100% of persons are immune
(i.e., the second dose is “insurance"). Immunity following
live vaccines is long-lasting, and booster doses are not
necessary.
For inactivated vaccines, the first dose usually does not
provide protection. A protective immune response may
not develop until the second or third dose.
For inactivated vaccines, antibody titers may decrease (“wane")
below protective levels after a few years. This phenomenon is
most notable for tetanus and diphtheria. For these vaccines,
periodic “boosting" is required. An additional dose is given to
raise antibody back to protective levels.
Not all inactivated vaccines require boosting throughout life.
For example, Hib vaccine does not require boosting because
Hib disease is very rare in children older than 5 years of age.
Hepatitis B vaccine does not require boosting because of
immunologic memory to the vaccine and the long incubation
period of hepatitis B (which can produce an “autoboost").
Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
Vaccines are intended to produce active immunity to specific
antigens. An adverse reaction is an untoward effect
caused by a vaccine that is extraneous to the vaccine's
primary purpose of production of immunity. Adverse
reactions are also called vaccine side effects. A vaccine
adverse event refers to any adverse event that occurs
following vaccination. An adverse event could be a true
vaccine reaction, or just a coincidental event, with further
reseach needed to distinguish between them.
Vaccine adverse reactions fall into three general categories -
local, systemic, and allergic. Local reactions generally the
least severe and most frequent. Allergic reactions are the
most severe and least frequent.
The most common type of adverse reactions are local
reactions, such as pain, swelling, and redness at the site of
injection. Local reactions may occur in up to 50 percent of
vaccine doses, depending on the type of vaccine. Local
reactions are most common with inactivated vaccines,
particularly those, such as DTaP, that contain adjuvants.
Local adverse reactions generally occur within a few hours of
the injection and are usually mild and self limited. On rare
occasions, local reactions may be very exagerated or severe.
These are often referred to as hypersensitivity reactions,
although they are not allergic, as the term implies. These
reactions are also known as Arthus reactions, and are most
commonly seen with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Arthus
reactions are believed to be due to very high titers of
antibody, usually because of too many doses of toxoid.

frequency of systemic adverse events among vaccine and
placebo recipients show they are uncommon with inactivated

Systemic adverse reactions are more common following live
attenuated vaccines than inactivated vaccines. Live
attenuated vaccines must replicate in order to produce
immunity. The adverse reactions that follow live attenuated
vaccines, such as fever or rash represent symptoms produced
from that replication, and are similar to a mild form of the
natural disease. Systemic adverse reactions following live
vaccines are usually mild, and occur a week or two after the
vaccine was given (i.e., after an incubation period of the
vaccine virus).
Vaccine Adverse Reactions
• Local
s Systemic
• Allergic

component

A third type of vaccine adverse reaction is a severe allergic
reaction. The allergic reaction may be caused by the
vaccine antigen itself, or some other component of the
vaccine, such as cell culture material, stabilizer,
preservatives, or antibiotic used to inhibit bacterial growth.
Severe allergic reactions to vaccines may be life-
threatening. Fortunately, they are very rare, occurring at a
rate of less than one in half a million doses. The risk of an
allergic reaction may be minimized by good screening prior
to vaccination.
Reporting vaccine adverse events
From 1978 to 1990, the CDC conducted the Monitoring
System for Adverse Events Following Immunization
(MSAEFI) in the public sector. In 1990, MSAEFI was
replaced by the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System
(VAERS), which includes reporting from both public and
private sectors. Adverse events requiring medical attention
occurring within 30 days after receipt of a vaccine should be
reported to this system. The telephone number to call for
answers to questions and to obtain VAERS forms is (800)
822-7967.

GENERAL RECOWMAMENDATIONS OF IMMUNIZATION
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Contraindication
• A condition in a recipient that greatly
increases the chance of a serious
adverse event Contraindications and precautions to vaccination generally
dictate circumstances when vaccines will not be given. Most
contraindications and precautions are temporary and the
vaccine can be given at a later time.
Precaution
• A condition in a recipient that may
increase the chance of an adverse
event
A contraindication is a condition in a recipient that greatly
increases the chance of a serious adverse reaction. It is a
condition in the recipient of the vaccine, not with the vaccine
itself. If the vaccine were given in the presence of that
condition, the resulting adverse reaction could seriously
harm the recipient. For instance, administering influenza
vaccine to a person with a true anaphylactic allergy to egg
could cause serious illnes or death in the recipient. In
general, vaccines are never administered when a
contraindication condition is present.
• May compromise the ability of the
vaccine to produce immunity
A precaution is similar to a contraindication. A precaution
is a condition in a recipient that may increase the chance of a
serious adverse reaction, or that may compromise the ability
of the vaccine to produce immunity (such as administering
measles vaccine to a person with passive immunity to
measles from a blood transfusion). Injury could result, but
the chance of this happening is less than with a
contraindication. Under normal circumstances, vaccines are
deferred when a precaution condition is present. However,
situations may arise when the benefit of protection from the
vaccine outweighs the risk of an adverse reaction, and a
provider may decide to give the vaccine. For example,
prolonged crying or a high fever after a dose of whole cell or
acellular pertussis vaccine is considered a precaution to
giving subsequent doses of pertussis vaccine to a child. But
if the child were at high risk of pertussis infection (e.g., a
pertussis outbreak in the community), a provider may
choose to vaccinate the child and treat the adverse reaction
if it occurs. In this example, the benefit of protection from
the vaccine outweighs the harm potentially caused by the
vaccine.
There are very few true contraindication and precaution
conditions. Only two of these conditions are generally
considered to be permanent: severe allergy to a vaccine
component or following a prior dose of a vaccine, and
encephalopathy within 7 days of pertussis
vaccination.

Four conditions are considered permanent precautions to
further doses of pertussis-containing vaccine: temperature
>105°F, collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic
hyporesponsive episode), and persistent inconsolable crying
lasting 3 or more hours occurring within 48 hours of a dose,
or a seizure, with or without fever, occurring within 3 days of
a dose. Until additional information is available, a chronic
gastrointestinal condition (such as Hirschsprung's disease
or short-gut syndrome) is considered a permanent
precaution to rotavirus vaccine.
Two conditions are temporary contraindications to
vaccination with live vaccines: pregnancy and
immunosuppression. Two conditions are temporary
precautions to vaccination: moderate or severe acute
illness (all vaccines), and recent receipt of an antibody-
containing blood product (live injected vaccines only).
Allergy
A severe allergic reaction following a dose of vaccine will
virtually always contraindicate a subsequent dose of that
vaccine. Severe allergies are those which are mediated by
IgE, occur within minutes or hours of the vaccine, and
require medical attention. Examples of severe allergic
reactions are generalized urticaria (hives), swelling of the
mouth and throat, difficulty breathing, wheezing,
hypotension, or shock. With appropriate screening these
reactions are very rare following vaccination.
Persons may be allergic to the vaccine antigen, animal
protein, antibiotics, preservatives, or stabilizers. The most
common animal protein allergen is egg protein found in
vaccines prepared using embryonated chicken eggs (e.g.,
yellow fever and influenza vaccines). Ordinarily, persons
who are able to eat eggs or egg products safely can receive
these vaccines; persons with histories of anaphylactic or
anaphylactic-like allergy to eggs or egg proteins should not.
Asking persons whether they can eat eggs without adverse
effects is a reasonable way to screen for those who might be
at risk from receiving yellow fever, and influenza vaccines.
Several recent studies have shown that children who have a
history of severe allergy to eggs rarely have reactions to MMR
vaccine. This is probably because measles and mumps vaccine
viruses are both grown in chick embryofibroblasts, not actually in
eggs. It appears now that it may be gelatin, not egg, that causes
allergic reactions to MMR. As a result, in 1997, ACIP removed
severe egg allergy as a contraindication to measles and mumps

without prior skin testing.
Pregnancy
The concern about vaccinating pregnant women is with
infection of the fetus, and is theoretical. There is no
evidence that any live vaccine (including rubella) causes
birth defects. See the rubella chapter for more
information. However, since the theoretical possibility
exists, live vaccines should not be given to pregnant
women (except OPV, in some situations).
Since inactivated vaccines cannot replicate, they cannot
cause fetal infection. Inactivated vaccines should be
administered to pregnant women for whom they are
indicated.
- Immunosuppression
Immunosuppression
Disease Live vaccines can cause severe or fatal reactions in
immunosuppressed persons due to uncontrolled replication
of the vaccine virus, particularly oral polio vaccine virus (and
rarely measles vaccine virus). Immunosuppressed persons
should not be given live vaccines for this reason (except
measles vaccine in HIV-infected persons — see next section).
Inactivated vaccines cannot replicate, so are safe to use in
immunosuppressed persons. However, response to the
vaccine may be decreased.
• Congenital immunodeficiency
• Leukemia or lymphoma
• Generalized malignancy

immunosuppression. Persons with congenital immunodeficiency,

vaccines. Live vaccines can be given after chemotherapy has been
discontinued for at least 3 months. Persons receiving large doses
of corticosteroids should not receive live vaccines. This would
include persons receiving 20 milligrams of prednisone daily or
more than 2 milligrams of prednisone per kilogram of body weight

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF //M/MUNIZATION
Aerosolized steroids, such as inhalers for asthma, alternate day,
rapidly tapering, and short (<14 days) high dose schedules,
topical formulations, and physiologic replacement schedules are
not contraindications to vaccination.
Inactivated vaccines are not contraindicated for
immunosuppressed persons. However, response to the vaccine
may be poor. A relatively functional immune system is required in
order to develop an immune response to a vaccine. So an
immunosuppressed person may not be protected, even if the
vaccine has been given. Additional recommendations for
vaccination of immunosuppressed persons are detailed in the
General Recommendations on Immunization and in a specific
Altered Immunocompetence ACIP statement.
HIV infection
Persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may
have no symptoms, or may be severely immunosuppressed. In
general, the same vaccination recommendations apply as with
other types of immunosuppression. Live virus vaccines are usually
contraindicated, and inactivated vaccines are not contraindicated.
Oral polio vaccine should not be given to a person with HIV
infection or AIDS, or to a child whose household contact has HIV
infection or AIDS. Varicella vaccine should not be given to a
person known to be infected with HIV, but is recommended for
healthy persons whose household contact has HIV infection.
Rotavirus vaccine should not be given to an infant whose mother is
HIV-positive until tests for HIV infection in the infant are negative
at 2 months or older.
Measles can be a very severe illness in persons with HIV infection
and is often associated with complications and death. Therefore,
measles vaccine (as combination MMR vaccine) is recommended
for persons with HIV infection who are asymptomatic or mildly
immunosuppressed. However, persons with severe
immunosuppression due to HIV infection should not receive
measles vaccine or MMR.

• Allergies to products not in vaccine
• Family history unrelated to
Immunosuppression
• Need for TB skin testing
• Need for multiple vaccines
Moderate or severe acute illness
There is no evidence that a concurrent acute illness reduces
vaccine efficacy or increases vaccine adverse events. The
concern is that an adverse event (particularly fever)
following vaccination could complicate the management of a
severely ill person. If a person has a moderate or severe
acute illness, vaccination with both live and inactivated
vaccines should be delayed until the illness has improved.
Mild, common illnesses (such as otitis media, upper
respiratory infections, colds, and diarrhea) are NOT
contraindications to vaccination.
Recent blood products
Blood products may interfere with the replication of live
injected vaccine viruses. Recent receipt of blood products
is a precaution to MMR and varicella vaccines. OPV and
oral typhoid are not affected by circulating antibody, and
blood products in the United States do not contain enough
yellow fever antibody to interfere with replication of that
vaccine.
Varicella and MMR vaccines should be given 14 days prior
to the blood product, or delayed until the antibody has
degraded (see Table 8 in Appendix A). If MMR is given
sooner than the minimum interval shown, the recipient
should be tested for immunity or the dose repeated after
the appropriate interval.
Inactivated vaccines are not substantially affected by
circulating antibody from blood products and are not
contraindicated.
Invalid Contraindications to Vaccination
Some health care providers inappropriately consider certain
conditions or circumstances to be true contraindications or
precautions to vaccinations. Such conditions or
circumstances are known as invalid contraindications, and
result in missed opportunities to administer needed
vaccines. Some of the most common invalid
contraindications are minor illnesses, conditions related to
pregnancy and breast-feeding, allergies that are not
anaphylactic in nature, and certain aspects of the patient's
family history.
Minor illness
Children with mild acute illnesses, such as low-grade
fever, upper respiratory infection, colds, otitis media, and
mild diarrhea, can and should be vaccinated.

GENERAL RECO/M/MENDATIONS OF //M/MUNIZATION
Several large studies have shown that young children with
URI, otitis media, diarrhea, and/or fever respond to
measles vaccine as well as those without these conditions.
These large studies refute the results of an earlier small
study (Krober, JAMA 1991) which suggested that minor
infections such as URIs might impair the response to
measles vaccine. Further, there is no evidence that mild
diarrhea reduces the success of polio or rotavirus
immunization of infants in this country.
Low-grade fever is not a contraindication to immunization.
Temperature measurement is not necessary before
immunization if the infant or child does not appear ill and
the parent does not say the child is currently ill.
Antibiotic therapy
Antibiotics do not have an effect on the immune response to
a vaccine. No commonly used antibiotic or antiviral will
inactivate a live virus vaccine.
Disease exposure or convalescence
If a child is not severely ill, he or she should be vaccinated.
There is no evidence that either disease exposure or
convalescence will affect the response to a vaccine or
increase the likelihood of an adverse event.
Pregnancy in the household or breast-feeding
All vaccines, including live vaccines (MMR, OPV, rotavirus,
varicella, and yellow fever) can be given to infants or
children with pregnant household contacts, as well as to
breast-feeding infants.
Measles and mumps vaccine viruses produce a
noncommunicable infection, and are not transmitted to
household contacts. Rubella vaccine virus has been shown to
be shed in breast milk, but transmission to an infant has
rarely been documented (rubella is not transmitted by
mouth). Transmission of varicella vaccine virus is
uncommon, and most women are immune from prior
chickenpox. Oral polio vaccine virus is shed and can spread,
but pregnant contacts are at no greater risk than other
household contacts in this situation, and OPV has not been
shown to cause fetal defects.
Breast-feeding does not decrease the response to routine
childhood vaccines, including OPV and rotavirus vaccines.
Breast-feeding also does not extend or improve passive
immunity to vaccine-preventable disease provided by
maternal antibody.
Invalid Contra indications to
Vaccination
Minor Illness
Examples:
• low-grade fever
• upper respiratory infection
• otitis media
• mild diarrhea
• Only one study has suggested
decreased efficacy of measles vaccine
in children with URI.
• Findings not replicated by multiple prior
and subsequent studies.
• No evidence of increased adverse
events.

GENERAL RECO/M/MENDATIONS OF //M/MUNIZATION
Premature birth
Vaccines should be started on schedule based on the child's
chronological age. Premature infants have been shown to
respond adequately to vaccines used in infancy.
If a premature infant is still hospitalized, OPV and rotavirus
vaccines should generally not be used. This could lead to
contact transmission of vaccine viruses to other high-risk
infants.
Routine hepatitis B vaccination should not be given until an
infant weighs 2 kilograms or more. Infants born to women
who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive (from acute or
chronic infection) should be vaccinated and given hepatitis B
immune globulin regardless of body weight.
Nonspecificallergies, allergies to antibiotics not in
vaccine, non-severe egg allergies, and allergies to
duck antigens
Infants and children with non-specific allergies, duck or
feather allergy, allergy to penicillin, relatives with allergies,
and children taking allergy shots can and should be
immunized. No vaccine available in the United States
contains duck antigen or penicillin.
Non-anaphylactic allergy to vaccine component
Anaphylactic allergy to a vaccine component (such as egg or
neomycin) is a true contraindication to vaccination. Non-
anaphylactic allergy to a vaccine constituent is not a
contraindication to that vaccine.
Family history of adverse events unrelated to
immunosuppression, or family history of seizures or
SIDS
The only family history that is relevant in the decision to
vaccinate a child is immunosuppression, and only for oral
polio virus vaccine. OPV should not be given to a child with
a personal or family history of immunosuppression, because
the vaccine virus could spread to the immunosuppressed
COntact.
Need or requirement for tuberculosis skin test (PPD)
Infants and children who need TB skin tests can and should
be immunized. All vaccines, including MMR, can be given on
the same day as a TB skin test, or any time after a TB
skin test is applied. For most vaccines, there are no TB
skin test timing restrictions at all.


## p. 23 (#35) ##############################################

GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF IMMUNIZATION 23
MMR vaccine may decrease the response to a TB skin test,
potentially causing a false negative response in someone
who actually has an infection with tuberculosis while MMR
can be given the same day as a TB skin test, if MMR has
been given and one or more days have elapsed, in most
situations it is recommended to wait 4-6 weeks before giving
a routine TB skin test. No information on the effect of
varicella vaccine on a TB skin test is available. Until such
information is available, it is prudent to apply rules for
spacing measles vaccine and TB skin testing to varicella
vaccine.
Screening for Contraindications and
Precautions to Vaccination
The key to preventing serious adverse reactions is screening.
Every person who administers vaccines should screen
every patient for contraindications and precautions
before giving the vaccine dose. Effective screening isn't
difficult or complicated and can be accomplished with just
a few questions.
How is your child (or how are you) today?
This question screens for concurrent moderate or acute
illness. If the child has been examined, this question may
not be necessary, or may have already been asked.
Does your child have any allergies to any food or
medication?
A severe allergy to a vaccine component is a contraindication
to vaccination, so this question must always be asked. It
maybe more time-efficient to inquire about allergies in a
generic way (i.e., any food or medication), rather than to
inquire about specific vaccine components. Most parents
will not be familiar with minor components of vaccine, but
they should know if the child has had an allergic reaction
to a food or medication severe enough to require medical
attention.
Did the child have any problems after his or her last
shots?
This open-ended question explores for allergic reactions to
previous doses, and for conditions following pertussis
vaccine that may be precautions to additional doses, such as
high fever or a hypotonic episode.
Does the child have any problems with his or her
immune system? This question will help identify children
with immunodeficiency who generally should not receive live
attenuated vaccines, particularly oral polio vaccine.
Screening Questions
• How is your child today?
• Allergies to food or medication?
• Any problem after last shots?
Screening Questions
• Problems with immune system?
• Anyone in household with
immune problems?
• Blood products in last year?
• Pregnant?




## p. 24 (#36) ##############################################

GENERAL RECOWMMENDATIONS OF //M/MUNIZATIOW
Does anyone in your household have a problem with
their immune system?
Oral polio vaccine should not be given to a healthy child who
has household contact with someone who is
immunodeficient. Rotavirus vaccine should not be given to
an infant whose mother is HIV-positive until the infant
has been determined not to be infected.
Has the child received any blood products in the last
year, like a transfusion, or gamma globulin?
This question helps identify precautions for live attenuated
MMR and varicella vaccines, which should not be given to
persons who have received passive antibody in the last few
months. The question may also expose unreported illnesses
that might not have been revealed in earlier questions.
Are you pregnant, or trying to become pregnant?
This question should be asked of all adolescent and adult
women. MMR and varicella vaccines should not be given to
women known to be pregnant or for up to 3 months prior to
pregnancy. It is not necessary to inquire about pregnancy in
household contacts because a pregnant woman in the
household is not a contraindication for administration of any
vaccine. ACIP does not recommend pregnancy testing prior
to administration of any vaccine.
Every person should be screened for contraindications
and precautions prior to vaccination. Standardized
screening forms for both children and adults, developed by
the Immunization Action Coalition, are included in Appendix
A.

Chapter
Immunization Strategies for Hedlth
Core ProCfices Ond Providers
The Need to Focus on Strategies to Increase
Immunization Levels
Vaccine-preventable disease rates are at their lowest level
ever. In 1997, only 138 cases of measles, 181 cases of
rubella, 4 cases of diphtheria , 50 cases of tetanus, and no
wild polio were reported in the U.S. Given these
immunization successes, why is there continued interest in
strategies to increase immunization levels? The three
chief reasons relate to concerns about current
immunization levels, costs, and the sustainability of the
immunization delivery system.
Disease levels, while they are one of the chief outcomes of
interest, are a late indicator of the soundness of the
immunization system. Immunization levels are a better
indicator for determining if there is a problem with
immunization delivery.
Concerns about U.S. immunization levels include:
* Childhood immunization rates are still suboptimal.
For example, in 1996-97 only 81% of children 19 to 35
months of age had received all four doses of DTP/DTaP
vaccine.
* For other age groups, immunization rates are
considerably lower. Only 65% of people over 65 years
of age received the flu vaccine in 1997 and 45% of
seniors had ever received pneumococcal vaccine.
* Economic and racial disparities exist. Low-income
and minority children and adults are at greater risk for
under-immunization. “Pockets of need” exist in our
nation's inner cities.
* Uptake is lagging for some antigens. For example,
in 1997 only 26% of children had received varicella
vaccine by their second birthday.
Why focus on strategies to
increase immunization?
• Immunization levels are not
optimal
• Cost effectiveness is a concern
• Sustainability is a concern

28. //M/MUNIZATION STRATEG/ES FOR HEALTH CARE PRACTICES AND PROVIDERS
Matching Strategies to
Existing Problems
• Value of a strategy depends on:
- implementation
- potential effectiveness
- how well matched to existing
problems
• Improvements in childhood immunization rates
have tapered off. In 1997 childhood immunization
rates were notably different from those in 1996 only for
hepatitis B and varicella. To be sure, it is easier to
increase immunization levels from, for example, 55% to
65% than from 75% to 85%. As we approach our national
immunization goals, we will need a clearer understanding
of effective immunization strategies.
Cost effectiveness is also of great concern. We need to
know which strategies increase immunization levels with the
least expenditure so they can be prioritized.
Sustainable systems for vaccinating children, adolescents,
and adults must be crafted. It has been recognized that high
immunization rates cannot rest upon one-time or short-term
efforts. There is interest in understanding strategies to
increase immunization levels in order to create lasting,
effective immunization delivery systems.
Matching strategies to existing problems
Many available strategies work to increase immunization,
but some do not. The value of a strategy depends upon its
potential effectiveness, its implementation, and how well
it is matched to existing problems. Some strategies do not
work because they are ill-conceived from the beginning.
Some do not work because they are implemented badly.
Some are simply misdirected - they address the wrong
problems.
There are strategies well-suited to the problem of low demand
among clients for particular vaccines. The effectiveness of
some of these has been documented (e.g., school entry laws)
but, the effectiveness of others has been less well documented.
Similarly, there are strategies well-suited to the problem of
poor access to immunization services (e.g., reducing costs,
WIC, home visiting) and their effectiveness is documented.
When considering what new strategies to implement, we
must carefully match proposed solutions to current problems.
At present in the U.S., most people have sufficient interest in
and access to health care and are seen, at least periodically,
in health care systems. Those who remain unvaccinated
do so largely because health care practices and providers
do not always perform optimally in delivering vaccines. So
this chapter focuses on immunization strategies for
health care practices and providers.
The purpose of the approach discussed below is to move
health care personnel from a state of unawareness about the
problem (low immunization rates in their practice) to one in
which they are aware, concerned, and knowledgeable;
motivated to change; ready to try new behaviors (strategies);

and capable of sustaining the new behavior.
The acronym used by the National Immunization Program
(NIP) for this approach is AFDX: Assessment of the
immunization coverage of public and private providers;
Feedback of diagnostic information to improve service
delivery; Incentives (or recognition) for improved
performance; and eXchange of information among providers.
After discussing each of these steps, the chapter highlights
specific practice-based strategies and details where to find
more resources on this topic.
The AFIX Approach
Overview
Routine assessment and feedback of vaccination rates obtained
at the provider site — whether public or private — is one of the
most effective strategies for achieving high, sustainable vaccine
coverage. Georgia was the first state to implement AFIX in all
public clinics. From 1986 to 1994, median series-completion
rates among Georgia's public clinics for 4 DTPs, 3 polio
vaccines, and 1 measles-containing vaccine (the 4:3:1 series) at
24 months of age increased from 40% to 89%. In a recent
analysis of the Georgia public clinic experience, several
factors were found to have significant positive influence on
immunization rates: the lead nurse participated in the
feedback session after assessments and received an incentive
to raise the clinic's immunization coverage; the site used a
phone system for patient reminders, used WIC voucher
incentives and conducted home visits for vaccine defaulters.
The Georgia experience is not unique. Other states and
localities that have used AFIX strategies for three or more
years have shown gradual and consistent improvement in
public sector coverage levels. In a private sector study, the
median up-to-date coverage for 4:3:1 at 24 months of age
improved in participating practices from 78% at baseline to
87% at the second assessment.
AFIX enjoys wide support. One of the Standards of Pediatric
Immunization Practices issued by the National Vaccine
Advisory Committee (NVAC) calls upon providers to do semi-
annual assessments of coverage levels. In 1996, following the
success of the Georgia AFIX strategy, a congressional mandate
was passed which stated that all grantees receiving federal
funds for vaccination programs were required to conduct
annual assessments of vaccination rates in all their public
health clinics. The Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) issued a statementendorsing the AFIX
process and recommending that it be used by all public and
private providers. In 1997, 6% of all private practices, 37% of
Community/MigrantHealth Centers, and 67% of all public
health department clinics had an immunization assessment.

Special Characteristics of AFIX

Assessment
e Evaluation of medical records to

a defined group
e Assessment increases awareness
How To Assess
• Tools for assessment
- CASA
- Make Every Visit Count
• Help for assessment and
feedback
AFIX has some important characteristics that deserve
emphasis.
• Focus on outcomes — AFIX starts with assessment.
Assessment data helps pinpoint the processes that
need to be initiated or remedied. The AFIX approach
does not start with a list of strategies to be tried
randomly.
• Focus on providers — AFIX focuses on changing
health care provider behavior. Strategies implemented
do not have to be of a sweeping governmental scope, nor
do they need to be attempts to change the hearts and
minds of every individual client.
• Both personal and technological — AFIX depends on
the whole-hearted, intense, and subtle union of technology
(in the form of assessment methodology and diagnostics)
with art (in the form of persuasive feedback, moving
incentives, and stimulating exchange of information). Both
the message and its delivery are critical to the success of the
AFIX approach. An artless delivery of the technologic
assessment is mind numbing; a presentation on
strategies without practice-based data is easily
dismissed.
Assessment
Assessment refers to the evaluation of medical records to
ascertain the immunization level for a defined group of
people. This step, along with feedback of the results, is
essential because, while most health care providers share
the vision for high immunization rates, they don't see their
own practice's immunization rates for what they really are.
This lack of awareness has been documented in several
studies showing that pediatricians greatly over-estimated
the proportion of fully immunized children in their
practices. Assessment increases awareness.
CDC has two tools for clinic assessment: the Clinic
Assessment Software Application (CASA), a
computerized assessment tool, and “Make Every Visit
Count”, a manual self-assessment tool.
CASA can be downloaded from the NIP website (listed in the
resource directory) or obtained on diskette from NIP. It is easy
to use and it usually takes four to eight hours to enter the
data for a practice. There are many special features, including:
* error-checking to ensure that the immunization dates
occurred after the date of birth, before the review date,
and after the previous doses;
:

IMMUNIZATIONSTRATEGIES FOR HEALTH CARE PRACTICES AND PROVIDERS
• capability of capturing useful, non-immunization
information by including data fields such as WIC, AFDC,
Head Start, EPSDT, HEDIS information, and date of last
visit;
• capability of exporting data to other software
applications by saving to an ASCII text or dBase file;
• ability to generate a mailing list and a reminder or recall
letter/postcard; and
• an easy-to-use sampling feature which shows the
number of records that should be reviewed in order to
achieve a statistically relevant estimate of vaccination
levels.
CASA provides detailed reports on the specific diagnosis of the
problem, for example, whether record keeping and
documentation are adequate, whether children start their
series on time, whether and when patients drop out of the
system, whether recall is used effectively, and whether
vaccines are given simultaneously. This important diagnostic
capability of CASA facilitates a focused — rather than a
“laundry list” — approach to change at the site. CASA can
be used for adolescent and adult practices and the
diagnostic capabilities are being expanded for these groups.
Make Every Visit Count is a manual self-assessment tool.
It is also available from CDC NIP on the AFIX web site and
Appendix B. It's easy to use and requires 3 to 4 hours to
enter the data for a practice. It does not require a
computer. Unlike CASA, it does not have the special
features described, does not provide detailed reports on
the specific diagnosis, and cannot be used for adolescents
or adults.
Other assessment tools exist, but these are not used for the
assessment of individual practices (e.g., the National Health
Interview Survey, the National Immunization Survey) or do
not use the ACIP measurement criteria (e.g., HEDIS).
Feedback
Feedback
Feedback is the process of informing immunization providers
about their performance in delivering vaccines to a defined
client population. The work of assessment is of no use
unless the results are fed back to people who can make a
change. An insider (e.g., the office manager) may give
feedback to the providers, but often it is useful to have the
feedback from a respected outsider. Assessment together
with feedback creates the awareness necessary for
behavior change.

## p. 32 (#44) ##############################################

IMMUNIZATIONSTRATEGIES FOR HEALTH CARE PRACTICES AND PROVIDERS
How to Provide Feedback
• To all who can make a change
• With feeling and precision
• Without judgment
• With confidentiality as
appropriate
• As a challenge
Strong evidence of the positive effects of provider feedback
has been shown:
* in a range of settings (private practice, managed care,
public and community health centers, academic, and VA
settings)
• for a range of providers (resident and staff physicians,
non-physician providers, internal medicine, family
medicine, and general practice)
* for adults and children (although there are no
completed studies to date on adolescents)
* and for most universally-recommended antigens.
Feed back the data to everyone who can make a change.
The data should be presented to the entire team of people
who can make a change — not only to policy makers, but
also to policy implementers. In a practice, this includes
the medical and nursing staff as well as the office manager
and receptionist. It is best if they are all presented with
the data simultaneously to minimize inter-professional
blaming.
Feed back the data with feeling. Feedback is not a pale,
passionless out-pouring of data. Well-designed feedback is
tantalizing and challenging. The most effective “AFIXers”
are those emotionally involved with the “FIX.”
Feed back the data with precision. Data should not be sent to
the health care providers without explanation or analysis.
Within a CASA Summary Report there are data on
immunization levels and there are more detailed diagnostic
data. Diagnostics isolate a single component of immunization
delivery and serve as clues to the source of the systemic
problem. They include, for example, data on the percent of
patient records that reflect clients who are “lost” (i.e., eligible
for vaccine, but not seen in the past year), who were not given
all needed vaccines simultaneously on the last vaccination
visit, or who “dropped-out” of the immunization schedule.
For more information on CASA reports, see “How to Read a
CASA Summary Report: Just for Starters” in Appendix B.
Because of the diagnostic capabilities of CASA, one does not
need to “fish around,” asking a practice if they implement
this strategy or that. For example, a practice with a 50%
drop-off rate need not be asked if they have an effective
recall system. We know by the data what the office is (not)
doing or how (in)effectively they are doing it. Once you have
established the accuracy of the method, the only issue that
remains to be discussed is how to best improve in those
specific areas that are below the norm.

Feed back the data as data, not as judgment. There are no
bad people, only bad systems. That is, the problem is not
the individuals employed at the site, it is their
immunization delivery system. You need not scold the
people, just help them improve the system.
Feed back the data with respect for confidentiality. The
acceptance of an outside assessor depends upon trust that
the data will be used in a pre-arranged, circumscribed way.
Don't violate that trust.
Feed back the data as a challenge. The over-riding
dedication to confidentiality should never be
compromised. However, in some circumstances, offices
agree to allow their data to be used publicly, either in
association with their name or not. In these specific
circumstances, the fires of friendly competition can be
fanned. Never underestimate an American's desire to
compete. By comparing an office's immunization rates
with national goals or, preferably, with the rates of peers,
competitive spirit can be stirred. Those at the top struggle
to keep or attain first place; those at the bottom scramble
to avoid last place. Graphic representation of relative
standing is useful, as is wide public dissemination of the
assessment results, when appropriate.
Incentives and Recognition
People who enter the health care profession are likely to be
motivated by a desire to prevent disease and its
complications. Immunization is primarily dependent upon
this intrinsic motivation. However, as a supplement,
extrinsic rewards, or incentives, are often useful. It should
be noted that incentives will not overcome significant
barriers (e.g., if your practice loses $15 every time you
vaccinate someone, framed certificates of appreciation are
unlikely to sway you to immunize).
An incentive is something that incites or has a tendency to
incite to determination or action. This necessitates pre-
arranged performance standards (“if I do X, I will get Y").
Recognition is special notice or attention, a surprisingly
powerful motivator. Pre-arranged performance standards are
not necessary for recognition. When a recognition program
has been in place for awhile, people begin to expect it, so it
becomes, in a sense, an incentive program.
What makes an incentive useful? Incentive programs should:
* Reward achievement on the basis of a fair, credible,
well-communicated assessment.
• Be positive; the motivating effect of carrots usually
exceeds the motivating effect of sticks.

IMMUNIZATIONSTRATEGIES FOR HEALTH CARE PRACTICES AND PROVIDERS
eXchange of Information
• Allows access to more experience
than an individual can accumulate
• Motivates improvement
• Coordinates resourses and efforts
• Reward achievement in a timely fashion.
• Offer something the individual values. Not everyone
values the same things, so discuss the incentives in advance
of kick-off. Don't forget that professional recognition is
often surprisingly motivating. Food is (almost) always
motivating. Money is "iffy': it may be motivating, but it may
be insulting or encourage cheating.
• Be aimed to all levels of involved personnel (e.g.,
clerical and nursing staff).
• Be publicized. Don't let their light stay under the bushel
basket: Let it shine. When a professional shares his/her
success story with another professional, you make two
friends. Having it in writing seems quite powerful.
• Reflect desired outcomes (e.g., immunization rates)
or process (e.g., putting a reminder system in place) or
both. “Most improved” is a useful category to keep
everyone in the running.
• Be related to mission (e.g., the reward for letting us
do a CASA is that, at the end, we'll give you a list of
children in your practice who are behind on
immunizations).
• NOT dictate methods. Leave the innovation about
“how to” up to the practice. Of course, you can be there
as a resource if they have questions or want
suggestions.
• NOT be stale (“Been there, won that.”)
Inexpensive incentives are usually more sustainable. You
may be able to shift the costs of an incentive program to
other organizations. For example, professional
organizations may donate newsletter space or time for an
award ceremony during their meeting. Service
organizations may donate money, volunteers, or printing
costs. Businesses could donate food, gifts, or gift
certificates. An elected official or his/her spouse could
give out the awards at a meeting. Finally, free continuing
education credit could be offered at meetings during which
the assessment program is discussed.
eXchange of information
When health care providers have moved from being unaware of
their site's low immunization rates to being aware, concerned,
and knowledgeable as well as motivated to change, they are then
ready to try new strategies. The exchange of information among
health care providers is an important next step because peer-
education is the best way to learn what new strategies to try.

Why should the exchange of information among providers be
supported? This exchange helps to educate, motivate, and
coordinate in a way that is powerful because it is
believable and relevant.
• Education. The exchange of information gives people
access to more experience than they have time to
accumulate individually. People learn from their peers
which strategies work and which don't. The educational
aspect of these conversations can dispel myths and
negative attitudes (e.g., inflated coverage estimates, the
number of shots that parents will accept), clarify true
contraindications, and foster better understanding of
assessment data as a diagnostic tool. During the cross-
pollination, some new ideas may even be generated.
• Motivation. Public acknowledgements of one
provider's success inform other providers of the
shifting norm. This stimulates competition and
motivates improvement which, in turn, establishes the
need for follow-up assessments. The exchange of
information about practices' relative immunization rates
is an incentive to change.
• Coordination. Once the participants' common mission to
prevent disease has been clarified, people may begin to see
how they can use and share common resources, improve
communication within and between practices, and
possibly even coordinate with the registry and public
health department. Increased communication often
leads to improved rapport.
What forums are appropriate for exchange among providers?
Meetings of health care providers may be state-wide,
regional, or local. They may be convened solely with the
practice members—physicians, nurses, office managers, and
clerical staff—or with sections of professional organizations
such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, American
Academy of Family Physicians, American Nursing
Association, or the American Public Health Association.
Meetings of health care providers within a managed care
plan are another excellent setting for this kind of
exchange. Award ceremonies serve as a particularly
pleasant and supportive forum to open the exchange.
What type of information should be exchanged among
providers? Information on both immunization levels and on
the process of increasing immunization levels should be
exchanged. Sharing information on immunization levels--
whether limited (e.g., coverage levels, grouped by the type
of service to increase comparability) or more extensive
(e.g., specific antigen coverage levels, drop-off levels, non-
simultaneous vaccination levels)—will keep the group
focused on the desired endpoint. Sharing data on the
eXchange of Information
• Choose the appropriate forum for
exchange of information
• Exchange information on both
immunization levels and process of
increasing levels
e Peer reports are usually more
influential than official reports

process will confirm that providers are establishing
sustainable systems. If awards are given, a category for
“most improved” keeps even late bloomers in the running.
Peer reports are usually more influential than official
reports. Peer reports on their own successful
documentation methods, vaccination practices, and office
protocols are often interesting. Discussions of processes
used in practices to educate staff and streamline
procedures are also useful. Official information on true
vaccine contraindications, ACIP recommendations, and the
Pediatric Standards should supplement peer reports, but
they are often too dry to stand alone. Testimonial success
stories are useful to show that, while we all start out
flawed, immunization redemption is an attainable goal.
Indeed, almost all practices can be made better by better
practices.
Better Practices
What are the strategies that lead to high immunization
levels in a practice? In this section we will discuss well-
studied strategies that are applicable within most public and
private sector practices. Additionally, we will discuss some
strategies that simply enjoy tremendous intuitive appeal
(e.g., good immunization records). The strategies are
summarized under the following headings:
• Records that are accurate, understandable, and available
• Recommendations to accept the vaccine; reinforcement
of the need to return
• Reminder and recall messages to patients
• Reminder and recall messages to providers
• Reduction of missed opportunities
• Reduction of barriers to immunization within the practice
It has been noted anecdotally that many health care
practices that successfully implement these strategies do so
because there is an Immunization Champion among them.
Motivation courses through the arteries and veins of
Immunization Champions. Thus it is that they find a way.
Records that are accurate, understandable, and
available
Easy-to-read immunization records that are available at the
time of the visit are essential. Adult medical records often
lack a front sheet that reflects the important preventive
services. Pediatric records often have a front sheet from
which one cannot, at a glance, assess age-dependent
immunization status. Putting in place a system that ensures
the front sheet is kept current also helps.

//MMUNIZATIONSTRATEGIES FOR HEALTH CARE PRACTICES AND PROVIDERS
The active medical records must reflect who is actually in
the practice. Charts of people who have moved or are going
elsewhere for services should be clearly marked accordingly or
removed. Conversely, charts should not be archived simply
because a patient has not presented for a prolonged time.
Patients often receive vaccines at more than one provider
office, so communication between these offices is needed to
produce complete and accurate immunization records.
Specifically, it is important for school-based, public health,
and community-based immunization sites to communicate
with primary care personnel through quick and reliable
methods (e.g., telephone, fax, and, if possible, email).
Someday immunization registries may make this
communication seamless. We should work toward, but not
wait for this day to implement efficient communication
between vaccine providers. Unfortunately, the effectiveness
of patient-held records on immunization rates is difficult to
estimate because of insufficient and inconsistent data.
Recommendations to accept the vaccine;
reinforcement of the need to return
The recommendation of a health care provider is a powerful
motivator. One study demonstrated that when the health care
provider's opinion of influenza vaccine was positive, even adults
whose initial opinion of influenza vaccination was negative
were likely to receive the vaccine. Similarly, other work has
shown that parents of pediatric patients are very likely to
follow vaccination recommendation of the child's doctor.
It has been found that, irrespective of true immunization status,
most parents believe their child is fully vaccinated. Parents may
not have been told or may not have understood that return visits
were necessary. Anecdotally, patients often find it useful to have
the next appointment date in hand upon departure from the
current visit. As a supplement to this, the timing of the return
visit can be linked to some calendar event (e.g., “Return for your
next flu vaccine in a year, right before Halloween.” “Your child
will need her next set of vaccines in two months. That's her 6-
month birthday...right after Valentine's day.")
Reminder and recall messages to patients
Definitions. Patient reminders and recall are messages
to patients or their parents that recommended
immunizations are due soon (reminders) or past due
(recall). The messages vary in their level of
personalization and specificity and in their medium (e.g.,
postcard, letter, telephone).
The effectiveness of patient reminders and recall.
Over the past 20 years, many studies of the effectiveness of
mail or telephone appointment reminders/recall have
shown consistently important increases in patient

IMMUNIZATION STRATEGIES FOR HEALTH CARE PRACTICES AND PROVIDERS
Reminders and Recall to Patients
• Reminders and recall are effective
• Do not have to be expensive,
elaborate, or computerized
• Support for wide-spread usage
• May increase utilization of other
preventive measures
compliance for vaccination as well as a variety of other
scheduled health visits. Generally, mail and telephone
reminders are equally effective.
Costs. Many health care providers have been reluctant to
institute aggressive reminder/recall systems because of
perceived costs. Tracking systems that generate reminder
and recall messages do not have to be expensive, elaborate,
or computerized. A card-file box with weekly dividers can
work as a tickler system.
In many provider settings, the costs of establishing an
aggressive notification system may be minimized by the
use of automated telephone dialing technology. In a recent
trial conducted by CDC NIP and the Colorado
Immunization Program, computer-generated telephone
calls and letters resulted in a 14% increase in
immunization coverage at a cost of $5.37 per child after
start-up.
Support for and wide-spread usage of patient
reminders and recall. One of the Standards for Pediatric
Immunization Practices calls upon providers to develop and
implement aggressive tracking systems that will both
remind parents of upcoming immunizations and recall
children who are overdue. CDC NIP has collaborated with
the ACIP to develop and publish a statement in the MMWR
supporting the use of reminder/recall systems by all
providers. CDC NIP has provided state and local health
departments with ongoing technical support to assist them
in implementing reminder and recall systems in public and
private provider sites.
A 1997 survey of federally-funded immunization grantees
revealed that 85% had some form of reminder/recall
systems operating in most of their public clinics. That
survey showed 4,312 local health department sites in 51
states and municipalities were conducting reminder/recall
activities; 716 of these sites were using automated dialing
technology as a basis for aggressive tracking systems. In
the private sector, CDC NIP found 1,536 providers
conducting reminder/recall activities, 686 of whom were
using automated systems.
Immunization and beyond: additional benefits of
patient recall and reminder systems. Three trials
conducted by CDC NIP and the Georgia Department of
Human Resources have demonstrated that computer-
generated telephone reminders and recall messages, in
addition to positively affecting the “on-time” rate of
immunizations, bring a significant number of children who
have dropped-out back into the public health delivery
system. Studies in the private sector show a key benefit of
patient reminder/recall systems is that they increase
utilization of other preventive measures. This is very

exciting: we are not improving one preventive measure at
a cost to the others. When we institute patient reminder
and recall systems for immunization, we increase
tuberculosis, lead, and anemia screening. Improvements
in a system, like most vaccine-preventable diseases, are
contagious.
Reminderand recall messages to providers
Provider reminders and recall messages are communications
from health care personnel (or computers) to health care
providers that, for individual clients, routine immunizations are
due soon (reminders) or past due (recall). Provider reminder/
recall is different from “Feedback” in which the provider
receives a message about overall immunization levels for a
group of clients. Examples of reminder/recall messages include:
• a computer-generated list that notifies a provider of the
children past-due for vaccines who are to be seen
during that clinic session,
• a red note “No Pneumococcal Vaccine on Record” that a
receptionist stamps on a senior's chart where the nurse
will write the vital signs,
• an “Immunization Due” clip that a nurse attaches to the
chart of an adolescent who has not had hepatitis B vaccine.
To be effective, the information must be conveyed to the
provider before or at the time of the patient's office visit.
Some offices have found that it is productive to have one
knowledgeable and determined “gate keeper” who checks
and updates immunizations at each visit.
Provider reminders and recall systems have been found to be
effective in increasing immunization levels when used alone
or in combination with related strategies such as provider
education or patient recall.
Reduction of missed opportunities to vaccinate
Definitions. A missed opportunity is a health care
encounter in which a person is eligible to receive a
vaccination, but is not vaccinated completely. Missed
opportunities occur in settings that routinely offer
immunization, such as primary care offices or public health
clinics, and settings that do not routinely offer
immunizations including health care settings (e.g.,
emergency departments, inpatient wards) and public
health settings (e.g., WIC program sites).
Reminders and Recall to Providers
• Communications to health care
providers that an individual client's
immunization are due soon or past
due

Settings Where Missed
Opportunities Occur
• Settings that traditionally offer
immunizations (e.g., primary care
offices or public health clinics)
• Settings that do not traditionally offer
immunizations
- Health care settings (e.g., ED)
- Public health settings (e.g., WIC)
Causes of Missed Opportunities
• Lack of simultaneous administration
• Unaware child needs additional
vaccines
• Invalid contraindications
• Avoidance of accelerated schedule
• Inappropriate clinic policies
Strategies For Reducing
Missed Opportunities
• Standing orders
• Provider education with feedback
• Provider reminder and recall
systems
• Reimbursement deficiencies º
Why are there missed opportunities to vaccinate? Many
nurses and physicians avoid simultaneous administration
of four or even three injectable vaccines. Frequently
stated reasons for resistance to simultaneous
administration have included concern about reduced
immune response, adverse events, and parental objection,
none of which are supported by scientific data. Providers
also may be unaware that a child is in need of vaccination
(especially if the immunization record is not available at
the visit), may follow invalid contraindications (see
Chapter 2 for more information), or may avoid use of the
accelerated schedule. The accelerated schedule is
especially important early in the series in order to assure
that the six-month minimum interval between DTP3 and
DTP4 has elapsed in time to allow DTP4 to be given
simultaneously with vaccines required after 12 months of
age (especially MMR).
Some of the reasons for missed opportunities relate to larger
systems — e.g., a clinic that has a policy not to vaccinate at
any visits except well child care, or not to vaccinate
siblings. And some of the reasons relate to very large
systems, like state insurance laws that deny
reimbursement if a vaccine is given during an acute visit.
The degree of difficulty in eliminating the missed
opportunity may vary directly with the size of the system
that has to be changed.
Strategies to rid practices of missed opportunities. Several
studies have shown that eliminating missed opportunities could
increase coverage by up to 20 percent. Strategies designed to
reduce missed opportunities have included several
modalities alone or in combination. Examples include:
• Standing orders — These are interventions in which
non-physician immunization personnel vaccinate
clients by protocol without direct physician
involvement at the time of the immunization. This may
occur in a variety of settings such as clinics, hospitals,
and nursing homes. When used alone or in
combination with other interventions, standing orders
have had positive effects among adults in a range of
settings.
• Provider education — Giving immunization providers
information has been attempted with written materials,
videos, lectures, and computerized software. Providing
only knowledge may have limited impact on provider
behavior, while implementing multi-component
interventions that incorporate both knowledge and
other strategies (e.g., feedback, incentives) show more
convincing evidence of effectiveness.

• Provider reminder/recall systems — These are
discussed above. While provider reminder/recall
systems generally work to increase immunization
levels, they may not be effective in decreasing missed
opportunities if they are implemented in an
inconsistent way or if providers strongly adhere to
invalid contraindications.
Reduction of barriers to immunization within the
practice
Time and space are two of the chief characteristics of the
physical universe. They are also two of the chief barriers
to vaccination. Thus, attempts have been made to
decrease the distance people must travel or the time they
must spend to get vaccinated. Expanding office hours is
one example of this approach. Although data are
insufficient to support such an intervention by itself,
strong evidence exists that reducing barriers is a valuable
component of a multi-component intervention.
Psychological barriers to health care are often more subtle, but
may be just as important. Unpleasant experiences (e.g., being
scolded for previously missed appointments, crossing an
unlit parking lot) may lead clients to procrastinate about
receiving needed vaccination. Health care offices should
provide a supportive and safe atmosphere for clients.
Summary
Immunization delivery systems must be improved for people
in all age groups, and especially for the poor and
minorities. Strong evidence exists that improvement can
be achieved through practice-based assessment of
immunization rates and feedback of those rates to all the
people involved. The use of incentives — even if they are
simple recognition of a good job — are useful for enhancing
motivation. The exchange of information among providers
is useful for maintaining motivation, as well as for aiding
education and coordination. The facilitators of this
exchange should encourage discussion of immunization
levels, but also of the system changes that lead to improved
immunization levels.
We have to get the word out that we have strong evidence
about what system changes are needed. We have to get the
word out that there are benefits beyond increased
immunization rates; these system changes can lead to
improvement in a wide range of clinical prevention
services. And we need to find (or become) the prevention
Champions who will lead the work of improving
immunization records, recommending vaccines, creating

This chapter has benefitted considerably from work being

immunization levels. The Guide, being developed under the
auspices of the U.S. Public Health Service, will summarize
data on the effectiveness and, when possible, the cost-
effectiveness of population-based interventions for
prevention and control. The Guide will provide
recommendations on these interventions and methods for
their delivery. We expect that the chapter on vaccine-
preventable disease will provide information about a
wider range of strategies to improve coverage than are
included here and will provide more of the evidence on
which the conclusions are based. Publication of the
chapter devoted to immunization is anticipated by late
1999. Additional information on the Guide is provided in

Diphtherid
IPHTHERIAIS ANACUTE, TOXIN-MEDIATED DISEASE caused by
Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The name of the
disease is derived from the Greek diphthera,
meaning leather hide. The disease was described in the
5th Century B.C. by Hippocrates, and epidemics were
described in the 6th Century A.D. by Aetius. The
bacterium was first observed in diphtheritic membranes by
Klebs in 1883 and cultivated by Löffler in 1884. Antitoxin
was invented in late 19th century, and toxoid was
developed in the 1920s.
Corynebacterium diphtheriae
C. diphtheriae is an aerobic gram-positive bacillus. Toxin-
production (toxigenicity) occurs only when the bacillus is
itself infected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacterio-
phage) carrying the genetic information for the toxin (tox
gene). Only toxigenic strains can cause severe disease.
Culture of the organism requires selective media contain-
ing tellurite. If isolated, the organism must be distin-
guished in the laboratory from other Corynebacterium
species that normally inhabit the nasopharynx and skin
(e.g., diphtheroids).
There are three biotypes — gravis, intermedius, and mitis.
The most severe disease is associated with the gravis
biotype, but any strain may produce toxin. All isolates of
C. diphtheriae should be tested by the laboratory for
toxigenicity.
Pathogenesis
Susceptible persons may acquire toxigenic diphtheria
bacilli in the nasopharynx. The organism produces a toxin
that inhibits cellular protein synthesis and is responsible
for local tissue destruction and membrane formation. The
toxin produced at the site of the membrane is absorbed
into the bloodstream and then distributed to the tissues of

Clinical Features
• Incubation period 2-6 days (range, 1-10 days)
• May involve any mucous membrane
• Classified based on site of infection:
- Anterior nasal
- Tonsillar and pharyngeal
- Laryngeal
- Cutaneous
- Ocular
- Genital
Pharyngeal and Tonsillar Diphtheria
• Insidious onset of exudative pharyngitis
• Exudate spreads over 2-3 days and may
form adherent membrane
• Membrane adherent to pharynx and may
cause respiratory obstruction
• Fever usually not high but patient
appears toxic
the body. The toxin is responsible for the major complica-
tions of myocarditis and neuritis and can also cause low
platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and protein in the
urine (proteinuria).
Clinical disease associated with non-toxin-producing
strains is generally milder. While rare severe cases have
been reported, these may actually have been caused by
toxigenic strains which were not detected due to inad-
equate culture sampling.
Clinical Features
The incubation period of diphtheria is 2-5 days (range, 1-10
days).
Disease can involve almost any mucous membrane. For
clinical purposes, it is convenient to classify diphtheria
into a number of manifestations, depending on the site of
disease.
Anterior nasal diphtheria
The onset is indistinguishable from that of the common
cold and is usually characterized by a mucopurulent nasal
discharge (containing both mucus and pus) which may
become blood-tinged. A white membrane usually forms on
the nasal septum. The disease is usually fairly mild be-
cause of apparent poor systemic absorption of toxin in this
location, and can be terminated rapidly by antitoxin and
antibiotic therapy.
Pharyngeal and tonsillardiphtheria
The most common sites of infection are the tonsils and the
pharynx. Infection at these sites is usually associated with
substantial systemic absorption of toxin. The onset of
pharyngitis is insidious. Early symptoms include malaise,
sore throat, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Within 2-3
days, a bluish-white membrane forms and extends, varying
in size from covering a small patch on the tonsils to cover-
ing most of the soft palate. Often by the time a physician
is contacted, the membrane is greyish-green in color, or
black if there has been bleeding. There is a minimal
amount of mucosal erythema surrounding the membrane.
The membrane is adherent to the tissue, and forcible
attempts to remove it cause bleeding. Extensive mem-
brane formation may result in respiratory obstruction.





## p. 47 (#59) ##############################################

D/PTHER/A
The patient may recover at this point; or if enough toxin is
absorbed, develop severe prostration, striking pallor, rapid
pulse, stupor, coma, and may even die within 6 to 10 days.
Fever is usually not high, even though the patient may
appear quite toxic. Patients with severe disease may
develop marked edema of the submandibular areas and the
anterior neck along with lymphadenopathy, giving a char-
acteristic “bullneck” appearance.
Laryngeal diphtheria
Laryngeal diphtheria can be either an extension of the
pharyngeal form or the only site involved. Symptoms
include fever, hoarseness, and a barking cough. The mem-
brane can lead to airway obstruction, coma, and death.
Cutaneous (skin) diphtheria
In the United States, cutaneous diphtheria has been most
often associated with homeless persons. Skin infections
are quite common in the tropics and are probably respon-
sible for the high levels of natural immunity found in these
populations. Skin infections may be manifested by a scal-
ing rash or by ulcers with clearly demarcated edges and
membrane, but any chronic skin lesion may harbor C.
diphtheriae, along with other organisms. Generally, the
organisms isolated from recent cases in the United States
were non-toxigenic. In general, the severity of the skin
disease with toxigenic strains appears to be less than in
other forms of infection with toxigenic strains. Skin dis-
eases associated with nontoxigenic strains are no longer
reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance
System in the United States.
Other sites of involvement include the mucous mem-
branes of the conjunctiva and vulvo-vaginal area, as well as
the external auditory canal.

Myocarditis
Abnormal cardiac rhythms can occur early in the course of
the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. If
myocarditis occurs early, it is often fatal.


## p. 48 (#60) ##############################################

48. D/PTHER/A
Neuritis
This complication most often affects motor nerves and
usually clears completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is
most frequent during the third week of illness. Eye
muscles, limbs, and diaphragm paralysis can occur after
the fifth week. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory
failure may result from diaphragmatic paralysis.
Other complications include otitis media and respiratory
insufficiency due to airway obstruction, especially in
infants.
Death
The overall case-fatality rate for diphtheria is 5%-10%,
with higher death rates (up to 20%) in persons <5 and >40
years of age. The case-fatality rate for diphtheria has
changed very little during the last 50 years.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Diagnosis is usually made based on the clinical presenta-
tion since it is imperative to begin presumptive therapy
quickly.
Culture of the lesion is done to confirm the diagnosis. It
is critical to take a swab of the pharyngeal area, especially
any discolored areas, ulcerations, and tonsillar crypts.
Culture medium containing tellurite is preferred because
it provides a selective advantage for the growth of this
organism. A blood agar plate is also inoculated for the
detection of hemolytic streptococcus. If diphtheria bacilli
are isolated, they must be tested for toxin production.
Gram stain and Kenyon stain of material from the
membrane itself can be helpful when trying to confirm the
clinical diagnosis. The Gram stain may show multiple
club-shaped forms which look like Chinese characters.
Other Corynebacterium species (“diphtheroids”) that can
normally inhabit the throat may confuse the interpretation
of direct stain. However, treatment should be started if
clinical diphtheria is suggested, even in the absence of a
diagnostic Gram stain.
In the event that prior antibiotic therapy may have im-
peded a positive culture in a suspect diphtheria case, two
sources of evidence may aid in presumptive diagnosis: (1)
isolation of the C. diphtheriae from culturing of close
contacts, and/or (2) a low non-protective diphtheria anti-
body titer in sera obtained prior to antitoxin administra-
tion (<0.1 I.U.) This is done by commercial laboratories and
requires several days.


## p. 49 (#61) ##############################################

D/PTHER/A 49
To isolate C. diphtheriae from carriers, it is best to inocu-
late a Löffler's or Pai's slant with the throat swab. After an
incubation period of 18-24 hours, growth from the slant is
used to inoculate a medium containing tellurite.
Medical Management
Diphtheria antitoxin
Diphtheria antitoxin, produced in horses, was first used in
the United States in 1891. It is no longer indicated for
prophylaxis of contacts of diphtheria cases, only for the
treatment of diphtheria.
Antitoxin will not neutralize toxin that is already fixed to
tissues, but will neutralize circulating (unbound) toxin and
will prevent progression of disease. The patient must be
tested for sensitivity before antitoxin is given. Consulta-
tion on the use of diphtheria antitoxin is available at all
times through the CDC operator at (404) 639-2889 or 2888.
During office hours, 8:00 am - 4:30 pm EST, contact staff at
the Child Vaccine Preventable Diseases Branch, National
Immunization Program, (404) 639-8255.
Persons with suspected diphtheria should be given antibi-
otics and antitoxin in adequate dosage and placed in isola-
tion after the provisional clinical diagnosis is made and
appropriate cultures are obtained. Respiratory support
and airway maintenance should also be administered as
needed.
Antibiotics
Treatment with erythromycin orally or by injection
(40 mg/kg/day; maximum, 2 gm/day) for 14 days, or
procaine penicillin G daily, intramuscularly (300,000 U/day
for those weighing 10 kg or less and 600,000 U/day for
those weighing more than 10 kg) for 14 days. The disease
is usually not contagious 48 hours after antibiotics are
instituted. Elimination of the organism should be docu-
mented by two consecutive negative cultures after therapy

Preventive measures
For close contacts, especially household contacts, a
diphtheria booster, appropriate for age, should be given.
Contacts should also receive antibiotics—benzathine
penicillin G (600,000 units for persons less than
6 years old and 1,200,000 units for those 6 years old and
older) or a 7- to 10-day course of oral erythromycin,

Contacts of cutaneous diphtheria should be handled as
above; however, if the strain is shown to be nontoxigenic,
investigation of contacts can be discontinued.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Diphtheria occurs worldwide, but clinical cases are more
prevalent in temperate zones. In the United States during
the pretoxoid era, the highest incidence was in the South-
east during the winter. More recently, highest incidence
rates have been in states with significant populations of
Native Americans. No geographic concentration of cases is
currently observed in the United States.
Reservoir
Human carriers are usually asymptomatic. In outbreaks,
high percentages of children are found to be transient
carriers.
Transmission
Transmission is most often person-to-person spread from
the respiratory tract. Rarely, transmission may occur from
skin lesions or articles soiled with discharges from lesions
of infected persons (fomites).
Temporal pattern
In temperate areas, diphtheria most frequently occurs
during winter and spring.
Communicability
Transmission may occur as long as virulent bacilli are
present in discharges and lesions. The time is variable,
but organisms usually persist 2 weeks or less, and seldom
more than 4 weeks, without antibiotics. Chronic carriers
may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Effective
antibiotic therapy promptly terminates shedding.

Secular Trends in the United States
Diphtheria was once a major cause of morbidity and mor-
tality among children. In England and Wales during the
1930s, diphtheria was among the top three causes of death
for children :15 years of age. Diphtheria - United States, 1940-1998
In the 1920s in the United States, 100,000-200,000 cases of
diphtheria (140-150 cases per 100,000 population) and
13,000-15,000 deaths were reported each year. In 1921, a
total of 206,000 cases and 15,520 deaths were reported.
The number of cases gradually fell to about 19,000 cases in
1945 (15 per 100,000 population). A more rapid decrease
began with the widespread use of toxoid in the late 1940s. \
1940. 1950 1960 1970 1980, 1990
From 1970 to 1979, an average of 196 cases per year were
reported. This included a high proportion of cutaneous
cases from an outbreak in Washington state. Beginning in
1980, all cases with non-toxigenic cutaneous isolates were
excluded from reporting. Diphtheria was seen most fre-
quently in Native Americans and persons in lower socio-
economic strata.
From 1980 through 1998, only 43 cases of diphtheria were Diphtheria - United States, 1980-1998
reported in the United States, an average of 3 per year cases
(range, 0-5 cases per year). No cases were reported in 1993
and 1995. All cases reported in 1980-1993 were respiratory
disease.
Of 39 reported cases with known age, in 1982-1997,
twenty-five (64%) cases were in persons >20 years of age;
38% of cases were among persons >40 years of age. Most
cases have occurred in unimmunized or inadequately
immunized persons. The current age distribution of cases
corroborates the finding of inadequate levels of circulating
antitoxin in many adults (up to 60% with less than protec-
tive levels).
Although diphtheria disease is rare in the United States, it
appears that Corynebacterium diphtheriae continues to
circulate in areas of the country with previously endemic
diphtheria. In 1996, 10 isolates of C. diphtheria were
obtained from persons in an American Indian community
in South Dakota. Eight of these isolates were toxigenic.
None of the infected persons had classic diphtheria dis-
ease, although 5 had either pharyngitis or tonsillitis. The
presence of toxigenic C. diphtheria in this community is a
good reminder for providers not to let down their guard
against this organism.

Diphtheria continues to occur in other parts of the world.
A major epidemic of diphtheria in countries of the former
Soviet Union has been in progress since 1990. By 1994, the
epidemic had affected all 15 Newly Independent States
(NIS). In 1995 alone, over 50,000 cases and 1,500 deaths
from diphtheria were reported. In the six years from 1990
through 1995, the NIS accounted for over 90 percent of all
diphtheria cases reported to the World Health Organiza-
tion from the entire world. In some NIS countries, up to
80% of the epidemic diphtheria cases have been among
adults. The outbreak, and the age distribution of cases, is
believed to be due to several factors, including a lack of
routine immunization of adults in these countries.
Diphtheria Toxoid
Characteristics
Beginning in the early 1900s, prophylaxis was attempted
with toxin-antitoxin mixtures. Toxoid was developed
around 1921, but was not widely used until the early 1930s.
It was incorporated with tetanus toxoid and pertussis
vaccine and became routinely used in the 1940s.
Diphtheria toxoid is produced by growing toxigenic C.
diphtheriae in liquid medium. The filtrate is incubated
with formaldehyde to convert toxin to toxoid. It is
adsorbed onto an aluminum salt and preserved with
thimerosal.
Immunogenicity and vaccine eficacy
After a primary series of three properly spaced diphtheria
toxoid doses in adults or four doses in infants, a protective
level of antitoxin (defined as >0.1 international units of
antitoxin/ml) is reached in over 95%. Diphtheria toxoid has
been estimated to have a clinical efficacy of 97%.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
The usual schedule is a primary series of 4 doses at 2,4,6,
and 15-18 months of age. DTaP (diphtheria and tetanus
toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine) is the vaccine of
choice for children 6 weeks through 6 years of age. Whole
cell DTP is an acceptable alternative if DTaP is not readily
available. The first, second, and third doses of DTaP or











## p. 53 (#65) ##############################################

D/PTHER/A
DTP should be separated by a minimum of 4 weeks. The
fourth dose should follow the third dose by no less than 6
months.
If a child has a valid contraindication to pertussis vaccine,
pediatric DT should be used to complete the vaccination
series. If the child is less than 12 months old when the
first dose of DT is administered (as DTP, DTaP, or DT), the
child should receive a total of four primary DT doses. If
the child is 12 months of age or older at the time that the
first dose of DT is administered, a third dose 6-12 months
after the second completes the primary DT series.
If the fourth dose of DT. DTP or DTaP is administered
before the fourth birthday, a booster dose is recommended
at 4-6 years of age. Because of waning antitoxin titers,
most individuals have antitoxin levels below optimal levels
10 years after the last dose. A booster dose (as Tā) should
be administered every 10 years to maintain a protective
antitoxin titer.
Td is the vaccine of choice for children 7 years old and
older, and for adults. A primary series is three doses. The
first two doses should be separated by at least 4 weeks,
and the third dose given 6 months after the second. A
booster dose of Td should be given every 10 years.
Interrupting the recommended schedule or delaying
subsequent doses does not reduce the ultimate immunity.
There is no need to restart a series regardless of the time
elapsed between doses.
Tetanus toxoid should be given with diphtheria toxoid as
Td every 10 years. The first booster dose may be given at
11-12 years of age, if at least 5 years have elapsed since the
last dose of DTP, DTaP, or DT. If a dose is given sooner as
part of wound management, the next booster is not needed
for 10 years thereafter. More frequent boosters are not
indicated and have been reported to result in an increased
incidence and severity of local adverse reactions.
Diptheria disease may not confer immunity. Individuals
recovering from diptheria should begin or complete active
immunization with diphtheria toxoid during
convalescence. This is less of a concern than with tetanus.

uncommon
• Severe systemic reactions rare
Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids
Contraindications and Precautions
• Severe allergic reaction to
vaccine component or following
prior dose
• Moderate or severe acute illness
Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
Local reactions, generally erythema and induration with
or without tenderness, are common after the
administration of vaccines containing diphtheria antigen.
They are usually self-limited and require no therapy. A
nodule may be palpable at the injection site for several
weeks. Abscess at the site of injection has been reported.
Fever and other systemic symptoms are uncommon.
Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions, characterized by
severe local reactions, may occur, particularly in persons
who have had multiple prior boosters. These reactions are
a result of high circulating levels of diphtheria antitoxin.
Arthus reactions do not contraindicate subsequent doses
of diphtheria toxoid, but the recommended spacing be-
tween booster doses should be maintained.
Rarely, severe systemic reactions such as generalized
urticaria, anaphylaxis, or neurologic complications have
been reported by those receiving diphtheria toxoid.
Contraindications and Precautions
to Vaccination
Persons with a history of neurologic or severe allergic
reaction following a previous dose should not receive
additional doses of diphtheria toxoid. Diphtheria toxoid
should be deferred for those individuals who have
moderate to severe acute illness, but persons with mild
illness may be vaccinated. Immunosuppression and
pregnancy are not contraindications to diphtheria toxoid.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
The vaccine may be shipped without refrigeration if deliv-
erable in 4 days. Refrigerant may be used. It should be
refrigerated immediately upon arrival and stored at a
temperature of 2°-8°C (35°-46°F). It should not be frozen
— this reduces potency, and it should not be stored in
direct contact with refrigerant.
Suspect Case Investigation and Control
Immediate action on all highly suspect cases (including
cutaneous) is warranted until shown not to be toxigenic

C. diphtheriae. The following action should also be taken
for any toxigenic C. diphtheriae carriers who are detected.
1. Contact state health department or CDC.
2. Obtain appropriate cultures and preliminary clinical
and epidemiological information (including vaccine
history).
3. Begin early presumptive treatment with antibiotics and
antitoxin. Start antibiotics and antitoxin. Impose strict
isolation until at least two cultures are negative 24 hours
after antibiotics were stopped.
4. Identify close contacts, especially household members
and other persons directly exposed to oral secretions of
the patient. Culture all close contacts, regardless of their
immunization status. Ideally, culture should be from both
throat and nasal swabs. After culture, all contacts should
receive antibiotic prophylaxis. Inadequately immunized
contacts should receive DTP/DTaP/DT/Td boosters. If less
than three doses diphtheria toxoid have been given, or
vaccination history is unknown, an immediate dose of
diphtheria toxoid should be given and the primary series
completed according to the current schedule. If >5
years have elapsed since administration of diphtheria
toxoid-containing vaccine, a booster dose should be
given. If the most recent dose was within 5 years, no
booster is required (see the ACIP's 1991 Diphtheria,
Tetanus, and Pertussis: Recommendations for Vaccine Use
and Other Preventive Measures for schedule for
children -7 years of age.)
- - Diphtheria
Unimmunized contacts should start a course of Summary
DTP/DTaP/DT/Td vaccine and be monitored closely for Toxin mediated
symptoms of diphtheria for 7 days.
• Fewer than 5 reported cases per year
5. Treat any confirmed carrier with adequate course of
antibiotic, and repeat cultures at a minimum of 2 weeks
to assure eradication of the organism. Persons who
continue to harbor the organism after treatment with
either penicillin or erythromycin should receive an
additional 10-day course of erythromycin and should
submit samples for follow-up cultures.

ETANUS IS ANACUTE, OFTEN FATAL, DISEASE CAUSED by an
exotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. It is
characterized by generalized rigidity and convulsive
spasms of skeletal muscles. The muscle stiffness usually
involves the jaw (lockjaw) and neck and then becomes
generalized.
Although records from antiquity (5th century B.C.) contain
clinical descriptions of tetanus, it was Carle and Rattone
who first produced tetanus in animals by injecting them
with pus from a fatal human tetanus case in 1884. During
the same year, Nicolaier produced tetanus in animals by
injecting them with samples of soil. In 1889, Kitasato
isolated the organism from a human victim, showed that it
produced disease when injected into animals, and reported
that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies.
In 1897, Nocard demonstrated the protective effect of
passively transferred antitoxin, and passive immunization
in humans was used during World War I. Tetanus toxoid
was described by Descombey in 1924, and the effectiveness
of active immunization was demonstrated in World War II.
Clostridium tetani
C. tetani is a slender, gram-positive, anaerobic rod that may
develop a terminal spore, giving it a drumstick appearance.
The organism is sensitive to heat and cannot survive in the
presence of oxygen. The spores, in contrast, are very
resistant to heat and the usual antiseptics. They can survive
autoclaving at 121°C for 10-15 minutes. The spores are also
relatively resistant to phenol and other chemical agents.
The bacilli are widely distributed in soil and street dust,
and in the intestines and feces of horses, sheep, cattle,
dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens. Manure-
treated soil may be highly infectious. In agricultural
areas, a significant number of human adults may harbor
the organism. The spores can also be found on skin
surfaces and in contaminated heroin.

Tetanus - Pathogenesis
of spores and production of toxins.
• Toxin binds in central nervous system
• Interferes with neurotransmitter release
to block inhibitor impulses.
• Leads to unopposed muscle contraction
and spasm.
Tetanus - Clinical Features
• Incubation period 8 days (range, 3-21 days)
-Three clinical forms: Local (uncommon),
cephalic (rare), generalized (most common)
• Generalized tetanus: descending symptoms
of trismus (lockjaw), difficulty swallowing,
muscle rigidity, spasms
• Spasms continue for 3-4 weeks; complete
recovery may take months
• Anaerobic conditions allow germination
Pathogenesis
C. tetani usually enters the body through a wound. In the
presence of anaerobic (low oxygen) conditions, the spores
germinate. Toxins, including tetanospasmin, are produced,
and disseminated via blood and lymphatics. Toxins act at
several sites within the central nervous system, including
peripheral motor end plates, spinal cord, brain, and
sympathetic nervous system. The typical clinical
manifestations of tetanus are caused when tetanus toxin
interferes with release of neurotransmitters, blocking
inhibitor impulses. This leads to unopposed muscle
contraction and spasm. Seizures may occur, and the
autonomic nervous system may also be affected.
Clinical Features
The incubation period varies from 3 days to 3 weeks,
usually 8 days. The further the injury site is from the
central nervous system, the longer the incubation period.
The shorter the incubation period, the higher the chance of
death. In neonatal tetanus, symptoms usually appear from
4 to 14 days after birth, averaging about 7 days.
On the basis of clinical findings, three differentforms of tetanus
have been described.
Local tetanus is an uncommon form of the disease, in
which patients have persistent contraction of muscles in
the same anatomic area as the injury preceding the
tetanus. These contractions may persist for many weeks
before gradually subsiding. Local tetanus may precede the
onset of generalized tetanus, but is generally milder. Only
about 1% of cases are fatal.
Cephalic tetanus is a rare form of the disease,
occasionally occurring with otitis media (ear infections) in
which C. tetani is present in the flora of the middle ear, or
following injuries to the head. There is involvement of the
cranial nerves, especially in the facial area.
The most common type (about 80%) of reported tetanus is
generalized tetanus. The disease usually presents with
a descending pattern. The first sign is trismus or lockjaw,
followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing,
and rigidity of abdominal muscles. Other symptoms
include a temperature rise of 2°-4°C above normal,
sweating, elevated blood pressure, and episodic rapid
heart rate. Spasms may occur frequently and last for
several minutes. Spasms continue for 3-4 weeks.
Complete recovery may take months.












## p. 59 (#71) ##############################################

TETANUS 59.
Neonatal tetanus is a form of generalized tetanus that
occurs in newborn infants. Neonatal tetanus occurs in
infants born without protective passive immunity, because
the mother is not immune. It usually occurs through
infection of the unhealed umbilical stump, particularly
when the stump is cut with an unsterile instrument.
Neonatal tetanus is common in some developing countries
(estimated P350,000 deaths worldwide per year), but very
rare in the United States.
Complications
Laryngospasm (spasm of the vocal cords) and/or spasm of
the muscles of respiration leads to interference with
breathing. Fractures of the spine or long bones may
result from sustained contractions and convulsions.
Hyperactivity of the autonomic nervous system may
lead to hypertension and/or an abnormal heart rhythm.
Nosocomial infections are common because of prolonged
hospitalization. Secondary infections, which may include
sepsis from indwelling catheters, hospital-acquired
pneumonias, and decubitus ulcers. Pulmonary embolism
is particularly a problem in drug addicts and elderly
patients. Aspiration pneumonia is a common late
complication of tetanus, found in 50%-70% of autopsied
CaSeS.
Death. Approximately 30% of reported cases are fatal. In
the United States, most deaths occur in persons >50 years
of age. In about 20% of tetanus deaths, no obvious
pathology is identified and death is attributed to the direct
effects of tetanus toxin. The course usually lasts several
weeks, with gradual decline over time.
Due to the extreme potency of the toxin, tetanus disease
does not confer immunity. Patients who survive the
disease should be given a complete series of vaccine.
Laboratory Diagnosis
There are no laboratory findings characteristic of tetanus.
The diagnosis is entirely clinical and does not depend
upon bacteriologic confirmation. C. tetani is recovered
from the wound in only 30% of cases, and not infrequently
it is isolated from patients who do not have tetanus.
Laboratory identification of the organism depends most
importantly on the demonstration of toxin production in
In 106.

Medical Management
All wounds should be cleaned necrotic tissue and foreign
material should be removed. If tetanic spasms are
occurring, supportive therapy, primarily maintanence of an
adequate airway, are critical.
Tetanus immune globulin (TIG) is recommended for
persons with tetanus. TIG can only help remove unbound
tetanus toxin. It cannot effect toxin bound to nerve
endings. A single intramuscular dose of 3000 to 5000 units
is generally recommended for children and adults, with
part of the dose infiltrated around the wound if it can be
identified. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) contains
tetanus antitoxin and may be used if TIG is not available.
Tetanus disease does not result in tetanus immunity.
Active immunization with tetanus toxoid should begin or
continue as soon as the person's condition has stabilized.
Wound Management
Prophylaxis (antibiotics) against tetanus is neither
practical nor useful in managing wounds; proper
immunization plays the more important role. The need for
active immunization, with or without passive
immunization, depends on the condition of the wound and
the patient's immunization history (see table at left).
Rarely have cases of tetanus occurred in persons with a
documented primary series of tetanus toxoid injections.
Note that persons with wounds that are neither clean nor
minor, and who have had 0-2 prior doses or have an
uncertain history of prior doses, need tetanus immune
globulin (TIG) as well as Ta toxoids. This is because early
doses of toxoid do not induce immunity, but simply
sensitize the body. The TIG provides temporary immunity
by directly providing antitoxin. This ensures that
protective levels of antitoxin are achieved even if the
body's immune response has not yet taken effect.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Occurrence is worldwide, but is most frequently
encountered in densely populated regions in hot, damp
climates with soil rich in organic matter.
Reservoir
Organisms are found primarily in the soil and intestinal
tracts of animals and humans.

TETAWUS
Mode of transmission
Transmission is primarily by contaminated wounds
(apparent and inapparent). The wound may be major or
minor. In recent years, however, a higher proportion of
cases had minor wounds, probably because severe wounds
are more likely to be properly managed. Tetanus may
follow elective surgery, burns, deep puncture wounds,
crush wounds, otitis media (ear infections), dental
infection, animal bites, abortion, and pregnancy.
Communicability
Tetanus is not contagious from person to person. It is the
only vaccine-preventable disease that is infectious, but not
contagious.
Secular Trends in the United States
A marked decrease in mortality occurred from the early
1900s to the late 1940s. In the late 1940s, tetanus toxoid
was introduced into routine childhood immunization and
tetanus became nationally notifiable. At that time, there
were 500-600 cases reported per year (approximately
0.4 cases per 100,000 population).
After the 1940s, reported tetanus incidence rates fell
steadily. Since the mid-1970s, 50-100 cases have been
reported annually (~ 0.05 cases per 100,000). The death-to-
case ratio has been relatively constant at approximately
30%. A provisional all-time low of 36 cases (0.02 cases per
100,000) were reported in 1996.
From 1982 through 1997, 64% of reported cases were
among persons 50 years of age or older, and 53% were
among persons 60 and older. The age distribution of
reported cases has shifted to a younger age group in the
last few years. From 1995 to 1997, people 20 to 59
accounted for 60% of all cases, with people 60 and older
accounting for only 35 percent. The reason for this recent
change in age distribution is both an increase in cases in
20 to 59 year olds, and a decrease in cases in older people.
The increase in cases in 20 to 59 year olds is related in
part to an increased number of cases among injection drug
users in California.
Almost all reported cases of tetanus are in persons who
have either never been vaccinated, or who completed a
primary series, but have not had a booster in the
preceding 10 years.

Heroin users, particularly persons who inject themselves
subcutaneously with quinine, appear to be at high risk for
tetanus. Quinine is used to dilute heroin and may actually
be predisposed to growth of C. tetani.
Neonatal tetanus is rare in the United States, with only 2
cases reported since 1989. Neither of the infants' mothers
had ever received tetanus toxoid.
During 1995-1997, acute injuries such as punctures,
lacerations and abrasions accounted for 64% of reported
cases of tetanus. Thirteen of those with acute injuries
reported stepping on a nail. Other acute injuries included
self-performed body piercing and tatooing, animal bites
and splinters. Twenty-two (18%) of cases reported
injection drug use (IDU). About half of the IDU-related
cases reported a wound, such as an abscess at the site of
injection. Three cases were reported after surgical
procedures (hemorrhoid banding, spine implant, knee
surgery). Eight cases had various chronic wounds. Three
had diabetes mellitus without a known injury or wound.
The type of injury or condition was unknown for 8
reported cases.
Tetanus Toxoid
Characteristics
Tetanus toxoid has proved to be safe and useful since
Descombey first reported its production in 1924. Tetanus
toxoid immunizations were used extensively in the armed
services during World War II. Tetanus cases among this
population dropped from 70 in World War I (13.4/100,000
wounds and injuries) to 12 in World War II (0.44/100,000).
Of the 12 cases, half had received no prior toxoid.
Tetanus toxoid consists of a formaldehyde-treated toxin.
The toxoid is standardized for potency in animal tests
according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
regulations. Occasionally, potency is mistakenly equated
with Lf units, which are a measure of the quantity of
toxoid, not its potency in inducing protection.
There are two types of toxoid available — adsorbed
(aluminum salt precipitated) toxoid and fluid toxoid.
Although the rates of seroconversions are about equal, the
adsorbed toxoid is preferred because the antitoxin
response reaches higher titers and is longer lasting than
following the fluid toxoid.
There is virtually no reason to use tetanus toxoid as a
single antigen for protection. Instead, tetanus toxoid
should be given in combination with diphtheria toxoid,
since periodic boosting is needed for both antigens.

Person 7 years of age or older should receive Td (adult
type); children younger than 7 years of age should receive
DTaP, DTP, or DT.
Immunogenicityand vaccine efficacy
After a primary series of three properly spaced doses of
tetanus toxoid in persons 27 years of age and four doses in
children -7 years of age, essentially all recipients achieve
antitoxin levels considerably greater than the minimal
protective level of 0.01 IU/ml.
Efficacy of the toxoid has never been studied in a vaccine
trial. It can be inferred from protective antitoxin levels
that a complete tetanus toxoid series has a clinical efficacy
of virtually 100%; cases of tetanus occurring in fully
immunized persons whose last dose was within the last 10
years are extremely rare.
Following a properly administered primary series,
virtually all persons develop a protective level of
antitoxin. Antitoxin levels fall over time. While some
persons may be protected for life, most persons have
antitoxin levels that approach the minimal protective
level by 10 years after the last dose. As a result, routine
boosters are recommended every 10 years.
In a small percentage of individuals, antitoxin levels fall
below the minimal protective level before 10 years have
elapsed. To ensure adequate protective antitoxin levels in
individuals who sustain a wound that is other than clean
and minor, a booster is recommended for these people if
more than 5 years have elapsed since their last dose. (See
Wound Management for details on persons who
previously received fewer than three doses.)
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Primary tetanus immunization, usually with combined
DTaP or DTP vaccine, is recommended for all persons at
least 6 weeks old, but less than 7 years of age, for whom
the vaccine is not contraindicated. The recommended
routine primary vaccination schedule calls for doses at 2,

If the child is less than 12 months old when the first dose

receive a total of four primary doses. If the child is 12
months of age or older at the time of the first dose, a third
dose 6-12 months after the second completes the primary
series. If the fourth dose of DTaP, DTP, or DT is adminis-
tered before the fourth birthday, a booster dose is recom-
mended at 4-6 years of age.
Td, which contains only one-third as much diphtheria
toxoid as other diphtheria-containing preparations, is the
vaccine of choice for routine vaccination of all persons 7
years old and older, because local adverse events from
higher doses of diphtheria toxoid are more common in
older children and adults. Three doses constitute a pri-
mary series of Td. The first two doses are separated by a
minimum of 4 weeks, with the third dose given 6-12 months
after the second. The first booster dose may be given at 11-
12 years of age.
Because of waning antitoxin titers, most individuals have
antitoxin levels below optimal levels 10 years after the last
dose of DTaP, DTP, DT, or Ta. As a result, additional
booster doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (as Tā) are
required every 10 years to maintain protective antitoxin
titers.

Local adverse events (e.g., erythema, induration, pain at
the injection site) are common, but are usually self-limited
and require no therapy. A nodule may be palpable at the
injection site of adsorbed products for several weeks.
Abscess at the site of injection has been reported. Fever
and other systemic symptoms are uncommon.

Exaggerated local (Arthus-like) reactions are
occasionally reported following receipt of a tetanus-
containing vaccine. These unusual reactions present as
extensive painful swelling, often from shoulder to elbow.
They generally begin from 2 to 8 hours after injections,
and are reported most often in adults, particularly those
who have received frequent doses of tetanus toxoid.
Persons experiencing these severe reactions usually have
very high serum tetanus antitoxin levels; they should not
be given further routine or emergency booster doses of Td
more frequently than every 10 years. Less severe
hypersensitivity local reactions may occur in persons who
have multiple prior boosters.
Severe systemic reactions such as generalized urticaria
(hives), anaphylaxis, or neurologic complications have
been reported after receipt of tetanus toxoid. A few cases
of peripheral neuropathy and Guillain-Barré Syndrome
(GBS) have been reported following tetanus toxoid
administration. Following a recent review, the Institute
of Medicine concluded that the available evidence favors a
causal relationship between tetanus toxoid and both
brachial neuritis and GBS, although these reactions are
very rare.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
A severe allergic reaction (acute respiratory distress or
collapse) following a previous dose of tetanus toxoid is a
contraindication to receipt of tetanus toxoid. If a

Vaccine Storage and Handling
DTP vaccine, DT (pediatric), Tā, DTP/Hib, DTaP, and
tetanus toxoid should be stored continuously at 2°-8°C
(35°-46°F). The vaccine may be out of refrigeration for up
to 4 days, but should be refrigerated immediately when
received. Freezing reduces the potency of the tetanus
component.

PerfuSSIS
ERTUSSIS, OR WHOOPING COUGH, IS ANACUTE INFECTIOUS
disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis.
Outbreaks of pertussis were first described in the
16th century, and the organism was first isolated in 1906.
In the 20th century pertussis has been one of the most
common childhood diseases and a major cause of childhood
mortality in the United States. Prior to the availability of
pertussis vaccine in the 1940s, over 200,000 cases of
pertussis were reported annually. Since widespread use of
the vaccine began, incidence has decreased more than 98%,
to an average of about 3,700 cases per year since 1980.
In unimmunized populations in the world, pertussis
remains a major health problem among children, with an
estimated 300,000 deaths per year due to the disease.
Bordetella pertussis
B. pertussis is a small aerobic gram-negative rod. It is
fastidious, and requires special media for isolation (see
section on Laboratory Diagnosis).
B. pertussis produces multiple antigenic and biologically
active products, including pertussis toxin, filamentous
hemagglutinin, agglutinogens, adenylate cyclase,
pertactin, and tracheal cytotoxin. These products are
responsible for the clinical features of pertussis disease,
and an immune response to one or more produces
immunity to subsequent clinical illness. Recent evidence
suggests that immunity from B. pertussis infection may
not be permanent.

Pertussis
1-2-week-
Week-to-month-
Pathogenesis
Pertussis is primarily a toxin-mediated disease. The
bacteria attach to the respiratory cilia, produce toxins
that paralyze the cilia, and cause inflammation of the
respiratory tract, thus interfering with the clearing of
pulmonary secretions and potentially causing pneumonia.
Pertussis antigens appear to allow the organism to evade
host defenses, in that lymphocytosis is promoted, but
chemotaxis is impaired. Until recently it was thought that
B. pertussis did not invade the tissues. However, recent
work has shown the bacteria in alveolar macrophages.
Clinical Features
The incubation period of pertussis is commonly 5 to 10
days, with an upper limit of 21 days. The clinical course of
the illness is divided into three stages.
The first stage, the catarrhal stage, is characterized by
the insidious onset of coryza (runny nose), sneezing, low-
grade fever, and a mild, occasional cough, similar to the
common cold. The cough gradually becomes more severe,
and after 1-2 weeks, the second, or paroxysmal stage,
begins.
It is during the paroxysmal stage that the diagnosis of
pertussis is usually suspected. Characteristically, the
patient has bursts, or paroxysms of numerous, rapid
coughs, apparently due to difficulty expelling thick mucus
from the tracheobronchial tree. At the end of the
paroxysm, a long inspiratory effort is usually accompanied
by a characteristic high-pitched whoop. During such an
attack, the patient may become cyanotic (turn blue).
Children and young infants, especially, appear very ill and
distressed. Vomiting and exhaustion commonly follow the
episode. The patient usually appears normal between
attacks.
Paroxysmal attacks occur more frequently at night, with
an average of 15 attacks per 24 hours. During the first 1
or 2 weeks of this stage the attacks increase in frequency,
remain at the same level for 2 to 3 weeks, and then
gradually decrease. The paroxysmal stage usually lasts 1
to 6 weeks, but may persist for up to 10 weeks. Infants
under 6 months of age may not have the strength to have a
whoop, but they do have paroxysms of coughing.
In the last stage, the convalescent stage, recovery is
gradual. The cough becomes less paroxysmal and
disappears over 2 to 3 weeks. However, paroxysms often
recur with subsequent respiratory infections for many
months after the onset of pertussis. Fever is generally
minimal throughout the course of pertussis.






## p. 69 (#81) ##############################################

PERTUSS/S 69
Older persons (i.e., adolescents and adults), and those
partially protected by the vaccine may become infected
with B. pertussis, but usually have milder disease.
Pertussis in these persons may present as a persistent (>7
days) cough, and may be indistinguishable from other
upper respiratory infections. Inspiratory whoop is
uncommon. In some studies, B. pertussis has been
isolated from 25% or more of adults with cough illness
lasting >7 days.
Even though the disease may be milder in older persons,
these infected persons may transmit the disease to other
susceptible persons, including unimmunized or
underimmunized infants. Adults are often found to be the
first case in a household with multiple pertussis cases.
Complications
Young infants are at highest risk for acquiring clinical
pertussis, and for pertussis-associated complications. The
most common complication, and the cause of most
pertussis-related deaths, is secondary bacterial
pneumonia. Data from 1990-1996 indicate that pneumonia
occurred among 9.5% of all reported pertussis cases, and
among 17% of infants <6 months of age.
Neurologic complications such as seizures and
encephalopathy (a diffuse disorder of the brain) may occur
as a result of hypoxia (reduction of oxygen supply) from
coughing, or possibly from toxin. Neurologic
complications of pertussis are more common among
infants. In 1990-1996, seizures and encephalopathy were
reported among 1.4% and 0.2%, respectively, of all cases,
and among 2.1% and 0.4%, respectively, of infants <6
months of age.
Other less serious complications of pertussis include otitis
media, anorexia, and dehydration. Complications
resulting from pressure effects of severe paroxysms
include pneumothorax, epistaxis, subdural hematomas,
hernias, and rectal prolapse.
In 1990-1996, 32% of all reported pertussis cases required
hospitalization, including 72% of all infants <6 months of
age. In this 7 year period, 57 deaths were due to pertussis
(case-fatality rate 0.2%). Forty-eight (84%) of these deaths
occurred in children -6 months of age.

Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of pertussis is usually based upon a
characteristic history and physical examination.
However, laboratory tests may be useful in young infants,
atypical cases, and cases modified by vaccine.
Fastidious growth requirements make B. pertussis
difficult to isolate. Isolation of the organism using
direct plating is most successful during the catarrhal
stage. Specimens from the posterior nasopharynx, not the
throat, should be obtained using Dacron" or calcium
alginate (not cotton) swabs and should be plated directly
onto selective media. Regan-Lowe agar or freshly
prepared Bordet-Gengou medium is generally used.
Success in isolating the organism declines with prior
antibiotic therapy effective against pertussis
(erythromycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) or delay
in specimen collection beyond the first 3 weeks of illness.
A second method of B. pertussis identification in
nasopharyngeal specimens is the direct fluorescent
antibody (DFA) technique. Because direct fluorescent
antibody testing of nasopharyngeal secretions has been
shown in some studies to have low sensitivity and variable
specificity, it should not be relied on as a criterion for
laboratory confirmation.
Serological testing has proven useful in clinical studies,
but is not yet standardized. Due to lack of association
between antibody levels and immunity to pertussis,
results of serologic testing are difficult to interpret. For
these reasons, serologic testing is not widely available. In
some areas it is used for clinical diagnosis and reporting,
but in the absence of standardization, serologic test
results should not be relied upon for case confirmation for
the purpose of national reporting. Cases meeting the
clinical case definition that are serologically positive, but
not culture positive or PCR positive, should be reported
as probable cases.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of
nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirates has been found to be a
rapid, sensitive, and specific method for diagnosing
pertussis. Currently, it is only available in certain
laboratories and direct comparison with culture and
serology are necessary before it can be used for laboratory
confirmation of B. pertussis infection. PCR, once
validated, should be used in addition to culture, NOT as a
replacement for culture, because bacterial isolates may be
required for evaluation of antimicrobial resistance, or for
molecular typing.


## p. 71 (#83) ##############################################

PERTUSS/S
An elevated white blood cell count with a lymphocytosis is
usually present in classical disease. The absolute
lymphocyte count often reaches 20,000 or greater.
However, there may be no lymphocytosis in infants and
children or in mild or modified cases of pertussis.
Medical Management
The medical management of pertussis cases is primarily
supportive, although antibiotics are of some value.
Erythromycin is the drug of choice. This therapy
eradicates the organism from secretions, thereby
decreasing communicability and, if initiated early, may
modify the course of the illness.
Erythromycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
prophylaxis should be administered for 14 days to all
household and other close contacts of persons with
pertussis, regardless of age and vaccination status.
Although data from controlled clinical trials are lacking,
prophylaxis of all household members and other close
contacts may prevent or minimize transmission. All close
contacts ~7 years of age who have not completed the four-
dose primary series should complete the series with the
minimal intervals. Close contacts “7 years of age who
have completed a primary series but have not received a
dose of DTP or DTaP within 3 year's of exposure, should
be given a booster dose.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Pertussis occurs worldwide.
Reservoir
Pertussis is a human disease. No animal or insect source
or vector is known to exist. Adolescents and adults are an
important reservior for B. pertussis and are often the
source of infection for infants.
Transmission
Transmission most commonly occurs by the respiratory
route through contact with respiratory droplets, or by
contact with airborne droplets of respiratory secretions.
Transmission occurs less frequently by contact with
freshly contaminated articles of an infected person.
A silent carrier state is thought to exist, but is infrequent,
transient in duration, and probably of little importance in
maintaining pertussis organisms in the community.

Temporal pattern
Pertussis has no distinct seasonal pattern, but may
increase in the summer and fall.
Communicability
Pertussis is highly communicable, as evidenced by
secondary attack rates of 70%-100% among unimmunized
household contacts.
The contagious period is from 7 days following exposure to
3 weeks after onset of paroxysms, with maximum
contagiousness during the catarrhal stage, usually before
the diagnosis of pertussis is suspected.
Secular Trends in the United States
Prior to the availability of vaccine, pertussis was a
common cause of morbidity and mortality among children.
During the six years of 1940-1945, over 1 million cases of
pertussis were reported, an average of 175,000 cases per
year (incidence of approximately 150 cases per 100,000
population).
Following introduction of vaccine in the 1940s, pertussis
incidence gradually fell, reaching 15,000 reported cases in
1960 (~8 per 100,000 population). By 1970, annual
incidence was ~5000 cases per year, and from 1980-1990,
an average of 2,900 cases per year were reported (~1 per
100,000 population).
Pertussis incidence increased in 1992-1993. In 1993, a
total of 6,586 cases and 12 deaths were reported, the
largest number since 1967 (2.4 per 100,000 population).
Large outbreaks were reported in Chicago (166 cases) and
Cincinnati (352 cases). Reported cases also increased
nationally in 1996. The reasons for the increase are not
clear, but may be a reflection of the 3-5 year cyclicity
observed with the disease.
Children are the most frequent age group with reported
pertussis. From 1980 through 1997, 60% of all reported
cases were in children -5 years of age. Forty percent of
reported cases were children “12 months of age. During
this 18 year period, 13% of reported cases were in persons
>20 years of age. However, older persons have accounted
for a larger proportion of cases in recent years. In 1985-
1987, 75% of reported cases were among children -10 years
of age and 25% of cases were among persons ~10 years. In
contrast, in 1995-1997, children -10 accounted for 58% of
reported cases, while persons 10 years of age or older
accounted for almost 42% of reported cases of pertussis.

PERTL/SS/S
Of the 10,650 children 3 months to 4 years of age with
reported pertussis during 1990-1996 and known
vaccination status, 54% were not age-appropriately
vaccinated with DTP.
Case Definition
The current case definition for pertussis was developed
and adopted by the Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists (CSTE) and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). It defines a clinical case of
pertussis as a cough illness lasting at least 2 weeks with
either paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory “whoop,” or
post-tussive vomiting without other apparent cause (as
reported by a health professional).
Case Classification
Probable - Meets the clinical case definition, but is not
laboratory confirmed and is not epidemiologically linked
to a laboratory-confirmed case.
Confirmed - A clinically compatible case that is
laboratory-confirmed or epidemiologically linked to a
laboratory-confirmed case.
The clinical case definition above is appropriate for
endemic or sporadic cases. In outbreak settings, a case
may be defined as a cough illness lasting at least 2 weeks
(as reported by a health professional). Because direct
fluorescent antibody testing of nasopharyngeal secretions
has been shown in some studies to have low sensitivity
and variable specificity, it should not be relied on as a
criterion for laboratory confirmation.
Both probable and confirmed cases should be reported to
the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System
(NNDSS).
Pertussis Vaccines

mid-1940s. The current whole-cell vaccines are available
in combination with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids as
DTP. It is routinely administered as a five-dose series
beginning at 2 months of age.

causes such damage it does so only rarely. Concerns about

Confidence intervals for vaccine efficacy overlap,
suggesting that none of the vaccines is significantly more
effective than the others. When studied, the acellular
pertussis vaccine was significantly more effective than
whole-cell DTP. Mild local and systemic adverse events
and more serious adverse events (such as high fever,
persistent crying, hypotonic hyporesponsive episodes, and
seizures) occurred less frequently among infants
vaccinated with acellular pertussis vaccines than among
those vaccinated with whole-cell DTP.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is recommended for all
doses of the pertussis schedule. Whole-cell vaccine (DTP) is
an acceptable alternative if DTaP is not readily available.
The primary series of diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis
vaccination consists of four doses of vaccine, the first three
doses given at 4-to 8-week intervals (minimum of 4 weeks),
beginning at 6 weeks to 2 months of age. The fourth dose is
given 6-12 months after the third to maintain adequate
immunity for the ensuing preschool years.
The fourth dose of all brands of DTaP are licensed, and
recommended by ACIP, to be administered at 15 to 18
months of age. However, ACIP also recommends that
under certain circumstances the fourth dose be given
earlier than 15 months of age. ACIP recommends that the
fourth dose of DTaP be given if the child is at least 12
months of age, and at least 6 months have elapsed since the
third dose of pertussis vaccine was given, and, in the
opinion of the immunization provider, the child is unlikely
to return for an additional visit at 15 to 18 months of age.
All three of these criteria should be met in order to
administer the fourth dose of DTaP at 12-14 months of age.
Children who received all four primary doses before the
4th birthday should receive a fifth (booster) dose of
DTap before entering school. This booster dose is not
necessary if the fourth dose in the primary series was
given on or after the 4th birthday. The booster dose
increases protective antibody levels and may decrease the
risk of school-age children transmitting the disease to
younger siblings who are not fully vaccinated. Tripedia,
Infantrix, and Certiva are not currently licensed for the
5th dose if all 4 prior doses were DTaP. However, if any of
the first 4 doses were whole cell vaccine, any licensed
DTaP vaccine may be used for the 5th dose.

Interchangeability of Whole Cell
and Acellular Pertussis Vaccines
• DTaP preferred for all doses of the
series
• DTaP may be substituted for any
dose of the pertussis series
• Series begun with whole cell vaccine
may be completed with DTaP
Interchangeability of Different
Brands of DTaPVaccine
• No efficacy or safety data available
for "mix-and-match" DTaP schedules
using different brands of vaccine
• Series should be completed with
same brand of vaccine if possible
• Use different brand of DTaP if
necessary
No pertussis-containing vaccine is currently licensed for
persons 7 years of age or older. This is because vaccine
reactions are thought to be more frequent in older age
groups, and pertussis-associated morbidity and mortality
decrease with increasing age. As a result, vaccination
with whole-cell DTP or DTaP against pertussis is not
recommended after the 7th birthday.
No single antigen pertussis vaccine is available.
Interruption of the recommended schedule or delayed
doses does not lead to a reduction in the level of immunity
reached on completion of the primary series. There is no
need to restart a series regardless of the time that
has elapsed between doses.
Seroconversion rates and rates of side effects with
simultaneous administration of whole cell DTP/DTaP.
oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), and/or measles-mumps-
rubella vaccine (MMR) are similar to those observed when
the vaccines are administered separately. This practice is
recommended when age-appropriate, especially when
there is doubt that the vaccine recipient will return for
further vaccine doses.
DTaP vaccines are as efficacious as whole cell pertussis
vaccines when administered to infants as the primary
series. In addition, local reactions, fever, and other
systemic adverse events occur substantially less often
after DTaP administration than after administration of
whole cell DTP. As a result, DTaP vaccines are
recommended for all five doses of the vaccination
schedule. For children who have started the vaccination
series with whole cell DTP, DTaP may be substituted
for any doses of the pertussis series. A pertussis
vaccination series begun with whole cell DTP may be
completed with DTaP.
There are no data regarding the safety, immunogenicity,
and efficacy of using DTaP vaccines from different
manufacturers for successive doses of the primary or
booster vaccination series (“mix and match"). Whenever
possible, the same brand of DTaP vaccine should be used
for all doses of the vaccination series. However, the type
of vaccine previously administered may not be known, or
the type of vaccine used for earlier doses may not be
available to a vaccine provider. In these circumstances,
any licensed DTaP vaccine may be used to continue or
complete the vaccination series. Vaccination should
NOT be deferred because the type of DTaP used for
earlier doses is not available.

Infants and children with recognized, possible, or
potential underlying neurologic conditions present a
unique problem. They seem to be at increased risk for
manifesting the underlying neurologic disorder within 2-3
days after vaccination. However, more prolonged
manifestations or increased progression of the disorder, or
exacerbation of the disorder have not been recognized.
Under certain circumstances, vaccination with DTaP or
DTP vaccine should be delayed until the child has been
evaluated, treatment initiated, and the condition stabilized.
These conditions include the presence of an evolving
neurologic disorder (e.g., uncontrolled epilepsy, infantile
spasms, and progressive encephalopathy), a history of
seizures which has not been evaluated, or a neurologic
event which occurs between doses of pertussis vaccine.
A family history of seizures or other neurologic diseases,
or stable or resolved neurologic conditions (e.g., controlled
idiopathic epilepsy, cerebral palsy, developmental delay)
are not contraindications to pertussis vaccination.
Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be administered to these
children at the time of DTaP vaccination, and for 24 hours
thereafter, to reduce the possibility of postvaccination
fever.
Reducing the dose of whole-cell DTP or DTaP vaccine,
or giving the full dose in multiple smaller doses may result
in an altered immune response and inadequate protection.
Furthermore, there is no evidence that the frequency of
significant vaccine reactions is likely to be reduced by this
practice. The use of multiple reduced doses that together
equal a full immunizing dose or the use of smaller divided
doses is not endorsed or recommended. Any vaccination
using less than the standard dose or a nonstandard
route or site of administration should not be counted,
and the person should be revaccinated according to
age.
Children who have recovered from satisfactorily
documented pertussis do not need pertussis vaccine.
Satisfactory documentation includes recovery of B.
pertussis on culture or typical symptoms and clinical
course when epidemiologically linked to a culture-proven
case, as may occur during outbreaks. When such
confirmation of diagnosis is lacking, vaccination should be
completed, because presumed pertussis syndrome may
have been caused by other Bordetella species, Chlamydia
trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or certain viruses.

Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
As with all injected vaccines, administration of DTaP may
DTaP Adverse Reactions cause local reactions, such as pain, redness, or swelling.
Mild systemic reactions such as fever, drowsiness,
fretfulness, and low grade fever may occur after either
• Low grade fever whole-cell DTP vaccination and DTaP vaccination.
• More severe adverse reactions However, mild reactions following the first four doses are
uncommon less common among children who receive DTaP. For
• Encephalopathy not reported instance, fever of >101° F is reported in 3%-5% of DTaP
recipients compared with 16% of whole-cell DTP
recipients. These reactions are self-limited and can be
managed with symptomatic treatment with
acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Moderate to severe
systemic events (such as fever >105°F, febrile seizures,
persistent crying lasting >3 hours, and hypotonic
hyporesponsive episodes) have been reported rarely after
administration of DTaP, and occur less frequently among
children administered DTaP than among children
administered whole cell DTP.

The number of children included in the DTaP trials was

acellular pertussis vaccines are used more widely.
Rºdrº--- Swelling - Pain Fever-101

In 1991 and 1993, the Institute of Medicine (IOM)
conducted comprehensive reviews of all available data on
the relationship of encephalopathy and whole cell
pertussis vaccine. The 1991 report concluded that the
available evidence suggests a causal relationship between
the receipt of whole cell pertussis-containing vaccine and
acute encephalopathy, and estimated the excess risk as 0-
10.5 cases per million doses administered. In 1993, the
IOM concluded that the available evidence suggests a
causal relationship between receipt of whole cell pertussis
vaccine and chronic encephalopathy, based largely on data
from the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study
conducted in Great Britain from 1976 to 1979. However,
the IOM concluded that there was no evidence of chronic
encephalopathy except in children who developed acute
encephalopathy.

Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Contraindications to further vaccination with DTP or
DTaP are severe allergic reaction to a prior dose of
vaccine or vaccine component and encephalopathy not
due to another identifiable cause within 7 days of
vaccination.
Moderate or severe acute illness is a precaution to
vaccination. Children with mild illness, such as otitis
media or upper respiratory infection, should be
vaccinated. Children for whom vaccination is deferred
due to moderate or severe acute illness should be
vaccinated when their condition improves.
Certain infrequent adverse events following pertussis
vaccination will generally contraindicate subsequent
doses of pertussis vaccine. These adverse events are:
Temperature of >40.5°C (105°F) within 48 hours not
due to another identifiable cause.
Collapse or shock-like state (hypotonic-hyporesponsive
episode) within 48 hours.
Persistent, inconsolable crying lasting >3 hours,
occurring within 48 hours.
Convulsions with or without fever occurring within 3 days.
There may be circumstances (e.g., during a community-
wide outbreak of pertussis) in which the benefit of
vaccination outweighs the risk, even if one of the four
precautionary adverse events occurred following a
previous dose. Under these circumstances, one or more
additional doses of pertussis vaccine may be considered.
DTaP should be used in these circumstances.
Acellular pertussis vaccine should NOT be substituted in
children who have a valid contraindication to whole cell
pertussis vaccine. If a valid contraindication or
precaution exists, DT should be used for the remaining
doses in the schedule.

## p. 80 (#92) ##############################################

Vaccine Storage and Handling
DTaP and DTP vaccines should be stored continuously at
2°-8°C (35°-46°F). The pertussis antigen is most
susceptible to extremes of temperature, although normal
ambient temperature up to 4 days will not destroy it.
Freezing, on the other hand, substantially reduces the
potency of the pertussis component.
Other Considerations About the Pertussis
Vaccine Controversy
In addition to the adverse events following whole cell DTP
vaccination already discussed, other issues about the
safety, efficacy, and benefit of whole cell pertussis vaccine
have been raised by its opponents. They argue that (1) a
number of other events, including SIDS and infantile
spasms, may be related to DTP vaccination; (2) the decline
in pertussis incidence is due to improvements in living
conditions and not to pertussis vaccine; (3) modern
medical therapy makes pertussis disease a relatively
trivial illness. To summarize, they argue that the risks of
vaccine usage outweigh the benefits. It is important to
examine each of these issues in greater depth. These isues
have not been raised for acellular pertussis vaccines.
There is no distinct syndrome resulting from vaccine
administration, and therefore many temporally associated
adverse events probably represent background illness
rather than illness caused by vaccine. This distinction is
critical, as the first year of life is also the time when many
congenital neurologic disorders first become manifest.
Further, the known febrile and other systemic effects of
DTP vaccination may stimulate or precipitate inevitable
symptoms of underlying central-nervous system disorders,
such as febrile seizures and epilepsy, particularly since
DTP may be the first pyrogenic stimulus an infant
receives.
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has occurred among
infants who had recently received DTP or DT. The largest
SIDS study to date was conducted by the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the
National Institutes of Health (NIH). In the study, SIDS
cases were actually less likely to have recently received
DTP than non-SIDS cases.


## p. 81 (#93) ##############################################

PERTUSS/S
The onset of infantile spasms has occurred among infants
who had recently received DTP or DT. A case-control
study of infantile spasms in England showed that receipt
of DTP or DT was not causally related to infantile spasms,
but that receipt of DTP may trigger onset in children in
whom the disorder is destined to develop. By chance
alone, some cases of SIDS and infantile spasms can be
expected to be temporally related to the recent receipt of
DTP or DT.
Claims that DTP may be responsible for transverse
myelitis, other more subtle neurological disorders (such as
hyperactivity, learning disorders, and infantile autism),
and progressive degenerative central-nervous-system
conditions have no scientific basis.
Besides the evidence of vaccine efficacy of 70%-90% noted
before, other data point to the effectiveness of pertussis
vaccination. Mortimer studied the relative impact of
vaccination versus improved living conditions on pertussis
incidence. He reviewed deaths from pertussis in children
less than 5 years of age from 1900 to 1974, and showed an
acceleration of the decline in pertussis mortality
beginning in 1940 when vaccine was first widely used.
Only 52 deaths from pertussis occurred from 1970 until
1974, when 4,000-8,000 deaths would have been expected
on the basis of the rate of decline before 1940.
Another way of studying the effectiveness of DTP
vaccination is to examine the experience in nations where
pertussis vaccine utilization declined. In Japan, for
example, pertussis vaccination was used nationwide by
1950. By 1974, pertussis incidence had dropped from 100
cases to 1 case per 100,000 population. However, in the
last half of the 1970s, vaccine use in Japan markedly
decreased after two deaths occurred following pertussis
vaccination. A major epidemic of pertussis ensued, with
an increase in incidence rate to 11.5 per 100,000 in 1977.
The annual number of deaths from pertussis increased
from an average of less than 5 for the years 1970-1974 to
an average of 32 during 1977-1979.
In the United Kingdom, an estimated 75% of children
were fully vaccinated between 1958 and 1974. Following
allegations of adverse reactions after pertussis
immunization, the estimated coverage of children fell to
30% by 1978. A major epidemic occurred in 1978-1979,
with an incidence rate as high as 200 per 100,000 for the
period 1977-1979. More than 100,000 cases of pertussis
and 36 deaths caused by pertussis were reported in the

United Kingdom during this epidemic. Studies carried
out in Great Britain during this epidemic showed a
vaccine efficacy of 70%-90%. A risk-benefit analysis has
been performed for the U.S. to compare the outcomes with
or without a vaccination program using a hypothetical
cohort of 1 million children from birth to 6 years of age
who received or did not receive pertussis vaccination.
The ratio of overall costs without a program to those with
a program was 5.7:1. The benefit-cost ratio (reduction in
disease costs divided by program costs) was 11.1:1.
Without a program, the estimated annual number of
residual defects from encephalitis (both vaccine and
disease induced) would decrease from 54 to 29 cases.
However, the estimated annual deaths from pertussis
would increase more than 10-fold, from 44 to 457.
Pertussis - Summary
• 3000-6000 reported cases per year Pertussis Surveillance
* Most cases and complications in
children -5 years Pertussis cases are reported to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention via two systems. First, the states
provide information about cases of pertussis, including
age, gender, county of residence, and date of onset, to the
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) office.
Most states provide this information on a weekly basis,
but for some there is lengthy delay in reporting. The
second system, the Supplementary Pertussis Surveillance
System (SPSS), consists of detailed epidemiologic
information received on about 80% of cases reported to
the MMWR. Although many pertussis cases go
unreported, the surveillance system is useful for
monitoring epidemiologic trends. For instance, the
highest incidence of pertussis occurs in infancy, the age
group at greatest risk for severe illness and complications.
In recent years, the surveillance system has reflected an
increase in the incidence of pertussis in all age groups,
most notably among adolescents and adults.
• Acellular pertussis (DTaP)
recommended for all doses
• DTaP provides equal protection and
fewer adverse reactions

Poliomyelitis
T. WORDS POLIO (GREY) AND MYELON (MARROW, INDICATING THE
spinal cord) are derived from the Greek. It is the
poliomyelitis virus effect on the spinal cord that leads to
the classic manifestation, paralysis.
Although records from antiquity mention crippling dis-
eases compatible with poliomyelitis, it was Michael
Underwood from Britain who, in 1789, first described a
debility of the lower extremities in children that was
recognizable as poliomyelitis. The first outbreaks in
Europe were reported in the early 19th century, and
outbreaks were reported in the United States a few years
later. For the next hundred years, epidemics of polio were
reported from developed countries in the northern hemi-
sphere each summer and fall. These epidemics became
increasingly severe, and the average age of persons af-
fected rose. The increased age of primary infection
increased both the disease severity and number of deaths
from polio. Polio reached a peak in the United States in
1952, with over 21,000 paralytic cases. Polio incidence fell
rapidly following introduction of effective vaccines. The
last case of wild-virus polio acquired in the United States
was in 1979, and global polio eradication may be achieved
within the next decade.
Poliovirus
Poliovirus is a member of the enterovirus subgroup, family
Picornaviridae. Enteroviruses are transient inhabitants
of the gastrointestinal tract, and are stable at acid pH.
Picornaviruses are small, ether-insensitive viruses with
an RNA genome.
There are three poliovirus serotypes (P1, P2, and P3).
There is minimal heterotypic immunity between the three
serotypes.
The poliovirus is rapidly inactivated by heat, formalde-
hyde, chlorine, and ultraviolet light.

Pathogenesis
The virus enters through the mouth and primary multipli-
cation of the virus occurs at the site of implantation in the
pharynx and gastrointestinal tract. The virus is usually
present in the throat and in the stools before the onset of
illness. One week after onset there is little virus in the
throat, but virus continues to be excreted in the stools for
several weeks. The virus invades local lymphoid tissue,
enters the blood stream, and then may infect cells of the
central nervous system. Replication of poliovirus in motor
neurons of the anterior horn and brain stem results in cell
destruction and causes the typical manifestations of polio-
myelitis.
Clinical Features
The incubation period for poliomyelitis is commonly 6 to
20 days with a range from 3 to 35 days.
The response to poliovirus infection is highly variable and
has been categorized based on the severity of clinical
presentation.
Up to 95% of all polio infections are inapparent or sub-
clinical without symptoms. Estimates of the ratio of
inapparent to paralytic illness vary from 50:1 to 1,000:1
(usually 200:1). Infected persons without symptoms shed
virus in the stool, and are able to transmit the virus to
others.
Approximately 4%-8% of polio infections consist of a
minor, nonspecific illness without clinical or laboratory
evidence of central nervous system invasion. This syn-
drome is known as abortive poliomyelitis, and is charac-
terized by complete recovery in less than a week. Three
syndromes observed with this form of poliovirus infection
are upper respiratory tract infection (sore throat and
fever), gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, constipation or, rarely, diarrhea), and
influenza-like illness. These syndromes are indistinguish-
able from other viral illnesses.
Nonparalytic aseptic meningitis (symptoms of stiffness
of the neck, back, and/or legs), usually following several
days after a prodrome similar to that of minor illness,
occurs in 1%-2% of polio infections. Increased or abnormal
sensations can also occur. Typically these symptoms will
last from 2 to 10 days, followed by complete recovery.

Less than 2% of all polio infections result in flaccid pa-
ralysis. Paralytic symptoms generally begin 1 to 10 days
after prodromal symptoms and progress for 2 to 3 days.
Generally, no further paralysis occurs after the tempera-
ture returns to normal. The prodrome may be biphasic,
especially in children, with initial minor symptoms sepa-
rated by a 1- to 7-day period from more major symptoms.
Additional prodromal signs and symptoms can include a
loss of superficial reflexes, initially increased deep tendon
reflexes and severe muscle aches and spasms in the limbs
or back. The illness progresses to flaccid paralysis with
diminished deep tendon reflexes, reaches a plateau with-
out change for days to weeks, and is usually asymmetrical.
Strength then begins to return. Patients do not experi-
ence sensory losses or changes in cognition.
Many persons with paralytic poliomyelitis recover com-
pletely and, in most, muscle function returns to some
degree. Patients with weakness or paralysis 12 months
after onset will usually be left with permanent residua.
Paralytic polio is classified into three types, depending on
the level of involvement. Spinal polio is most common,
and accounted for 79% of paralytic cases from 1969-1979.
It is characterized by asymmetric paralysis that most often
involves the legs. Bulbar polio accounted for 2% of cases
and led to weakness of muscles innervated by cranial
nerves. Bulbospinal polio accounted for 19% of cases and
was a combination of bulbar and spinal paralysis.
The death-to-case ratio for paralytic polio is generally 2%-
5% in children and up to 15%-30% in adults (depending on
age). It increases to 25%-75% with bulbar involvement.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Viral isolation
Poliovirus may be recovered from the stool or pharynx of a
person with presumed poliomyelitis. Isolation of virus
from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is diagnostic, but is
rarely accomplished.
If poliovirus is isolated from a person with acute flaccid
paralysis, it must be tested further, using oligonucleotide
mapping (fingerprinting) or genomic sequencing, to deter-
mine if the virus is “wild-like” or “vaccine-like.”

Neutralizing antibodies appear early and may be at high

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
The CSF in poliovirus infection usually contains an in-
creased number of white blood cells (10 to 200 cells/mm”,
primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein from
40 to 50 mg/100 ml.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
At one time poliovirus infection occurred throughout the
world. Transmission of wild poliovirus ceased in the
United States in 1979, or possibly earlier. A polio eradica-
tion program conducted by the Pan American Health
Organization led to elimination of polio through the West-
ern Hemisphere in 1991. The Global Polio Eradication
Program has dramatically reduced poliovirus transmission
throughout the world. Poliovirus transmission now occurs
primarily in the Indian subcontinent, the Eastern Medi-
terranean, and Africa.
Reservoir
Humans are the only known reservoir of poliovirus, which
is transmitted most frequently by persons with inapparent
infections. There is no asymptomatic carrier state except
in immune deficient persons.
Transmission
Person-to-person spread of poliovirus via the fecal-oral
route is the most important route of transmission, al-
though the oral-oral route may account for some cases.
Temporal pattern
Poliovirus infection typically peaks in the summer months
in temperate climates. There is no seasonal pattern in
tropical climates.
Communicability
Poliovirus is highly infectious, with seroconversion rates
in susceptible household contacts of children nearly 100%
and over 90% in susceptible household contacts of adults.
Cases are most infectious from 7 to 10 days before and
after the onset of symptoms, but poliovirus may be present
in the stool from 3 to 6 weeks.

Secular Trends in the United States
Before the 18th century, polioviruses probably circulated
widely and initial infections to at least one type probably
occurred in early infancy, when transplacentally acquired
maternal antibodies were high. Exposure throughout life
probably provided continual boosting of immunity and
paralytic infections were probably rare. (This view has
been recently challenged based on data of lameness stud-
ies in developing countries.)
In the immediate pre-vaccine era, improved sanitation
allowed less frequent exposure and increased the age of
primary infection. There was infrequent boosting of
immunity from natural exposure, pooling of susceptibles,
and ultimately the occurrence of epidemics, with 13,000 to
20,000 paralytic cases reported annually.
In the early vaccine era, the incidence dramatically de-
creased following IPV introduction in 1955. The decline
continued following OPV introduction in 1961. In 1960, a
total of 2,525 paralytic cases were reported, compared
with 61 in 1965.
The last cases of paralytic poliomyelitis caused by endemic
transmission of wild virus in the United States were in
1979, when an outbreak occurred among the Amish in
several Midwest states. The virus was imported from the
Netherlands.
From 1980 through 1998, a total of 147 confirmed cases of
paralytic poliomyelitis were reported, an average of 8
cases per year. Six cases were acquired outside the
United States and imported. The last imported case
occurred in 1986. Two cases were classified as
indeterminant (no poliovirus isolated from samples ob-
tained from the patients, and these persons had no history
of recent vaccination or direct contact with a vaccine
recipient). The remaining 139 (95%) cases were associated
with administration of oral poliovirus vaccine.
Outbreaks of poliomyelitis in the
United States since 1970
In 1970, on the Texas-Mexico border, 22 cases of polio
occurred, all in children 4 years of age or less. In 1972, in a
Christian Science school in Connecticut, eight cases of
paralytic poliomyelitis and three of non-paralytic occurred
in persons from 7 to 18 years of age. In 1979 ten paralytic
and five non-paralytic cases of poliomyelitis occurred
among the Amish in Pennsylvania, Missouri, Iowa and
Wisconsin. The mean age of these cases was 12 years.

Poliovirus Vaccine
Inactivated (Salk) poliovirus vaccine (IPV) was licensed in
1955 and was used extensively from that time until the
early 1960s. In 1961, type 1 and 2 monovalent oral poliovi-
rus vaccine (MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3
MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent oral poliovirus
vaccine (OPV) was licensed and largely replaced IPV use.
OPV has been the vaccine of choice in the United States
and most other countries of the world since 1963. An
enhanced-potency IPV was licensed in November 1987,
and first became available in 1988.
Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV)
Two enhanced forms of inactivated poliovirus vaccine are
currently licensed in the United States, but only one
vaccine is actually distributed. This vaccine contains all
three types of vaccine-related poliovirus.
IPV is highly effective in producing immunity to polio
virus, and protection from paralytic poliomyelitis. Ninety
percent or more of vaccine recipients develop protective
antibody to all three poliovirus types after 2 doses, and at
least 99% are immune following 3 doses. Protection
against paralytic disease correlates with the presence of
antibody.
The most important advantage of IPV is that it is inacti-
vated, so it cannot replicate, and cannot be shed in the
stool of a vaccinated person. IPV cannot cause vaccine
associated paralysis, and is safe to use in immunodeficient
persons or in household contacts of immunodeficient
persons.
The disadvantages of IPV include that it requires injec-
tion, and there are currently no combination vaccines that
contain IPV licensed in the United States. It is also more
expensive than OPV. The duration of immunity to IPV is
not known with certainty, although it probably provides
protection for many years after a complete series.
IPV appears to produce less local gastrointestinal immu-
nity than does OPV, so persons who receive IPV are more
readily infected with wild polio virus than OPV recipients.
A person who received IPV could become infected with
wild polio virus in an endemic area and could be shedding
wild virus upon return to the United States. The infected
person would be protected from paralytic polio, but the
wild virus being shed in the stool could spread and result
in transmission to a contact.

POLIO/MYEL/TIS
Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV)
Live oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has been the vaccine of
choice for routine vaccination in the United States for the
past 30 years. It remains the vaccine of choice for most
countries in the world. OPV is highly effective in produc-
ing immunity to poliovirus. A single dose of OPV produces
immunity to all three vaccine viruses in about 50% of
recipients. Three doses produces immunity to all 3 polio-
virus types in more than 95% of recipients.
The advantages of live oral poliovirus vaccine are that it is
very easy to administer and is less expensive than IPV.
OPV produces excellent intestinal immunity which helps
prevent infection with wild virus. This characteristic is
important, because it reduces the chance that a vaccinated
person will become infected with wild virus if he or she is
exposed while visiting a polio endemic country. Intestinal
resistance to infection would also help to minimize spread
in the United States if an importation of wild virus were
to occur. As with other live virus vaccines, immunity from
oral poliovirus vaccine is probably lifelong.
Poliovirus vaccine viruses may spread from the recipient
to contacts. Like wild polioviruses, vaccine viruses repli-
cate in the gut and are shed in the stool, and to a lesser
degree from the pharynx. Persons coming in contact with
fecal material of a vaccinated person may be exposed and
infected with vaccine virus.
The spread of oral vaccine-related poliovirus from
vaccinees to contacts has long been thought to contribute
to herd immunity to poliovirus in the United States.
However, new information suggests that contact spread of
vaccine-related poliovirus in the United States may no
longer be as important as was once believed. A study
published in the Journal of the American Medical Associa-
tion in 1996 found that in 1990-1991 only a small increase
in seroprevalence of polio antibody that could be attrib-
uted to secondary spread of vaccine virus. Most polio
immunity attributable to secondary spread of vaccine
virus occurred in children with one or no prior doses of
OPV. Since most areas of the United States have very
high coverage levels with three or more doses of poliovi-
rus vaccine, spread of vaccine virus from vaccinees prob-
ably now contributes relatively little to the level of polio
immunity in the population.
In one way, spread of vaccine poliovirus to contacts is a
disadvantage rather than an advantage. Spread from a
vaccinated person makes it difficult to control unintended
contact with the vaccine virus, and may occasionally result
in vaccine-associated paralytic polio in contacts of
vaccinees.

Unlike injected live virus vaccines (such as MMR),
seroconversion to all three viruses does not occur with a
single dose, and high seroconversion rates to all three
vaccine viruses require more than one dose. This prob-
ably occurs because of intestinal interference between the
three types of vaccine virus, and perhaps because of inter-
ference between vaccine viruses and other enteroviruses.
A second disadvantage of OPV is a small risk of vaccine-
associated paralytic polio in both vaccinees and in con-
tacts of vaccinees.
Vaccine-Associated
Paralytic Poliomyelitis (VAPP)
Vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) is a rare adverse
event following live oral poliovirus vaccine. Inactivated
poliovirus vaccine does not contain live virus, so it cannot
cause VAPP.
The mechanism of VAPP is believed to be a mutation, or
reversion, of the vaccine virus to a more neurotropic form.
These mutated viruses are called revertants. Reversion is
believed to occur in almost all vaccine recipients, but it
only rarely results in paralytic disease. The paralysis that
results is identical to that caused by wild virus, and may
be permanent.
It is likely that the longer the vaccine virus replicates in
the intestine, the more reversion occurs. The longer that
revertants are present, the more likely it is that one will
make its way into the central nervous system and cause
damage.
VAPP is more likely to occur in persons >18 years of age
than in children, and is much more likely to occur in
immunodeficient children than in those who are
immunologically normal. Compared with
immunocompetent children, the risk of VAPP is almost
7000 times higher for persons with certain types of
immunodeficiencies, particularly B lymphocyte disorders
(e.g., agammaglobulinemia and hypogamma-globulinemia)
which reduce the synthesis of immune globulins. There is
no procedure available for identifying persons at risk of
paralytic disease, except excluding older persons and
screening for immunodeficiency.
Vaccine-associated paralytic polio has been monitored by
the CDC since oral poliovirus vaccines began wide use in
1963. While there has been some year-to-year variation,
the number of vaccine-associated cases has remained
relatively stable at 5 to 10 a year since that time. Between
1980 and 1998, 147 paralytic polio cases were reported.
All but 8 of these cases have been caused by vaccine-
related poliovirus.





## p. 93 (#105) #############################################

POL/O/MYEL/TIS
The 125 VAPP cases reported between 1980 and 1994 have
been thoroughly investigated and characterized. During
this 15 year period, 49 (39.2%) cases were reported in
healthy vaccine recipients, an average of 3 cases per year.
The average age of this group was 3 months. Forty cases
(32.0%) occurred in healthy contacts of vaccine recipients,
an average of 3 cases per year. The average age of this
group was 26 years. Six (4.8%) cases were classified as
community acquired. In these cases, vaccine virus was
recovered from the stool, but there was no known contact
with a vaccinated person. The remaining 30 (24.0%) VAPP
cases occurred in immunodeficient persons. Twenty-three
of these persons (76.6% of immunodeficient VAPP cases)
were vaccine recipients, none of whom were known to be
immunodeficient before receiving the vaccine. The re-
maining 7 immunodeficient cases were contacts of vaccine
recipients.
The risk of VAPP is not equal for all OPV doses in the
vaccination series. The risk of VAPP is 7 to 21 times
higher for the first dose than for any other dose in the
OPV series.
From 1980 through 1994, 303 million doses of OPV were
distributed and 125 cases of VAPP were reported, for an
overall risk of VAPP of 1 case per 2.4 million doses. Forty-
nine paralytic cases were reported among immunologi-
cally normal recipients of OPV from 1980 through 1994.
The overall risk to these recipients was one VAPP case
per 6.2 million OPV doses. However, 40 (81.6%) of these
49 cases occurred following receipt of the first dose. The
risk of VAPP was 1 case per 1.4 million first doses. The
risk for all other doses was one per 27.2 million doses.
Forty VAPP cases were reported among contacts of OPV
recipients from 1980 through 1994. The overall risk for
contacts was 1 in 7.6 million. Sixty-five percent of contact
VAPP cases occurred following the first dose in the vac-
cinee, for a first dose risk of 1 case per 2.2 million doses.
The risk for all subsequent doses was 1 case of VAPP per
17.6 million doses.
The reason for this difference by dose is not known with
certainty, but is probably because the vaccine virus is able
to replicate longer in a completely nonimmune infant.
This prolonged replication increases the chance of the
emergence of a revertant virus that may cause paralysis.
The situation is similar for contacts. A nonimmune child
may shed virus longer, increasing the chance of exposure
of a contact.

Reduction of Vaccine-
Associated Paralytic Polio
• Use IPV as the first doses of the
schedule
• Induce antibodies to poliovirus
With IPV
• Reduce or eliminate viremia
following OPV
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Vaccination schedules using IPV alone or OPV alone are
both effective in the prevention of poliomyelitis, and both
are appropriate under certain circumstances (see below).
However, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-
tices recommends the use of a sequential schedule of
IPV followed OPV for the routine vaccination of children
in the United States. The American Academy of Pediatrics
recommends that the first two doses of the polio schedule
be administered as IPV. The third and fourth doses can be
either OPV or IPV. Polio vaccination schedules that
include IPV as at least the first two doses are intended to
further reduce the already small risk of vaccine-associated
paralytic polio (VAPP).
The highest risk of VAPP is with the first dose of OPV.
IPV, when given as the first two doses of the vaccination
series is expected to induce antibodies to poliovirus in
over 90% of recipients. These antibodies would reduce or
eliminate the viremia that results from OPV. Reducing
the viremia from live vaccine poliovirus would in turn
reduce the risk of vaccine-associated paralysis.
The sequential IPV-OPV schedule is expected to produce a
high level of individual protection from two doses of IPV
and should reduce by 95% VAPP that occurs among OPV
recipients. The sequential schedule may also reduce
VAPP among household and community contacts of OPV
recipients because IPV provides some degree of intestinal
and pharyngeal immunity. Inclusion of OPV in the series
induces intestinal immunity among vaccinees, thereby
enhancing community resistance to transmission of wild
virus should it be re-introduced. With a sequential sched-
ule, fewer injections are required in the second year of life
than would be required if only IPV were used, making
compliance with the overall childhood vaccination sched-
ule easier. In the future, licensure of combination prod-
ucts will reduce the number of injections needed to admin-
ister the complete series of recommended childhood
vaccinations

POL/O/MYEL/TIS 95.
For infants, children, and adolescents through secondary
school age (generally up to age 18 years), the primary
sequential series of IPV and OPV consists of 4 doses.
The vaccination series may be started as early as 6 weeks
of age. The primary series is administered at age 2
months (IPV), 4 months (IPV), 12-18 months (OPV), and 4-
6 years (OPV). For persons of any age, the first three
doses should be separated by at least 4 weeks, although an
interval of 6-8 weeks is preferred. It is not necessary to
repeat or add doses if the interval between doses is pro-
longed. Both IPV and OPV can be administered simulta-
neously with DTP or DTaP (diphtheria and tetanus tox-
oids and whole-cell or acellular pertussis vaccine), Hib
(Haemophilus influenzae type b) vaccines, hepatitis B
vaccine, varicella vaccine and measles-mumps-rubella
(MMR) vaccine.
The risk of VAPP is highest following the first dose of
OPV. In order to have the most impact on VAPP, IPV must
be given before any dose of OPV. In addition, a single dose
of IPV does not result in significant protection. At least 2
doses of IPV must be given prior to exposure to OPV for
maximum impact. If 1 or more doses of OPV have already
been given, there is little benefit in switching to IPV.
A schedule using OPV alone is effective for the prevention
of polio. An all-OPV schedule is acceptable if the child
starts the immunization series late (>6 months of age) and
the number of required injections might hinder compliance
with the accelerated schedule. All-OPV is also acceptable
if the child is going to visit or live in a polio endemic area,
because a high level of intestinal resistance to infection
with wild poliovirus would be desirable. A parent may
refuse to allow the child to receive additional injections, in
which case OPV is an acceptable alternative.

If an all-OPV schedule is used, the primary series con-

series is usually integrated with the other vaccines rou-
tinely administered at 2, 4, and 6-18 months of age. For
routine vaccination, the usual interval between doses of
OPV is 6-8 weeks. However, a minimum interval of 4
weeks may be used if an accelerated schedule is required
(e.g., if the child is significantly behind schedule and
requires rapid catch-up). If the third dose of OPV is
administered before the fourth birthday, a fourth dose of
OPV should be provided before school entry (at 4-6 years
of age). The fourth dose is not needed if the third dose is
given on or after the fourth birthday. It is not necessary to
repeat or add doses if the interval between doses is pro-
longed. Because of an increased risk of VAPP, OPV should
not be used for the primary immunization of persons ~18
years of age.
A schedule using IPV alone is effective for the prevention
of polio. An all-IPV schedule is the only acceptable sched-
ule for vaccination of an immunodeficient child or a child
with an immunodeficient household contact. IPV is also
preferred for primary vaccination of an adult over 18 years
of age, such as a traveler to a polio endemic area. To
completely eliminate the risk of VAPP, IPV may be pre-
ferred when parents do not object to additional injections.

If an all-IPV schedule is used, the primary series con-
sists of three doses of vaccine. In infancy, these primary
doses are integrated with the administration of other
routinely administered vaccines. The first two doses are
recommended at 2 and 4 months of age. The third dose
should be given 6-18 months of age. The first and second
doses of IPV are necessary to induce a primary immune
response, and the third dose of IPV ensures “boosting” of
antibody titers to high levels. The preferred interval
between the second and third doses of IPV is 2-8 months.
However, if accelerated protection is needed, the mini-
mum interval between doses of IPV is 4 weeks. Children
who receive three doses of IPV before the fourth birthday
should receive a fourth dose before or at school entry. The
fourth dose is not needed if the third dose is given on or
after the fourth birthday. It is not necessary to repeat or
add doses if the interval between doses is prolonged.
The sequential IPV-OPV schedule is the preferred sched-
ule for routine polio vaccination of children in the United
States. An all-OPV or all-IPV schedule is acceptable or
preferred under certain circumstances. However, four
doses of any combination of IPV or OPV by 4-6 years of
age is considered a complete poliovirus vaccination series.
A minimum interval of 4 weeks should separate all doses
of the series.
The number of injections needed to administer all recom-
mended childhood vaccines to children 2 and 4 months of
age (IPV, DTP or DTaP, Haemophilus influenzae type b
conjugate [Hib), hepatitis B) can be reduced to three if IPV
and Hib-hepatitis B combination vaccines are used. The
number of injections can be further reduced to two if OPV
and Hib-hepatitis B combination vaccines are used. An
additional option to reduce the number of injections re-
quired at the 2 and 4 month visits is to administer hepati-
tis B vaccine on a schedule of birth, 1, and 6 months of age.

Poliovirus Vaccination of Adults
• Routine vaccination of U.S. residents
>18 years of age not necessary
• May consider vaccination of some
adults at greater risk of exposure to
poliovirus:
- travelers to endemic areas
- selected laboratory workers
- selected health-care workers
Poliovirus Vaccination of
Unvaccinated Adults
• IPV preferred
- Use standard IPV schedule if possible
(0, 1-2 months, 6-12 months)
- May separate doses by 4 weeks if
necessary
Polio Vaccination of Adults
Routine vaccination of adults (>18 years of age) who reside
in the United States is not necessary because most adults
are already immune and have a very small risk of expo-
sure to wild poliovirus in the United States.
Some adults are at increased risk of infection with poliovi-
rus. These include travelers to areas where poliomyelitis
is endemic or epidemic, laboratory workers handling
specimens that may contain polioviruses, and health-care
workers in close contact with patients who may be excret-
ing wild polioviruses. In addition, members of specific
population groups with a current disease caused by wild
polioviruses (e.g., during an outbreak), are also at in-
creased risk.
Recommendations for poliovirus vaccination of adults in
the above categories depend upon the previous vaccina-
tion history and the time available before protection is
required.
For unvaccinated adults at increased risk of exposure to
poliomyelitis, primary immunization with IPV is recom-
mended whenever feasible. IPV is preferred because the
risk of vaccine-associated paralysis following OPV is
higher in adults than in children. The recommended
schedule is two doses given at a 1- to 2-month interval,
and a third dose given 6 to 12 months later.
In some circumstances time will not allow completion of
this schedule. If 8 weeks or more are available before
protection is needed, three doses of IPV should be given at
least 4 weeks apart. If 4-8 weeks are available before
protection is needed, two doses of IPV should be given at
least 4 weeks apart. If less than 4 weeks are available
before protection is needed, a single dose of either OPV or
IPV is recommended. In all instances, the remaining doses
of vaccine should be given later, at the recommended
intervals, if the person remains at increased risk.
Adults who have previously completed a primary
course of OPV and who are at increased risk of exposure
to poliomyelitis may be given another dose of OPV. These
adults are not at increased risk of VAPP. The need for
further supplementary doses has not been established.
Those adults who previously completed a primary course
of IPV and are at increased risk may be given a dose of
either IPV or OPV.




## p. 99 (#111) #############################################

POL/O/MYEL/TIS 99.
Adults who have previously received less than a full
primary course of OPV or IPV and who are at increased
risk of exposure to poliomyelitis should be given the re-
maining doses of either vaccine, regardless of the interval
since the last dose and type of vaccine previously received.
It is not necessary to restart the series of either vaccine if
the schedule has been interrupted.
Adults who are household contacts of children receiv-
ing OPV and who have not been adequately immunized
against poliomyelitis with OPV or IPV have a minimal risk
for developing OPV-associated paralytic poliomyelitis.
Since 1980, one or two cases of VAPP have occurred each
year among adult household contacts of children who
received OPV. During that time approximately 19 million
doses of OPV were distributed yearly.
Because of the overriding importance of ensuring prompt
and complete immunization, sequential IPV-OPV vaccina-
tion of children should begin regardless of the poliovirus
vaccine status of adult household contacts. If unvaccinated
or inadequately vaccinated persons are known to reside in
the child's household, IPV alone should be used to com-
plete the child's vaccination, thereby eliminating the
already minimal risk for VAPP among adult household
contacts.
Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
Minor local reactions (pain, redness) may occur following
IPV. No serious adverse reactions to IPV have been docu-
mented. Because IPV contains trace amounts of strepto-
mycin, polymyxin B, and neomycin, allergic reactions
may occur among persons sensitive to these antibiotics.
In rare instances, administration of OPV has been associ-
ated with paralysis in healthy recipients and their con-
tacts. No procedures are currently available for identify-
ing persons, other than those with immunodeficiency, who
are likely to experience such adverse reactions. Although
the risk of vaccine-associated paralysis is minimal,
vaccinees (or their parents) and their susceptible, close,
personal contacts should be informed of this risk (see
section on vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis).
Poliovirus Vaccination of Previously

Contraindications and Precautions
• Serious allergic reaction to component or
following prior dose (OPV/IPV)
• Moderate or severe febrile illness (OPVſlPV)
• Immunodeficiency (OPV)
• Household contact of immunodeficient
person (OPV)
• Pregnancy (OPV)
Contraindications and
Precautions to Vaccination
Serious allergic reaction to a vaccine component, or
following a prior dose of vaccine, is a contraindication
to further doses of that vaccine. Since IPV contains trace
amounts of streptomycin, neomycin, and polymyxin B,
there is a possibility of hypersensitivity reactions in indi-
viduals sensitive to these antibiotics. Persons with ana-
phylactic hypersensitivity, hives, etc., should not receive
IPV. Persons with allergies that are not anaphylactic, such
as skin contact sensitivity, may be vaccinated.
Moderate or severe acute illness is a precaution for
both IPV and OPV. However, mild illness, including mild
diarrhea, is not a contraindication.
Breast feeding does not interfere with successful immuni-
zation against poliomyelitis with IPV or OPV. A dose of
IPV may be administered to a child with diarrhea. A dose
of OPV may be administered to a child with mild diarrhea.
Minor upper respiratory illnesses with or without fever,
mild to moderate local reactions to a previous dose of
vaccine, current antimicrobial therapy, and the convales-
cent phase of an acute illness are not contraindications for
vaccination with IPV or OPV.
OPV should not be given to immunodeficient individuals
or household contacts of individuals who have im-
mune deficiency diseases, immune depression (due to
disease or therapy), or if there is suspected familial im-
mune deficiency. IPV may be substituted for OPV in these
circumstances.
If OPV is inadvertently administered to a household
contact of an immunodeficient patient, the patient and the
recipient of OPV should avoid close contact for approxi-
mately 4-6 weeks after vaccination. If this is not feasible,
rigorous hygiene and hand washing after contact with
feces (e.g., after diaper changing) and avoidance of contact
with saliva (e.g., sharing food or utensils) may be an ac-
ceptable, but probably less effective alternative. Maximum
excretion of vaccine virus occurs within 4 weeks after oral
vaccination.
In general, neither OPV nor IPV should be given to preg-
nant women unless immediate protection is needed (in
which case OPV is the vaccine of choice).








## p. 101 (#113) ############################################

POL/O/MYEL/TIS
Infants may not completely swallow OPV. If, in the judge-
ment of the person administering the vaccine, a substan-
tial amount of vaccine is regurgitated or vomited soon
after administration (i.e., within 5-10 minutes), another
dose can be administered during the same visit. If this
repeat dose is not retained, neither dose should be
counted, and the vaccine should be readministered during
a later visit.
Storage and Handling
OPV
The vaccine should arrive frozen on dry ice. It should be
maintained at a temperature of O°C (32°F) or lower and
may be in either a frozen or liquid state. Unopened vac-
cine may be thawed and refrozen for a maximum of 10
freeze-thaw cycles, if the total cumulative duration of thaw
does not exceed 24 hours and provided the temperature
does not exceed 8°C (46°F) during the periods of the thaw.
Unopened vaccine may be used for up to 30 days if stored
between 2°-8°C (35°-46°F). Opened multiple-dose vials of
vaccine can be used for up to 7 days if stored at 2°-8°C. The
vaccine should be pink or red.
IPV
The vaccine may be shipped without refrigeration pro-
vided it is delivered within 4 days. It should be main-
tained at 2°-8°C (35°-46°F). The vaccine should be per-
fectly clear and colorless. Any vaccine showing particulate
matter, turbidity, or change in color, should be discarded.
Outbreak Investigation and Control
Collect preliminary clinical and epidemiological information
(including vaccine history and contact with OPV vaccines) on
any suspected case of paralytic polio. Notify the National
Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention ([404] 639-8255) after all appropriate local and
state health authorities have been notified. Intensify field
investigation to verify information and collect appropriate
specimens for viral isolates and serology.
Even one case of paralytic poliomyelitis demands immedi-
ate attention. If the evidence indicates vaccine-associated
disease, then no outbreak control program is needed. If,
however, evidence indicates wild virus (for example, two
cases in a community), then all unvaccinated individuals in
the epidemic area who are over 6 weeks of age and whose
vaccine histories are uncertain should be vaccinated.

Polio Eradication
Following the widespread use of poliovirus vaccine in the
mid-1950s, the incidence of poliomyelitis declined rapidly
in many industrialized countries. In the United States,
the number of cases of paralytic poliomyelitis reported
annually declined from >20,000 cases in 1952 to <100 cases
in the mid-1960s. The last indigenous transmission of
wild poliovirus in the United States was in 1979.
In 1985, the member countries of the Pan American Health
Organization adopted the goal of eliminating poliomyelitis
from the Western Hemisphere by 1990. The strategy to
achieve this goal included increasing vaccination coverage;
enhancing surveillance for suspected cases (i.e., surveil-
lance for acute flaccid paralysis); and using supplemental
immunization strategies such as national immunization
days (NIDs), house-to-house vaccination, and containment
activities. Since 1991, when the last wild-virus-associated
indigenous case was reported from Peru, no additional
cases of poliomyelitis have been confirmed despite inten-
sive surveillance. In September 1994, an international
commission certified the Western hemisphere to be free of
indigenous wild poliovirus. The commission based its
judgment on detailed reports from national certification
commissions that had been convened in every country in
the region.
In 1988, the World Health Assembly (the governing body of
the World Health Organization) adopted the goal of global
eradication of poliomyelitis by the year 2000. Substantial
progress toward meeting this objective has already been
achieved in many WHO regions, including East Asia, the
Middle East, Southern and Eastern Africa, and Europe. By
the end of 1998, almost all polio-endemic countries had
conducted NIDs. The number of reported cases of para-
lytic polio, as well as the number of countries reporting
cases, has decreased significantly since the global eradica-
tion program began. In 1997, over half of all polio was
reported from the Indian subcontinent (the S.E. Asian
region of WHO). Polio is still endemic in parts of the
Eastern Mediterranean and Africa.
The polio eradication initiative is supported by a coalition
of international organizations that includes WHO, the
United Nations children's Fund (UNICEF), and other
bilateral and multilateral organizations. Rotary Interna-
tional has contributed more than $240 million to support
the eradication initiative.

Post-Polio Syndrome
After an interval of 30-40 years, 25%-40% of people who
contracted paralytic poliomyelitis in childhood experience
new muscle pain and exacerbation of existing weakness, or
develop new weakness or paralysis. This disease entity is
referred to as post-polio syndrome. Factors that enhance
the risk of post-polio syndrome include increasing length
of time since acute poliovirus infection, presence of perma-
nent residual impairment after recovery from the acute
illness, and female gender. The pathogenesis of post-polio
syndrome is thought to involve the failure of oversized
motor units created during the recovery process of para-
lytic poliomyelitis. Post-polio syndrome is not an infec-
tious process, and persons experiencing the syndrome do
not shed poliovirus.
Several support groups have been established to assist and
provide information to persons with post-polio syndrome,
and their families.

ROfCVirus
iarrheal disease has been recognized in humans
since antiquity. Until the early 1970s, a bacterial,
viral, or parasitic etiology of diarrheal disease in
children could be detected in fewer than 30% of cases. In
1973, Bishop and colleagues observed a virus particle in the
intestinal tissue of children with diarrhea using electron
micrography. This virus was subsequently called rotavirus,
because of it's similarity in appearance to a wheel (rota is
Latin for wheel). By 1980, rotavirus was recognized as the
most common cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and
young children in the United States. It is now known that
infection with rotavirus is nearly universal with 95% of
children infected by 5 years of age. Rotavirus is responsible
for up to 40 deaths per year in the United States, and up to
800,000 deaths from diarrhea world wide. A vaccine to
prevent rotavirus gastroenteritis was first licensed in
August 1998, just 25 years after the virus was discovered.
Rotavirus
Rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus of the family
Reoviridae. The virus is composed of three concentric
shells that enclose 11 gene segments. The outermost shell
contains two important proteins - VP7, or G-protein, and
VP4, or P-protein. VP7 and VP4 induce neutralizing
antibody that is probably involved in immune protection.
These proteins are also the basis of a rotavirus
classification system. For instance, strain “G1P1A"
indicates a virus with VP7 (G) type 1 and VP4 (P) type 1A.
An alternative, and simpler, classification of rotaviruses is
to simply refer to the strain by the type of VP7 present on
the virus. In this system, strain G1P1A is referred to as
strain G1.
Rotavirus
• Highly contagious acute viral illness
• First identified as cause of diarrhea in
1973
• Most common cause of severe
diarrhea in children
• Responsible for >800,000 diarrheal
deaths each year worldwide
Rotavirus
• Reovirus
• VP7 and VP4 antigens responsible
for producing immunity and virus

• 4 predominant strains (G1-G4)

ROTAVIRUS
Rotavirus Pathogenesis
• Entry through mouth
• Replication in epithelium of small
intestine
• Replication outside intestine and
virennia are uncommon
• Infection leads to isotonic diarrhea
Rotavirus Immunity
• Antibody against VP7 and VP4
probably important for protection
• First infection usually does not lead
to permanent immunity
• Subsequent infections generally
less severe
| • Reinfection may occur at any age
Rotavirus Clinical Features
• Incubation period 1-3 days
• Variable clinical presentation-
asymptomatic to severe diarrhea
• First infection after age 3 months
generally most severe
• Illness not specific for rotavirus
At least 10 serotypes of VP7 and 8 serotypes of VP4 are
known to infect humans, so at least 80 different
combinations (strains) of VP7 and VP4 could theoretically
exist. However, only 4 strains predominate throughout the
world: G1P1A, G2P1B, G3P1A, and G4P1A. These 4 strains
are also identified by their VP7 serotype as G1, G2, G3, and
G4. Strain G1 is believed to be responsible for over 50% of
human infections. Strains G2, G3, and G4 account for 11%-
14% each, and all other strains account for about 7%.
Rotavirus is very stable and may remain viable in the
environment for weeks or months if not disinfected.
Rotaviruses cause infection in many species of mammals,
including cows and monkeys. These animal strains are
antigenically distinct from those causing human infection,
and rarely cause infection in humans.
Pathogenesis
The virus enters the body through the mouth. Viral
replication occurs in the villous epithelium of the small
intestine. Replication outside the small intestine and
systemic spread of the virus (viremia) are believed to be
uncommon in immunocompetent persons. Infection may
result in decreased intestinal absorption of sodium, glucose,
and water, and decreased levels of intestinal lactase, alkaline
phosphatase, and sucrase activity, and lead to isotonic
diarrhea.
The immune correlates of protection from rotavirus are
poorly understood. Serum and mucosal antibodies against
VP7 and VP4 are probably important in protection from
disease. Cell-mediated immunity probably plays a role in
recovery from infection and in protection.
Recovery from rotavirus infection usually does not lead to
permanent immunity. After a single natural infection, 40%
of children are protected against any subsequent rotavirus
infection, 75% are protected against rotavirus diarrhea, and
88% are protected against severe diarrhea. Subsequent
infections confer progressively greater protection, and are
generally less severe than the first. Recurrent rotavirus
infections effect people of all ages. Recurrent infections
are usually asymptomatic or result in mild diarrhea that
may be preceded or accompanied by vomiting and low-
grade fever.
Clinical Features
The incubation period for rotavirus diarrhea is 1 to 3 days.
The clinical manifestations of infection vary, and depend
on whether it is the first infection or reinfection. The first
infection after 3 months of age is generally the most
severe. Infection may be asymptomatic, may cause self-

ROTAVIRUS
limited watery diarrhea, or may result in severe
dehydrating diarrhea with fever and vomiting.
The clinical features and stool characteristics of rotavirus
diarrhea are nonspecific, and similar illness may be caused
by other pathogens. As a result, confirmation of a diarrheal
illness as rotavirus requires laboratory testing.
Complications
Rotavirus infection in infants and young children can lead to
severe diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and
metabolic acidosis. Severe illnesses may include neurologic
symptoms.
In the United States, 15%-20% of illnesses are severe enough
to require a visit to a physician's office or emergency
department. Approximately 1.5%-2% of rotavirus infections
lead to hospitalization, and approximately one in 100,000-
200,000 infections is fatal. Because of the large number of
infections, these complication rates equate to more than
500,000 physician visits, more than 50,000 hospitalizations,
and 20-40 deaths per year. About 90% of these
hospitalizations occur by age 3 years.
Risk factors for severe illness are not known with certainty.
Available data suggest that premature infants are at higher
risk of death from diarrhea. Immunodeficient children may
have more severe or persistent disease, and may have
evidence of abnormalities in multiple organ systems,
particularly the kidney and liver.
Laboratory Diagnosis
The most widely available method for confirmation of
rotavirus infection is detection of antigen rotavirus in stool
by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Several commercial test kits
are available which detect an antigen common to human
rotaviruses. These kits are simple to use, inexpensive, and
very sensitive. Other laboratory procedures (such as
polymerase chain reaction, nucleic acid hybridization, and
virus culture) are available for detecting rotavirus in stool,
but are generally limited to research settings. Serologic
tests for IgG and IgA antibody may be used to confirm
recent infection.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Rotavirus occurs throughout the world. The prevalence of
rotavirus strains varies by geographic area, and strains not
included in the vaccine are present in some parts of the
world.
Rotavirus Complications
• Dehydration
• Electrolyte imbalance
• Metabolic acidosis
• Office visits for diarrhea
• Hospitalization for dehydration
• Death

• Disease not specific for rotavirus

• 95% of children infected by age 5 years
• Responsible for:
- 5%-15% of all diarrheal episodes in
children
- 30%-50% of all hospitalizations for
diarrhea in children
Reservoir
The reservoir of rotavirus is the gastrointestinal tract and
stool of infected humans. Although rotavirus infection occurs
in many nonhuman mammals, transmission of animal
rotaviruses to humans is believed to be rare and probably
does not lead to clinical illness. Although immunodeficient
persons may shed rotavirus for a prolonged period, a true
carrier state has not been described.
Transmission
Rotaviruses are shed in high concentration in the stool of
infected children. Transmission is by fecal-oral spread, both
through close person-to-person contact, and by fomites (such
as toys and other environmental surfaces contaminated by
stool). Some experts have suggested that rotaviruses may
also be spread by respiratory droplets.
Temporal pattern
In temperate climates, disease is more prevalent during cooler
months. In North America, the annual epidemic peak usually
progresses from Mexico and U.S. Southwest in the fall to
maritime Canada and the U.S. Northeast by spring. The
reason for this seasonal pattern is unknown. In tropical
climates, the disease is less seasonal than in temperate areas.
Communicability
Rotavirus is highly communicable, as evidenced by the
nearly universal infection of children by age 5 years.
Infected persons shed large quantities of virus in their
stool beginning 2 days before the onset of diarrhea and for
up to 10 days afterward. Rotavirus may be detected in the
stool of immunodeficient persons for more than 30 days
after infection. Spread within families, institutions, |
hospitals, and child care settings is common. |
Secular Trends and Disease Burden in the
United States
Rotavirus infection is not nationally notifiable in the United
States. Estimates of incidence and disease burden are based on
special surveys, cohort studies, and hospital discharge data.
Rotavirus infection is nearly universal. An estimated 2.7
million cases occur each year in the United States alone, |
and 95% of children experience at least one rotavirus |
infection by age 5 years. The incidence of rotavirus is |
similar in developed and developing countries, suggesting
that improved sanitation alone is not sufficient to prevent -
the infection.





## p. 109 (#121) ############################################

ROTAVIRUS 109.
Infants younger than 3 months of age have relatively low
rates of rotavirus infection, probably because of passive
maternal antibody, and possibly breastfeeding. The
incidence of clinical illness is highest among children 3 to 35
months of age. Rotavirus infection of adults is usually
asymptomatic, but may cause diarrheal illness.
Groups at increased risk of rotavirus infection are those with
with increased exposure to virus. This includes children who
attend day-care centers, children in hospital wards
(nosocomial rotavirus), caretakers and parents of children in
day-care or hospitals, and children and adults with
immunodeficiency-related diseases (e.g. SCIDS, HIV, bone
marrow transplant).
Rotavirus appears to be responsible for 5%-15% of all
diarrheal episodes among children under 5 years of age in
the United States. The virus is responsible for 30% to 50% of
all hospitalizations for diarrheal illness in children in this
age group, and for more than 50% of hospitalizations for
diarrheal illness during seasonal peaks.
Rotavirus diarrhea results in an estimated $264 million in
direct medical costs each year in the United States, largely
due to the cost of hospitalization of children with diarrhea.
It results in more than $1 billion in total costs to society,
primarily due to the cost of time lost from work to care for an
ill child.
Rotavirus Vaccine
Characteristics
The first rotavirus vaccines were derived from either bovine
(cow) or rhesus (monkey) origin. Studies demonstrated that
these live oral vaccines could prevent rotavirus diarrhea in
young children, but efficacy varied widely. Because
immunity to G (VP7) and P (VP4) proteins were associated
with disease protection and recovery, new live virus vaccines
were developed that incorporated G proteins or both G and P
proteins for each of the predominant serotypes.
The process by which these vaccine viruses were created is
called genetic reassortment. Tissue culture cells were
infected with two different rotavirus strains- a nonhuman
“parent” strain and a human strain that contained the VP7
gene of a predominant serotype. The “parent” strain was a
rhesus monkey rotavirus that is antigenically identical to
the human G3 serotype. When the viruses replicate, the
offspring viruses have various combinations of gene
segments from the two strains. Offspring were selected
which contained the gene segment coding for a human VP7
serotype. The remainder of the gene is identical to the
parent rhesus monkey virus. By this process, viruses -

protein expressed on their surface).
RRV-TV (RotaShield", produced by Wyeth-Lederle) is the only
rotavirus vaccine licensed by the Food and Drug
Administration. The vaccine is administered orally with 2.5
ml of a citrate-bicarbonate buffer to protect the vaccine virus
from stomach acid. The vaccine is supplied as a lyophilized
pink solid. After reconstitution, the vaccine is yellow-orange to
purple in color and may contain a fine precipitate.
Each dose of vaccine contains 1x10° plaque forming units of
each of the four vaccine viruses. The vaccine contains trace
amounts of fetal bovine serum, neomycin sulfate,
amphotericin B, monosodium glutamate, potassium
monophosphate, and potassium diphosphate. Neither the
vaccine nor the buffer contains a preservative.
Immunogenicityand vaccine efficacy
Studies to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of RRV-
TV have involved almost 18,000 infants in the United
States, Venezuela, and Finland.
As noted above, the immune correlates of protection from
rotavirus are poorly understood, so it is difficult to interpret
seroconversion data. Immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccines
is usually measured by serum IgA seroconversion or by
detection of serum neutralizing antibody to vaccine strains.
The majority of children who received RRV-TV in U.S. trials
developed neutralizing antibody to rhesus rotavirus or had a
significant increase in IgA antibody titers.
Four large placebo-controlled efficacy trials have been
completed in the United States and Finland. The results
from all four of these trials are very similar. The vaccine was
49%-68% effective against any rotavirus diarrhea and 69%-
91% effective in preventing severe rotavirus diarrhea. The
duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter in vaccinated
children who developed rotavirus diarrhea compared with
unvaccinated controls. The vaccine was 50%-100% effective
in preventing doctor visits for the evaluation and treatment
of rotavirus diarrhea. In the Finnish trial (the only trial
large enough to examine this outcome) the vaccine was

ROTAVIRUS
100% effective in preventing hospitalization for rotavirus
diarrhea.
Duration of immunity
The duration of immunity from rotavirus vaccine is not
known. At least one clinical trial has demonstrated that
protection lasts through at least 2 rotavirus seasons.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the
American Academy of Pediatrics recommend routine
immunization with rotavirus vaccine for all infants
without contraindications. The vaccine should be
administered as a series of 3 oral doses at 2, 4, and 6
months of age. The vaccination series may be started at
any time between age 6 weeks and 6 months (that is, up to
the infant's 7 month birthday). The minimum age of the
first dose is 6 weeks.
Infants older than 6 months of age (that is, on or after their
7 month birthday) may have an increased risk of fever
following vaccination. As a result, initiation of
vaccination after age 6 months (that is, on or after the
7 month birthday) is not recommended.
All three doses of rotavirus should routinely be separated by
2 months. However, the minimum interval between doses
may be a short as 3 weeks if an accelerated schedule is
required. Special effort should be made to immunize infants
prior to the winter rotavirus season, and the use of an
accelerated schedule may facilitate this effort.
All doses of rotavirus vaccine should be administered in the
first year of life (that is, before the child's first birthday)
because data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in older
children are not available. The maximum age for any dose
of rotavirus vaccine is 12 months. Rotavirus vaccine should
not be administered on or after the child's first birthday, even
if fewer than three doses have been administered.
Rotavirus vaccine may be administered simultaneously
with all other vaccines that are routinely given at the same
aes (hepatitis B, DTaP, IPV, OPV, Hib). Rotavirus and oral
polio vaccines do not appear to interfere with each other,
as live injected vaccines do. If rotavirus vaccine and OPV
are not administered at the same visit it is not necessary
to wait a specified period before administering the second
vaccine. It may be given as soon as desired.

RRV-TV Rotavirus Vaccine
Recommendations for Use
• Do not repeat dose if infant spits out
or regurgitates vaccine - administer
remaining doses on schedule
• Do not delay vaccination due to
recent receipt of antibody-
containing blood product
Transmission of Rotavirus
Vaccine Virus
e Vaccine virus shed in stool
• No evidence of transmission in U.S.
studies in day care settings
e Transmission documented in Venezuela
study using sensitive assay
• Transmission not associated with illness
Breastfeeding does not appear to diminish immune
response to 3 doses of vaccine. Children who are being
breastfed should be vaccinated on schedule.
All vaccines, including rotavirus vaccine, should be
administered to children with minor illnesses, including
upper respiratory infections, with or without low grade fever.
Vaccination should be deferred for children with moderate or
severe acute illness, and persistent vomiting (see
Contraindication and Precautions section).
Infants who have recovered from documented rotavirus
infections may not be immune to all 4 serotypes present in
the United States. As a result, these infants should complete
the three dose vaccination series by their first birthday.
Data on the safety of administering a dose higher than the
recommended dose, and on the efficacy of a partial dose are
very limited. As a result, a second dose of RRV-TV should
not be administered to an infant who regurgitates, spits
out some or all of the dose, or vomits during or after
administration of vaccine. The infant should receive the
remaining recommended doses, if needed, on the usual
schedule.
No data are available on the effect of receipt of antibody-
containing blood products on the efficacy of RRV-TV.
However, studies have shown that simultaneous
administration of antibody-containing products with OPV
with does not reduce immunogenicity of the vaccine. No
interference is expected to occur between RRV-TV and
parenterally-administered antibody products. As a result,
ACIP recommends that vaccination with RRV-TV not be
deferred because of recent administration of antibody-
containing blood product.
RRV-TV is shed in the stool of vaccinated infants. However, in
studies performed in day care centers in the United States, no
evidence of transmission of vaccine virus to unvaccinated
infants has been documented. However, studies have detected
vaccine virus in the stool of unvaccinated contacts of vaccine
recipients using a very sensitive assay (PCR). Horizontal
spread of vaccine virus has not been associated with disease in
unvaccinated children. Hands should always be washed after
contact with stool or after diapering. Other than this and
other common sense hygiene measures (such as prompt
disposal of soiled diapers and cleaning environmental
surfaces contaminated with stool), no specific precautions
(such as isolation or visitation restrictions) need to be taken
in caring for a vaccinated child, even if there is an
immunosuppressed person in the household. Children may
attend child care facilities after administration of RRV-TV. If

ROTAVIRUS
a child is hospitalized after administration of RRV-TV,
contact isolation is not necessary unless the child has
diarrhea or vomiting.
Adverse Reactions following Vaccination
Safety data are available for almost 7,000 infants who
received RRV-TV in four clinical trials. The most common
adverse reaction reported has been a low grade fever
G-38°C) which can be attributed to the vaccine in about
15% of vaccinated children. Moderate fever (>39°C)
attributable to the vaccine occurs in about 1% of vaccine
recipients, usually 3 to 5 days following vaccination with
the first or second dose. Fever generally lasts less than 24
hours. Decreased appetite, irritability, and decreased
activity were reported following the first dose in some
trials. Vomiting attributable to the vaccine has not been
reported. An increase in diarrhea (about 1.4%) has been
reported from only one study.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Contraindications and precautions for RRV-TV are similar to
those for other live viral vaccines. Contraindication
conditions greatly increase the chance that the vaccinee will
experience a serious vaccine adverse reaction. Infants with
conditions that are considered contraindications to
vaccination should not receive RRV-TV unless the condition
improves or resolves.
RRV-TV is contraindicated for infants who are known to have
had a severe allergic (anaphylactic) reaction to a prior
dose of vaccine or to a component of the vaccine, such as
aminoglycoside antibiotics or amphotericin B.
RRV-TV is contraindicated for infants with known or
suspected immunodeficiency diseases and conditions that
could result in immunosuppression, such as combined
immunodeficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia,
agammaglobulinemia, thymic abnormalities, HIV infection,
or treatment with corticosteroids, alkylating drugs or other
immunosuppressive therapies. The vaccine is not approved
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in
children with solid organ or hematopoietic malignancies
(such as leukemia), children receiving immunosuppressive
therapy or radiation, and in children who have received stem
cell or solid organ transplants. RRV-TV should not be
administered to infants born to women known to be
HIV-infected until tests for HIV infection in the infant
are negative at 2 months or older by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) or viral culture.

ROTAVIRUS
Infants living in households with persons known or
suspected to be immunodeficient, including persons with
HIV infection, should be immunized according to the
normal infant schedule, unless the HIV-infected person is
the infant's biologic mother, as noted above.
Precaution conditions may increase the chance of a vaccine
adverse reaction or reduce the efficacy of the vaccine. In
general, infants with precautions to vaccination should not
receive the vaccine until the condition improves or resolves
unless the benefit of vaccination outweighs the risk of an
adverse reaction.
Moderate or severe acute illness, an evolving
neurologic condition, and persistent vomiting are
precautions to vaccination with RRV-TV. Delaying
vaccination when one or more of these conditions is
present avoids superimposing a possible adverse reaction
from the vaccine (such as fever) on the underlying illness,
or mistakenly attributing a manifestation of the
underlying illness to the vaccine. Infants with these
conditions should be vaccinated as soon as their condition
improves (but only if the first dose of the series can be
given before 6 months of age). Rotavirus vaccine, like
other vaccines, can be administered to infants with minor
illnesses and low grade fever.
The safety and efficacy of RRV-TV in children with pre-
existing chronic gastrointestinal conditions, such as
congenital malabsorption syndromes, Hirschsprung's
disease, or short-gut syndrome, has not been determined.
The decision to vaccinate children with these conditions
must be made on a case-by-case basis.
Very limited data on the safety and immunogenicity of RRV-
TV in premature infants (<37 weeks gestational age) are
available. There is concern that premature infants may have
a lower level of passive maternal antibody to rotavirus, and,
Rotavirus Vaccine and as a result, may be at increased risk of fever following

ArCTAVIRUS
Vaccine Storage and Handling
RRV-TV is supplied as individual doses of lyophilized
(freeze-dried) vaccine. A separate pouch contains a plastic
dispette containing 2.5 ml of citrate-bicarbonate buffer
diluent for reconstitution of the powdered vaccine.
Neither the vaccine nor the diluent contain a preservative.
Only the buffer diluent supplied with the vaccine may
be used to reconstitute RRV-TV. Only one dose of
vaccine should be reconstituted at a time. Reconstitution
of multiple doses because of anticipated use later in the
immunization session should be avoided because of lability
of the vaccine virus after reconstitution.
Unreconstituted (lyophilized) vaccine is stable for at least 24
months when stored at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F). The vaccine does
not require refrigeration, but may be kept in a refrigerator (2°-
8°C (36°-45°F]) if ambient temperature is anticipated to
exceed 25°C (77°F). The diluent should be stored at 2°-25°C
(36°-77°F). The vaccine and diluent must not be frozen.
After reconstitution with citrate-bicarbonate buffer diluent,
the vaccine is stable for up to 60 minutes at room
temperature (up to 27°C (81°F]), and up to 4 hours at
refrigerator temperature (2°-8°C (36°-45°F]). After 60
minutes at room temperature, or 4 hours at refrigerator
temperature, the reconstituted vaccine must be discarded. If
a dose of vaccine that has been incorrectly stored or handled
(such as vaccine that is expired or has been frozen, or
reconstituted vaccine kept for more than 60 minutes at room
temperature or 4 hours at refrigerator temperature) is
inadvertently administered, the dose should not be counted
as part of the series. The dose should be repeated at the
earliest opportunity.
Rotavirus Surveillance
Rotavirus gastroenteritis is not a nationally reportable
disease and testing for rotavirus infection is not often
performed when a child seeks medical care for acute
gastroenteritis. Current national surveillance includes
review of national hospital discharge databases for rotavirus-
specific or rotavirus-compatible diagnoses, and review of
reports of rotavirus isolation from a sentinel system of
laboratories. Additional surveillance systems will be
needed to provide the timely representative data
necessary for monitoring the effectiveness of a national
immunization program. At state and local levels,
additional surveillance efforts—by enhanced surveillance
at sentinel hospitals or by review of hospital discharge
databases—will be required to monitor program
effectiveness.

Hoemophilus
influenzde type b
MOPHILUS INFLUENZAE WAS FIRST DESCRIBED BY PFEIFFER
in 1892. During a major outbreak of influenza, he
found the bacteria in the sputum of patients, and
proposed a causal association between this species and
the clinical syndrome known as influenza.
The organism was given the name Haemophilus by
Winslow, et al., in 1920. It was not until 1933 that Smith,
et al., established that influenza was caused by a virus and
that H. influenzae was a cause of secondary infection.
In the 1930s, Margaret Pittman showed that H. influenzae
could be isolated in encapsulated and unencapsulated
forms. She identified six capsular types (a-f), and
observed that virtually all isolates from cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) and blood were of the capsular type b.
Before the introduction of effective vaccines, H. influenzae
type b (Hib) was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis
and other invasive bacterial disease among children -5
years of age. Almost all serious Hib infections were
among children -5 years of age; approximately one in 200
children developed invasive Hib disease before the age of
5 years. Two-thirds of cases were among children -18
months of age.
Haemophilus influenzae
Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative coccobacillus.
It is generally aerobic, but can grow as a facultative
anaerobe. In vitro growth requires accessory growth
factors. These include “X” factor (hemin) and “V” factor
(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD]).
Chocolate agar media are used for isolation. H. influenzae
will generally not grow on blood agar, which lacks NAD.

120 HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE B
Haemophilus influenzae
Agent Summary
• Anaerobic gram-negative coccobacilius
• Polysaccharide capsule responsible for virulence
and immunity
• Six different serotypes (a-ſ) of polysaccharide
capsule
• 96% of invasive disease caused by type b
• Nontypable strains colonize the respiratory tract;
major cause of otitis media and bronchitis
Haemophilus influenzae type b
Pathogenesis of Invasive Disease
• Organisms colonize nasopharynx
• Organisms invade bloodstream and
cause distant infection
• Antecedent URI may be a contributing
factor
The outermost structure of H. influenzae is composed of
polyribosyl-ribitol phosphate (PRP), a polysaccharide,
which is responsible for virulence and immunity. Six
antigenically and biochemically distinct capsular
polysaccharide serotypes have been described, which are
designated types a through f. Type b organisms account
for 95% of all strains that cause invasive disease.
Pathogenesis
The organism enters the body through the nasopharynx.
Organisms colonize the nasopharynx and may remain only
transiently or for several months in the absence of
symptoms (“asymptomatic carrier"). Hib strains occur in
the nasopharynx with a prevalence of 0.5%-3% in normal
infants and children, uncommonly in adults. Nontypable
(unencapsulated) strains are also frequent inhabitants of
the human respiratory tract and are generally non-invasive.
In some persons the organism causes an invasive
infection. The exact mode of invasion to the blood stream
is unknown. Antecedent viral or mycoplasma infection of
the upper respiratory tract may be a contributing factor.
The bacteria spread in the bloodstream to distant sites in
the body. Meninges are especially likely to be affected.
The most striking feature of Hib disease is age-
dependent susceptibility. Passive protection of some
infants is provided by transplacentally acquired maternal
IgG antibodies and breast-feeding during the first 6
months of life. Peak attack rates occur at 6-7 months of
age, declining thereafter. Hib disease is uncommon
beyond 5 years of age. The presumed reason for this age
distribution is the acquisition of humoral immunity to Hib
with increasing age.
Antibodies to Hib capsular polysaccharide are protective.
The precise level of antibody required for protection
against invasive disease is not clearly established.
However, a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 1 mg/mL 3
weeks postvaccination correlated with protection in
studies following vaccination with unconjugated PRP
vaccine and suggested long-term protection from invasive
disease.
Acquisition of both anticapsular and serum bactericidal
antibody is inversely related to the age-specific incidence
of Hib disease.




## p. 121 (#133) ############################################

ATAEMOPHILLS INFLUENZAE TYPE B
In the pre-vaccine era, most children acquired “natural”
immunity by 5-6 years of age through asymptomatic
infection by Hib bacteria. Since only a relatively small
proportion of children carry Hib at any time, it has been
postulated that exposure to organisms that share common
antigenic structures with the capsule of Hib (so-called
“cross-reacting organisms") may also stimulate the
development of anticapsular antibodies against Hib.
Natural exposure to Hib also induces antibodies to outer
membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharides, and other
antigens on the surface of the bacterium.
The genetic constitution of the host may also be important
in susceptibility to infection with Hib. Risk for Hib
disease has been associated with a number of genetic
markers, but the mechanism of these associations is
unknown. No single genetic relationship regulating
susceptibility or immune responses to polysaccharide
antigens has yet been convincingly demonstrated.
Clinical Features
Invasive disease caused by H. influenzae type b can affect
many organ systems. The most common types of invasive
disease are meningitis, epiglottitis, pneumonia, arthritis,
and cellulitis.
Meningitis is infection of the membranes covering the
brain and is the most common clinical manifestation of
invasive Hib disease, accounting for 50%-65% of cases.
Hallmarks of Hib meningitis are fever, decreased mental
status, and stiff neck. The mortality rate is 2%-5%,
despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Neurologic
sequelae occur in 15%-30% of survivors.
Epiglottitis is an infection and swelling of the epiglottis,
the tissue in the throat that covers and protects the larynx
during swallowing. Epiglottitis may cause life-threatening
airway obstruction.
Septic arthritis (joint infection), cellulitis (rapidly
progressing skin infection which usually involves face,
head, or neck), and pneumonia (which can be mild focal
or severe empyema) are common manifestations of
invasive disease.
Osteomyelitis (bone infection), and pericarditis
(infection of the sac covering the heart) are less common
forms of invasive disease.

HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE B
Haemophilus influenzae type b
Treatment
• Immediate therapy with chloramphenicol
or an effective 3rd generation cephalosporin
• Ampicillin-resistant strains now common
throughout United States
- Hospitalization required
Otitis media and acute bronchitis due to H. influenzae are
generally caused by nontypable strains. Hib strains account
for only 5%-10% of H. influenzae causing otitis media.
The case-fatality rate for invasive H. influenzae disease is
2% to 5%.
Laboratory Diagnosis
A gram stain of an infected body fluid may demonstrate
small gram-negative coccobacilli suggestive of invasive
Haemophilus disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood,
pleural fluid, joint fluid, and middle ear aspirates should
be cultured on the appropriate media. A positive culture
for Haemophilus influenzae establishes the diagnosis.
All isolates of Haemophilus influenzae should be
serotyped. This is an extremely important laboratory
procedure that should be performed on every isolate of
Haemophilus influenzae, especially those obtained from
children -15 years of age. This test determines whether
an isolate is type b, and is important because only type b is
potentially vaccine preventable. Serotyping is usually
done by either the state health department laboratory or a
reference laboratory.
Antigen detection may be used as an adjunct to culture,
particularly in the diagnosis of patients who have been
partially treated with antimicrobials and the organism
may not be viable on culture. Two types are available.
Latex agglutination is a rapid, sensitive, and
specific method to detect Hib capsular polysaccharide
antigen in CSF, serum, urine, pleural fluid, joint fluid, etc.
Counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) is similar to
latex aglutination, but is less sensitive, takes longer, and is
more difficult to perform.
Medical Management
Hospitalization is generally required. Antimicrobial
therapy with chloramphenicol or an effective third-
generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone)
should be begun immediately. Treatment course is usually
10 to 14 days.
Ampicillin-resistant strains of Hib are now common
throughout the United States. Thus, children with life-
threatening illness in which Hib may be the etiologic agent
should not receive ampicillin as initial empiric therapy.

FIAE/MOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE B
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Hib disease occurs worldwide. However, the incidence
outside the United States and Europe has not been
determined.
Reservoir
Humans are the only known reservoir. Hib does not
survive in the environment on inanimate surfaces.
Transmission
Primary mode is presumably by respiratory droplet
spread, although firm evidence for this mechanism is
lacking.
Temporal pattern
Several studies have described a bimodal seasonal pattern
in the United States, with one peak between September
and December, and a second peak between March and
May. The reason for this bimodal pattern is not known.
Communicability
The contagious potential of invasive Hib disease is
considered to be limited. However, certain circumstances,
particularly close contact with a case (e.g., household, day-
care, or institutional setting) can lead to outbreaks or
direct secondary transmission of the disease.
Secular Trends in the United States
Haemophilus influenzae infections became nationally
reportable in 1991. Serotype-specific reporting continues
to be incomplete. However, most reported infections
probably represent type b disease.
Prior to the availability of national reporting data, several
areas carried out active surveillance for H. influenzae
disease, which allowed estimates of disease nationwide. In
the early 1980s, it was estimated that about 20,000 cases
occurred annually in the United States, primarily among
children younger than 5 years of age (40-50 cases per 100,000
population). The incidence of invasive Hib disease began to
fall dramatically in the late 1980s, coincident with licensure
of conjugate Hib vaccines. In 1997, only 258 cases of invasive
Haemophilus influenzae type b disease were reported among
children less than 5 years of age (1.3 per 100,000 children)
This decrease was due to increasing levels of vaccine-
induced immunity among young children.

rate of carriage of Hib among vaccinated children,
therefore decreasing the chance that unvaccinated
children will be exposed.
Incidence is strikingly age-dependent. Up to 60% of
invasive disease occurs before age 12 months, with a peak
occurrence in children 6-11 months of age. Children over
60 months of age account for <10% of invasive disease.
In 1996-1997, approximately 48% of children less than 5
years of age with confirmed invasive Hib disease were less
than 6 months of age, and too young to have completed a
three-dose primary vaccination series. Fifty-two percent
were age 6 months or older, and were eligible to have
completed the primary vaccination series. Of these age-
eligible children, 64% were either incompletely vaccinated
or their vaccination status was unknown.
In 1996-1997, 5 (4%) of 115 children with known outcome
died. All children who died were less than 6 months of
age, and had received one or no Hib vaccine doses.
Risk factors for Hib disease include host factors and
exposure factors that increase the likelihood of exposure
to Hib. Exposure factors include household crowding,
large household size, day-care attendance, low
socioeconomic status, low parental education levels, and
school-aged siblings. Host factors include race/ethnicity
(elevated risk in blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans —
possibly confounded by socioeconomic variables that are
associated with both race/ethnicity and Hib disease),
chronic diseases (e.g., sickle cell anemia, antibody
deficiency syndromes, malignancies, especially during
chemotherapy), and possibly gender (male > female).
Protective factors (effect limited to <6 months of age)
include breast-feeding and passively acquired maternal
antibody.
Secondary Hib disease is defined as illness within 1-60
days following contact with an ill child, and accounts for
less than 5% of all invasive Hib disease. Among
household contacts, six studies have found a secondary
attack rate of 0.3% in the month following disease onset of
the index case, which is about 600-fold higher than the
risk for the general population. Attack rates varied
substantially with age, from 3.7% among children under 2
years of age to 0% among contacts over the age of 6 years.
In these household contacts, 64% of secondary cases
occurred within the first week (excluding the first 24

hours) of disease onset in the index case, 20% during the
second week, and 16% during the third and fourth weeks.
There are conflicting data regarding the risk of secondary
transmission among day-care contacts. Secondary
attack rates have varied from 0% to as high as 2.7%. Most
studies seem to suggest that day-care contacts are at
relatively low risk for secondary transmission of Hib
disease.

of a T-independent antigen, most notably an age-

observed with repeated doses, the antibody which was
produced was relatively low-affinity IgM, and switching to
IgG production was poor.

Conjugation is the process of chemically bonding a
polysaccharide (a poor antigen) to a protein “carrier,”
which is a more effective antigen. This process changes
the polysaccharide from a T-independent to a T-dependent
antigen, and greatly improves immunogenicity,
particularly in young children. In addition, repeat doses
of Hib conjugate vaccines elicit booster responses, and
allow maturation of class-specific immunity with
predominance of IgG antibody. The Hib conjugates also
cause carrier priming and elicit antibody to “useful”
carrier protein.

Since 1990, four additional conjugate Hib vaccines have
been licensed for use in infants as young as 6 weeks of age.
Three of these vaccines are chemically and
immunologically distinct (ActPIIB and OmniFIIB are
identical vaccines marketed by different companies).

Hib vaccine is immunogenic in patients with increased risk

leukemia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,
and in those who have had splenectomies. However, in
persons with HIV infection, immunogenicity varies with
stage of infection and degree of immunocompromise.
Efficacy studies have not been performed in populations
with increased risk of invasive disease.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
All infants, including those born prematurely, should
receive a primary series of conjugate Hib vaccine
(separate or in combination), beginning at 2 months of age.
The number of doses in the primary series depends on the
type of vaccine used. A primary series of PRP-OMP
(PedvaxHIB) vaccine is two doses; HbOC (HibTiTER) and
PRP-T (ActPIIB) require a three-dose primary series (See
table below). A booster is recommended at 12-15 months
regardless of which vaccine is used for the primary series.

HbOC or PRP-T
Previously unvaccinated infants aged 2-6 months should
receive three doses of vaccine administered 2 months
apart, followed by a booster dose at age 12-15 months, at
least 2 months after the last vaccination. Unvaccinated
children aged 7-11 months should receive two doses of
vaccine, 2 months apart, followed by a booster dose at age
12-18 months, at least 2 months after the last vaccination.
Unvaccinated children aged 12-14 months should receive
two doses of vaccine, at least 2 months apart. Any
previously unvaccinated child aged 15-59 months should
receive a single dose of vaccine.
PRP-OMP
Unvaccinated children aged 2-11 months should receive
two doses of vaccine, 2 months apart, followed by a booster
dose at 12-18 months of age, at least 2 months after the
last dose. Unvaccinated children aged 12-14 months
should receive two doses of vaccine, 2 months apart. Any
previously unvaccinated child 15-59 months of age should
receive a single dose of vaccine.
PRP-D
One dose of PRP-D may be administered to unvaccinated
children aged 15-59 months. This vaccine may be used as
a booster dose at 12-18 months of age following a two- or
three-dose primary series, regardless of the vaccine used
in the primary series. This vaccine is not licensed for use
among infants because of its limited immunogenicity and
variable protective efficacy in this age group.
Children with a lapsed Hib immunization series (that is,
children who have received one or more doses of Hib-
containing vaccine but are not up-to-date for their age)
may not need all the remaining doses of a 3 or 4 dose
series. Like children who are late starting the series, the
number of doses depends on the child's current age.
The ACIP does not address the issue of vaccination of
children with a lapsed Hib series. However, the 1997

In general, children >59 months of age do not need Hib
vaccination. The majority of these children are immune to
Hib, probably from asymptomatic infection as infants.
However, some older children and adults are at increased
risk for invasive Hib disease and may be vaccinated. These
high risk persons include those with functional or anatomic
asplenia (e.g., sickle cell disease, postsplenectomy),
immunodeficiency (in particular, persons with IgG2
subclass deficiency), immunosuppression from cancer
chemotherapy, and infection with human immunodeficiency
virus. Previously unvaccinated persons >59 months of age
with one of these high risk conditions should be given at
least one dose of any licensed Hib conjugate vaccine.
Combination Vaccines
Several manufacturers have included Hib vaccine in
combination with other vaccines. As of January 1999,
there are 2 licensed vaccines that include whole cell DTP Combination Vaccines
and Hib (Tetramune” and ActPIIB/DTPTM), one licensed e Whole cell DTP - Hib

combination DTaP-Hib vaccine has been licensed for the
primary series in infants. As a result, combination whole
cell pertussis - Hib vaccines (Tetramune", ActPIIB/DTPTM)
should be used only when acellular pertussis vaccine is
not available or when the use of separate injections of
DTaP and single antigen Hib is not feasible. The schedule
for these combination vaccines is the same as for HbOC/
PRP-T vaccines. Previously unvaccinated infants aged 2-6
months should receive three doses administered at least 2
months apart. An additional dose should be administered
at 12-15 months of age, after at least a 6-month interval
following the third dose.

TriHIBitTM
As of January 1999, only one combination of DTaP
(acellular pertussis) and Hib (TriBIBit")has been
licensed. This vaccine is currently licensed only for
the fourth dose of the DTP-Hib series, after the child
has been immunologically primed with Hib antigen,
either with single antigen Hib vaccine or with a whole cell
DTP-Hib combination. Available data suggest that when a
DTaP-Hib combination vaccine is given as the initial
(priming) doses, response to the Hib component is
significantly reduced. This vaccine should not be used for
any of the first three doses of the Hib series until it has
been approved for this use by the Food and Drug
Administration.
Infants who receive TriBIBit for any of the first three
doses of the Hib series may not be protected against
invasive Hib disease. Doses of TriBIBit given to an infant
as the first, second, or third dose of the Hib series should
be disregarded, and not counted as part of the Hib series.
The child should be revaccinated with a single antigen
conjugate Hib vaccine as appropriate for their age using
the lapsed immunization guidelines (see above). The
DTaP component does not need to be repeated.
COMVAXTM
COMVAX" is a combination hepatitis B-Hib vaccine,
licensed in October 1996. The vaccine contains a standard
dose of PRP-OMP (PedvaxHIB"), and 5 micrograms of
Merck's hepatitis B vaccine. COMVAX" is licensed for use
when both antigens are indicated. However, Hib vaccine
should not be given to infants <6 weeks of age because of
the potential of immune tolerance to the Hib antigen.
COMVAX" should not be used in infants <6 weeks of
age (i.e., the birth dose of hepatitis B, or a dose at one
month of age, if the infant is on a 0-1-6 schedule).
COMVAX" is not licensed for infants whose mothers are
known to be hepatitis B surface antigen positive (i.e.,
acute or chronic infection with hepatitis B virus).
However, the vaccine contains the same dose of Merck's
hepatitis B vaccine recommended for these infants, so
response to the hepatitis B component of COMVAX*
should be adequate.

Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
Adverse events following Hib conjugate vaccines are
uncommon. Swelling, redness, and/or pain have been
reported in 5%-30% of recipients and usually resolve within
12-24 hours. Systemic reactions such as fever and
irritability are infrequent. Available information on
adverse events suggests that the risks for local and
systemic events following Tetramune" and ActPIIB/DTP*
administration are similar to those following concurrent
administration of its individual component vaccines, and
are probably due to the pertussis component of the DTP
vaccine.
All serious adverse events that occur after receipt of any
vaccine should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Events
Reporting System (VAERS).
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Vaccination with Hib conjugate vaccine is contraindicated
in persons known to have experienced anaphylaxis
following a prior dose of that vaccine. Vaccination should
be delayed in children with moderate or severe acute
illnesses. Minor illnesses (e.g., mild upper-respiratory
infection) are not contraindications to vaccination.
Contraindications and precautions for the use of
Tetramune", ActFIIB/DTPTM, TriBIBitTM and COMVAXTM
are the same as those for its individual component
vaccines (i.e., DTP, DTaP, Hib, and hepatitis B).
Vaccine Storage and Handling
All Hib conjugate vaccines should be shipped in insulated
containers to prevent freezing. Unreconstituted or liquid
vaccine should be stored at refrigeraor temperature (2°-8°C
[35°-46°F]). Hib vaccine must not be frozen. Hib vaccines
are stable for 30 days after reconstitution if the vaccine is
stored at refrigerator temperature. Opened multidose
vials may be used until the expiration date printed on the
package if they are not contaminated. ActPHIB" and
TriBIBitTM should be used within 24 hours of
reconstitution.
Surveillance and Reporting of Hib Disease
Invasive Hib disease is a reportable condition in most
states. All health care workers should report any case of
invasive Hib disease to local and state health departments.

HAE/MOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE B
Rifampin Prophylaxis
Several studies have shown that rifampin eradicated Hib
carriage in 295% of contacts of primary Hib cases,
including children in day-care facilities.
Contacts who develop symptoms suggestive of invasive
Hib disease, such as fever or headache, should be
evaluated promptly.
Rifampin chemoprophylaxis for household contacts is no
longer indicated if all contacts aged “4 years are fully
vaccinated against Hib disease. A child is considered fully
immunized against Hib disease following (a) at least one
dose of conjugate vaccine at 15 months of age; (b) two doses of
conjugate vaccine at 12-14 months of age; or (c) two or more
doses of conjugate vaccine at “12 months of age, followed by a
booster dose at 12 months of age. In households with one or
more infants <12 months of age (regardless of vaccination
status) or with a child aged 1-3 years who is inadequately
vaccinated, all household contacts should receive rifampin
prophylaxis following a case of invasive Hib disease that
occurs in any family member. The recommended dose is 20
mg/kg as a single daily dose (maximal daily dose 600 mg) for
4 days. Neonates (<1 month of age) should receive 10 mg/kg
once daily for 4 days.
The use of rifampin in day-care classrooms is
controversial. If a case of Hib disease has occurred, and any
children less than 2 years of age have been exposed, all
parents should be notified. Although data on risk are not
optimal, all students (regardless of age) and staff in the
classroom should receive rifampin prophylaxis according to
the above regimen. However, rifampin prophylaxis is not
necessary if all children ‘4 years of age are fully immunized.
Rifampin is contraindicated in pregnant women, as its
effect on the fetus has not been established and it is
teratogenic in laboratory animals.
Rifampin prophylaxis should be instituted as rapidly as
possible. If more than 14 days have passed since the last
contact with the index case, the benefit of rifampin
prophylaxis is likely to be decreased.
The index case should be treated with the same rifampin
regimen before discharge from the hospital, since
antimicrobials used to treat invasive disease do not
reliably eradicate carriage.
Children in day-care classrooms who are to receive
chemoprophylaxis and who have received the Hib vaccine
should also receive rifampin. However, if all children ‘4
years of age are fully immunized, chemoprophylaxis is not
necessary.

EASLES IS ANACUTE VIRAL INFECTIOUS DISEASE. THERE ARE
references to measles as far back as the 7th
century A.D. The disease was described by
Rhazes in the 10th Century A.D. as “more dreaded than
smallpox.”
In 1846, Peter Panum described the incubation period of
measles and lifelong immunity. Enders and Peebles
isolated the virus in human and monkey kidney tissue
culture in 1954. The first live attenuated vaccine was
licensed for use in the U.S. in 1963 (Edmonston B strain).
Measles Virus
The measles virus is a paramyxovirus, genus
Morbillivirus. It is 100 to 200nm in diameter, with a core
of single-stranded RNA, and is closely related to the
rinderpest and canine distemper viruses. Measles virus
has six structural proteins, of which three are complexed
to the RNA and three are associated with the viral
membrane envelope. Two of the membrane envelope
proteins are most important in pathogenesis. They are the
F (fusion) protein, which is responsible for fusion of virus
and host cell membranes, viral penetration, and
hemolysis, and the H (hemagglutinin) protein which is
responsible for adsorption of virus to cells.
There is only one antigenic type of measles virus.
Although recent studies have documented changes in the
H glycoprotein, these changes do not appear to be
epidemiologically important (i.e., no change in vaccine
efficacy has been observed).
Measles virus is rapidly inactivated by heat, light, acidic
pH, ether, and trypsin. It has a short survival time (<2
hours) in the air, or on objects and surfaces.

136. MEASLES
Pathogenesis
Measles is a systemic infection. The primary site of
infection is the respiratory epithelium of the nasopharynx.
Two to three days after invasion and replication in the
respiratory epithelium and regional lymph nodes, a
primary viremia occurs with subsequent infection of the
reticuloendothelial system. Following further viral
replication in regional and distal reticuloendothelial sites,
there is a second viremia, which occurs 5 to 7 days after
initial infection. During this viremia, there may be
infection of the respiratory tract and other organs.
Measles virus is shed from the nasopharynx beginning
with the prodrome until 3-4 days after rash onset.
Clinical Features
The incubation period of measles, from exposure to
prodrome averages 10-12 days. From exposure to rash
onset averages 14 days (range, 7-18 days).
The prodrome lasts 2-4 days (range 1-7 days). It is
characterized by fever, which increases in stepwise
fashion, often peaking as high as 103°-105°F. This is
followed by the onset of cough, coryza (runny nose), and/or
conjunctivitis.
Koplik's spots, an exanthem present on mucous
membranes, is considered to be pathognomonic for
measles. It occurs 1-2 days before the rash to 1-2 days
after the rash, and appears as punctate blue-white spots
on the bright red background of the buccal mucosa.
The measles rash is a maculopapular eruption that
usually lasts 5-6 days. It begins at the hairline, then
involves the face and upper neck. Over the next 3 days,
the rash gradually proceeds downward and outward,
reaching the hands and feet.
The maculopapular lesions are generally discrete, but may
become confluent, particularly on the upper body.
Initially, lesions blanch with fingertip pressure. By 3-4
days, most do not blanch with pressure. Fine
desauamation occurs over more severely involved areas.
The rash fades in the same order that it appears, from
head to extremities.
Other symptoms of measles include anorexia, diarrhea,
especially in infants, and generalized lymphadenopathy.

Complications
Approximately 30% of reported measles cases have one or
more complications. Complications of measles are more
common among children -5 and adults -20 years of age.
From 1985 through 1992, diarrhea was reported in 8% of
reported cases, making this the most commonly reported
complication of measles. Otitis media was reported in 7%
of reported cases and occurs almost exclusively in children.
Pneumonia (6% of reported cases) may be viral or
superimposed bacterial, and is the most common cause of
death.
Acute encephalitis is reported in approximately 0.1% of
reported cases. Onset generally occurs 6 days after rash
onset (range 1-15 days), and is characterized by fever,
headache, vomiting, stiff neck, meningeal irritation,
drowsiness, convulsions, and coma. Cerebrospinal fluid
shows pleocytosis and elevated protein. Case fatality rate
can approximately 15%. Some form of residual neurologic
damage occurs in as many as 25%. Seizures (with or
without fever) are reported in 0.6% to 0.7% of reported cases.
Death from measles has been reported in approximately
1-2 per 1,000 reported cases in the United States in recent
years. As with other complications of measles, the risk of
death is higher among young children and adults.
Pneumonia accounts for about 60% of deaths. The most
common causes of death are pneumonia in children and
acute encephalitis in adults.
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare
degenerative central nervous system disease believed to
be due to persistent measles virus infection of the brain.
Average onset occurs 7 years after measles (range 1
month-27 years), and occurs in five to ten cases per million
reported measles cases. The onset is insidious, with
progressive deterioration of behavior and intellect,
followed by ataxia (awkwardness), myoclonic seizures, and
eventually death. SSPE has been extremely rare since the
early 1980s.
Measles illness during pregnancy results in a higher
risk of premature labor, spontaneous abortion, and low-
birth-weight infants. Birth defects (with no definable
pattern of malformation) have been reported rarely,
without confirmation that measles was the cause.

Atypical measles occurs only in persons who received
inactivated (“killed”) measles vaccine (KMV) and are
subsequently exposed to wild-type measles virus. Between
600,000 and 900,000 persons received KMV in the U.S. from
1963 to 1967. KMV sensitized the recipient to measles
virus antigens without providing protection. Subsequent
infection with measles virus leads to signs of
hypersensitivity polyserositis. The illness is characterized
by fever, pneumonia, pleural effusions, and edema.
The rash is usually maculopapular or petechial, but may
have urticarial, purpuric, or vesicular components. It
appears first on the wrists or ankles. Atypical measles
may be prevented by revaccinating with live measles
vaccine. Moderate to severe local reactions with or
without fever may follow vaccination; these reactions are
less severe than with infection with wild measles virus.
Modified measles occurs primarily in patients who
received immune globulin (IG) as post-exposure
prophylaxis and in young infants who have some residual
maternal antibody. It is usually characterized by a
prolonged incubation period, mild prodrome, and sparse,
discrete rash of short duration. Similar mild illness has
been reported among previously vaccinated persons.
Rarely reported in the United States, hemorrhagic
measles is characterized by high fever (105°-106°F),
seizures, delirium, respiratory distress, and hemorrhage
into the skin and mucous membranes.
Measles in an immunocompromised person may be
severe, with a prolonged course. It is reported almost
exclusively in persons with T-cell deficiencies (certain
leukemias, lymphomas, and Acquired Immunodeficiency
Syndrome [AIDS]). It may occur without the typical rash,
and a patient may shed virus for several weeks after the
acute illness.
Measles in developing countries has resulted in high
attack rates among children “12 months of age. Measles is
more severe in malnourished children, particularly those
with vitamin A deficiency. Complications include
diarrhea, dehydration, stomatitis, inability to feed, and
bacterial infections (skin and elsewhere). The case fatality
rate may be as high as 25%. Measles is also a leading
cause of blindness in African children.

/MEASLES
Laboratory Diagnosis
Isolation of measles virus is not recommended as a
routine method to diagnose measles. However, virus
isolates are extremely important for molecular
epidemiologic surveillance to help determine the
geographic origin of the virus and the viral strains
circulating in the United States.
Measles virus can be isolated from urine, nasopharyngeal
aspirates, heparinized blood, or throat swabs. Specimens
for virus culture should be obtained from every clinically
suspected case of measles and should be shipped to the
state public health laboratory or CDC, at the direction of
the state health department. Clinical specimens for viral
isolation should be collected at the same time as samples
taken for serologic testing. Because the virus is more
likely to be isolated when the specimens are collected
within 3 days of rash onset, collection of specimens for
virus isolation should not be delayed until serologic
confirmation is obtained. Clinical specimens should be
obtained within 7 days of rash onset, and should not be
collected more than 10 days after rash onset. A detailed
protocol for collection of specimens for viral isolation is
included at the end of this chapter.
Serologic testing, most commonly by enzyme-linked
immunoassay (ELISA or EIA), is widely available and may
be diagnostic if done at the appropriate time. Generally, a
previously susceptible person exposed to either vaccine or
wild type measles virus will first mount an IgM response
and then an IgG response. The IgM response will be
transient (1–2 months) and the IgG response should
persist for many years. Uninfected persons should be IgM
negative and will be either IgG negative or IgG positive
depending upon their previous infection history.
ELISA tests for IgM antibody require only a single serum
specimen and are diagnostic if positive. The preferred
reference test is a capture IgM test developed by CDC.
This test should be used to confirm every case of measles
that is reported to have some other type of laboratory
confirmation. IgM capture tests for measles are often
positive on the day of rash onset. However, in the first 72
hours after rash onset, up to 20% of tests for IgM may give
false-negative results. Tests that are negative in the first
72 hours after rash onset should be repeated. IgM is
detectable for at least 28 days after rash onset and
frequently longer.
Measles
Laboratory Diagnosis
• Isolation of measles virus from clinical specimen
(e.g., nasopharynx, urine)
• Significant rise in measles lgG by any standard
serologic assay (e.g., enzyme immunoassay,
hemagglutination inhibition)
• Poeltive serologic test for measles IgM antibody

A variety of tests for IgG antibodies to measles are
available and include ELISA tests, hemagglutination
inhibition, indirect fluorescent antibody tests,
microneutralization, and plaque reduction neutralization.
Complement fixation, while widely used in the past, is no
longer recommended.
IgG testing for measles requires the demonstration of a rise
in the titer of antibody against measles virus, so two serum
specimens are always required. The first specimen should
be drawn as soon after rash onset as possible. The second
specimen should be drawn 10–30 days later. The tests for
IgG antibody should be conducted on both specimens at the
same time. The same type of test should be used on both
specimens. The specific criteria for documenting an
increase in titer depends on the test. ELISA values are not
titers and increases in ELISA values do not directly
correspond to four-fold or greater titer rises.
Tests for IgG antibody require two serum specimens and a
confirmed diagnosis cannot be made until the second
specimen is obtained. As a result, IgM tests are generally
preferred.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Measles occurs throughout the world.
Reservoir
Measles is a human disease. There is no known animal
reservoir, and an asymptomatic carrier state has not been
documented.
Transmission
Measles transmission is primarily person to person via
large respiratory droplets. Airborne transmission via
aerosolized droplet nuclei has been documented in closed
areas (e.g., office examination room) for up to 2 hours after
a person with measles occupied the area.
Temporal pattern
In temperate areas, measles disease occurs primarily in
the late winter and spring.

/MEASLES
Communicability
Measles is highly communicable, with >90% secondary
attack rates among susceptible persons. Measles may be
transmitted from 4 days prior to 4 days after rash onset.
Maximum communicability occurs from onset of prodrome
through the first 3-4 days of rash.
Secular Trends in the United States
Before 1963, approximately 500,000 cases and 500 deaths
were reported annually with epidemic cycles every 2-3
years. However, the actual number of cases was estimated
at 3-4 million annually. More than 50% of persons had
measles by age 6 and more than 90% had measles by age
15. The highest incidence was in 5-9 year-olds, who
generally accounted for more than 50% of reported cases.
Following licensure of vaccine in 1963, the incidence of
measles decreased by more than 98%, and 2-3 year
epidemic cycles no longer occurred. Because of this
success, a 1978 Measles Elimination Program set a goal to
eliminate indigenous measles by October 1, 1982 (26,871
cases were reported in 1978). The 1982 elimination goal
was not met, but in 1983, only 1,497 cases were reported
(0.6 cases per 100,000 population), the lowest annual total
ever reported up to that time.
The incidence of measles increased annually after 1983, to
6,282 cases (2.6/100,000 population) in 1986, and decreased
slightly to approximately 3,500 cases (1.5 per 100,000
population) in 1987-1988.
During 1980-1988, a median of 57% of reported cases were
among school-aged persons (5-19 years of age), and a
median of 29% were among children -5 years of age. A
median of 8% of cases were among infants <1 year of age.
From 1985 through 1988, 42% of cases occurred in persons
who were vaccinated on or after their first birthdays.
During these years, 68% of cases in school-aged children
(5-19 years) had been appropriately vaccinated. The
occurence of measles among previously vaccinated
children led to the recommendation for a second dose in
this age group.
From 1980 through 1988, a median of two measles-
associated deaths per year were reported, for a median
death-to-case ratio of 0.64 deaths per 1,000 reported cases.

Measles resurgence in 1989-1991
In 1989 through 1991, a dramatic increase in cases
occurred. During these 3 years a total of 55,622 cases were
reported (18,193 in 1989; 27,786 in 1990; 9,643 in 1991). In
addition to the increased number of cases, a change in age
distribution of cases occurred. Prior to the resurgence,
school-aged children had accounted for the largest
proportion of reported cases. During the resurgence, 45%
of all reported cases were in children -5 years of age. In
1990, 48% of patients were in this age group, the first time
that the proportion of cases in children -5 years of age
exceeded the proportion of cases in 5-19-year-olds.
Thirty-five percent of cases were among school-aged
persons (5-19 years old).
Overall incidence rates were highest for Hispanics and
blacks and lowest for non-Hispanic whites. Among
children -5 years of age the incidence of measles among
blacks and Hispanics was four to seven times higher than
among non-Hispanic whites.
A total of 123 measles-associated deaths were reported
(death-to-case ratio = 2.2 per 1,000 cases). Forty-nine
percent of deaths were among children -5 years of age.
Ninety percent of fatal cases had no history of vaccination.
Sixty-four deaths were reported in 1990, the largest
annual number of deaths from measles since 1971.
The most important cause of the measles resurgence of
1989-1991 was low vaccination coverage. Measles vaccine
coverage was low in many cities, including some that
experienced large outbreaks among preschool-aged
children throughout the early to mid-1980s. Surveys in
areas experiencing preschool-type measles outbreaks
indicated that as few as 50% of children had been
vaccinated against measles by their second birthdays, and
that black and Hispanic children were less likely to be
age-appropriately vaccinated than white children.
Measles susceptibility of infants less than one year of age
may have increased. During the 1989-1991 measles
resurgence, incidence rates for infants were more than
twice as high as those in any other age group. The
mothers of many infants who developed measles were
young, and their measles immunity was most often due to
vaccination rather than infection with wild virus. As a
result, a smaller amount of antibody was transferred
across the placenta to the fetus, compared with antibody
transfer from mothers who had higher antibody titers
resulting from wild virus infection. The lower quantity of
antibody resulted in immunity that waned more rapidly,
making infants susceptible at a younger age than in the
past.






## p. 143 (#155) ############################################

/MEASLES
The increase in measles in 1989-1991 was not limited to
the United States. Large outbreaks of measles were
reported by many other countries of North and Central
America, including Canada, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, and Nicaragua.
Measles in 1993-1998
Reported cases of measles declined rapidly after the 1989-
1991 resurgence. This decline was due primarily to
intensive efforts to vaccinate preschool-aged children.
Measles vaccination levels among 2 year-old children
increased from 70% in 1990 to 91% in 1997.
Since 1993, fewer than 1000 cases have been reported
annually. Available data strongly suggest that measles
transmission was completely interrupted. Many cases are
now imported from other countries, or linked to imported
cases. Most imported cases originate in Europe and Asia.
Due to an aggressive measles vaccination program by the
Pan American Health Organization, measles incidence is
now very low in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Measles elimination from the Americas appears to be an
achievable goal.
Measles incidence increased to 963 cases in 1994, due
primarily to several large outbreaks among persons with
religious and philosophic exemption to vaccination. The
1998 provisional total of 134 cases is the lowest annual
total ever reported.
Since 1994, cases among preschool-aged children have
become less common, and those among school children
have increased. An increased proportion of cases have
occurred among adults. In 1973, persons over 20 years of
age accounted for only about 3% of cases. In 1994, adults
accounted for 24% of cases, and in 1997, this age group
accounted for 32% of all reported cases.
Measles outbreaks
Measles outbreaks are classified into two major types
based on the predominant age group affected. “Preschool”
and “school-aged” outbreaks are those in which children
<5 and persons 5-19 years of age, respectively, account for
the greatest number of cases.
Preschool-type outbreaks involve predominantly
unvaccinated children ‘5 years of age. In contrast,
outbreaks among school-aged children involve highly
vaccinated populations. In some large school-aged
outbreaks, over 95 percent of cases have occurred in
persons with histories of vaccination on or after their first
birthday (i.e., because of vaccine failure).
Measles 1993-1998
• Less than 1000 cases per year
• Many cases due to importation
• Probable elimination in the United
States in 1993
• Elimination in the Americas?

Clinical Case Definition
• Generalized rash lasting >3 days
AND
• Temperature >38.3 C (101 F)
AND
• Cough, or coryza, or conjunctivitis
From 1985 through 1988, the majority of outbreaks occured
in highly vaccinated school-aged populations. An annual
median of 47 school-aged outbreaks occurred, six of which
involved -100 persons. These outbreaks accounted for a
median of 51% of all reported measles cases. Outbreaks
among preschool-aged children accounted for an annual
median of 20% of reported cases during this time.
In 1989-1991, both the number and size of outbreaks
increased, and preschool-type outbreaks became more
prominent. Over 200 outbreaks were reported each year,
several of which included more than 1000 cases each.
These large outbreaks all involved predominately
preschool-aged children. Large preschool outbreaks
occurred in several inner city areas, including Los
Angeles, Houston, Milwaukee, Chicago, Dallas, New York
City, and Philadelphia. In these outbreaks, the majority of
cases occurred among unvaccinated black and Hispanic
children. In 1989-1991, outbreaks among school-aged
children continued to occur, but accounted for a relatively
small proportion of cases.
Since 1993, the largest outbreaks of measles have occurred
in populations that refuse vaccination, including
communities in Utah and Nevada, and Christian Scientist
schools in Missouri and Illinois. Small outbreaks were
reported in unvaccinated preschool populations,
vaccinated school populations, college students, and adult
communities, but these outbreaks were much smaller than
those reported during 1989-1991. No large preschool-type
outbreak has been reported since 1992.
Classification of Measles Cases
Clinical classification of measles cases
A suspect case is any rash illness with fever.
A probable case meets the measles case definition of
generalized maculopapular rash lasting 3 days, with fever
>38.3°C (101°F); and cough, or coryza, or conjunctivitis and
has no or noncontributory serologic or virologic testing.
A confirmed case meets the case definition, and is
epidemiologically linked to another confirmed or probable
case; or is laboratory confirmed.



















## p. 145 (#157) ############################################

/MEASLES
Only confirmed cases should be reported to Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), but confirmed and
probable cases should be reported as soon as possible to
local or state health department.
Epidemiologic classification
An indigenous case is any case that cannot be proved to
be imported (or epidemiologically linked within two
generations to an imported case).
An imported case is a case that has its source outside the
state. To classify a case as imported requires
documentation that the person either had face-to-face
contact with a case of measles outside the state, or was
out-of-state for the entire period when he or she might
have become infected. An international case is classified
as imported from another country if onset of rash is within
18 days of entering the United States.
Measles Vaccine
Measles virus was first isolated by John Enders in 1954.
The first measles vaccines were licensed in 1963. In that
year, both an inactivated (“killed”) and a live attenuated
vaccine (Edmonston B strain) were licensed for use in the
United States. The inactivated vaccine was withdrawn in
1967 because it did not protect against measles virus
infection. Furthermore, recipients of inactivated measles
vaccine frequently developed a unique syndrome, atypical
measles, if infected with wild-type measles virus (see
Atypical Measles, above). The original Edmonston B
vaccine was withdrawn in 1975, because of a relatively
high frequency of fever and rash in recipients. A live,
further attenuated vaccine (Schwarz strain) was first
introduced in 1965, but also is no longer used in the
United States. Another live, further attenuated strain
vaccine (Moraten strain) was licensed in 1968. These
further attenuated vaccines caused fewer reactions than
the original Edmonston B vaccine.
Characteristics
The only measles virus vaccine now available in the
United States is a live, more attenuated Enders-
Edmonston strain (formerly called “Moraten"). The
vaccine is available as a single antigen preparation,
combined with rubella vaccine, or combined with mumps
and rubella vaccines. The ACIP recommends that
combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) be used
when any of the individual components is indicated.

nonresponders
Indications for Measles
(MMR) Vaccine
• All infants 212 months of age
• Susceptible adolescents and
adults without documented
evidence of immunity
Measles Mumps Rubella Vaccine
• 12 months is the recommended
and minimum age for MMR
• MMR given before 12 months
should not be counted as a valid
dose
Measles vaccine is prepared in chick embryo fibroblast
tissue culture. MMR is supplied as a lyophylized (freeze-
dried) powder and is reconstituted with sterile,
preservative-free water. The vaccine contains a small
about of human albumin, neomycin, sorbitol, and gelatin.
Immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy
Measles vaccine produces an inapparent or mild,
noncommunicable infection. Measles antibodies develop in
approximately 95% of children vaccinated at 12 months of
age and 98% of children vaccinated at 15 months of age.
Approximately 2%-5% of children who receive only one dose
of MMR vaccine fail to respond to it (i.e., primary vaccine
failure). MMR vaccine failure may occur because of passive
antibody in the vaccine recipient, damaged vaccine,
incorrect records, and possibly other reasons. Most
children who fail to respond to the first dose will respond to
a second dose. Studies indicate that more than 99% of
persons who receive two doses of measles vaccine (with the
first dose administered no earlier than the first birthday)
develop serologic evidence of measles immunity.
Although the titer of vaccine-induced antibodies is lower
than that following natural disease, both serologic and
epidemiologic evidence indicate that vaccine-induced
immunity appears to be long-term and probably life-long in
most individuals. Most vaccinated persons who appear to
lose antibody show an anamnestic immune response upon
revaccination indicating that they are probably still
immune. Although revaccination can increase antibody
titer in some persons, available data indicate that the
increased titer may not be sustained. Some studies
indicate that secondary vaccine failure (waning immunity)
may occur after successful vaccination, but this appears to
occur very rarely and to only play a minor role in measles
transmission and outbreaks.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Two doses of measles vaccine, as combination MMR,
separated by at least 4 weeks, are routinely recommended
for all children. All persons born in or after 1957 should
have documentation of at least one dose of MMR or other
evidence of measles immunity (see below). Certain
adolescents and adults should receive 2 doses of MMR.
The first dose of MMR should be given on or after the
first birthday. Any dose of measles-containing vaccine
given before 12 months of age should not be counted as
part of the series. Children vaccinated with measles-
containing vaccine before 12 months of age - even one day
early - should be revaccinated with two doses of MMR
vaccine, the first of which should be administered when
the child is at least 12 months of age.


## p. 147 (#159) ############################################

/MEASLES
A second dose of MMR is recommended to produce
immunity in those who failed to respond to the first dose.
The second dose of MMR vaccine should routinely be given
at age 4-6 years, before a child enters kindergarten or first
grade. The preadolescent health visit at age 11-12 years
can serve as a catch-up opportunity to verify vaccination
status and administer MMR vaccine to those children who
have not yet received two doses of MMR.
The second dose of MMR may be administered as soon as
one month (i.e., minimum of 28 days) after the first dose.
Children who have already received two doses of MMR
vaccine at least 1 month apart, with the first dose
administered no earlier than the first birthday, do not
need an additional dose when they enter school. Children
without documentation of adequate vaccination against
measles, rubella, and mumps or other acceptable evidence
of immunity to these diseases when they enter school
should be admitted after receipt of the first dose of MMR.
A second dose should be administered as soon as possible,
but no less than 1 month after the first dose.
Vaccination of adults
Adults born in 1957 or later who do not have a medical
contraindication should receive at least one dose of MMR
vaccine unless they have documentation of vaccination
with at least one dose of measles-, rubella-, and mumps-
containing vaccine or other acceptable evidence of
immunity to these three diseases. With the exception of
women who might become pregnant (see rubella, Chapter
12) and persons who work in medical facilities, birth
before 1957 generally can be considered acceptable
evidence of immunity to measles, rubella, and mumps.
Although not specifically recommended for most persons
born before 1957, such adults, including those who may be
at increased risk of acquiring severe measles, can receive
two doses of MMR provided they are administered no less
than 1 month (i.e. minimum of 28 days) apart and are not
otherwise contraindicated.
Certain groups of adults may be at increased risk for
exposure to measles and should receive special
consideration for vaccination. These persons include
persons attending colleges and other post-high school
educational institutions, persons working in medical
facilities, and international travelers.
Colleges and other post-high school educational
institutions are potential high-risk areas for measles, rubella,
and mumps transmission because of large concentrations of
susceptible persons. Prematriculation vaccination

All persons who work in
medical facilities should be
immune to measles
requirements for measles immunity have been shown to
significantly decrease the risk of measles outbreaks on college
campuses where they are implemented and enforced.
Colleges, universities, technical and vocational schools,
and other institutions for post-high school education
should require documentation of two doses of MMR
vaccine or other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and
mumps immunity before entry.
Students who have no documentation of live measles, rubella,
or mumps vaccination or other acceptable evidence of
measles, rubella, and mumps immunity at the time of
enrollment should be admitted to classes only after receiving
the first dose of MMR. A second dose of MMR should be
administered no less than 1 month (i.e., minimum of 28 days)
later. Students with evidence of prior receipt of only one dose
of MMR or other measles-containing vaccine on or after their
first birthday should receive a second dose of MMR, provided
at least one month has elapsed since their previous dose.
Persons who work in medical facilities are at higher risk
for acquiring measles than the general population. Between
1985 and 1991, at least 795 measles cases occurred in adult
health care workers, including nurses, physicians, laboratory
and radiology technicians, clerks, assistants and students.
An overall decline in measles incidence occurred after the
1989-91 measles resurgence with a total of 36 cases during
1993-96 occurring among persons working in medical
facilities. However, transmission in a medical facility
occurred in 15 of the 75 measles outbreaks reported during
1993-1996.
All persons who work within medical facilities should
have evidence of immunity to measles and rubella.
Because any health care worker (i.e., medical or non-
medical, paid or volunteer, full time or part time, student
or non-student, with or without patient-care
responsibilities) who is measles or rubella susceptible can
contract and transmit these diseases, all medical facilities
(i.e., inpatient and outpatient, private and public) should
ensure measles and rubella immunity among those who
work within their facilities (a possible exception might be
a facility that treats only elderly patients considered at
low risk for measles and rubella and their complications).
Adequate vaccination for measles and rubella for health
care workers born during or after 1957 consists of two
doses of a live measles-containing vaccine and at least one
dose of a live rubella-containing vaccine. Health care
workers needing a second dose of measles-containing
vaccine should be revaccinated at least one month (i.e.,
minimum of 28 days) after their first dose.

/MEASLES
Although birth before 1957 is generally considered
acceptable evidence of measles and rubella immunity,
medical facilities should consider recommending a dose of
MMR vaccine to unvaccinated workers born before 1957
who do not have a history of prior measles disease or
laboratory evidence of measles immunity, and those
without laboratory evidence of rubella immunity.
Serologic screening need not be done before vaccinating
for measles and rubella unless the medical facility
considers it cost-effective. Serologic testing is
appropriate only if tracking systems are used to ensure
that tested persons who are identified as susceptible are
subsequently vaccinated in a timely manner. Serologic
testing for immunity to measles and rubella is not
necessary for persons documented to be appropriately
vaccinated or who have other acceptable evidence of
immunity. If the return and timely vaccination of those
screened cannot be assured, serologic testing before
vaccination should not be done.
Persons who travel outside of the United States are at
increased risk of exposure to measles. Measles is endemic
or epidemic in many countries throughout the world.
Although proof of immunization is not required for entry
into the United States, persons traveling or living abroad
should have evidence of measles immunity. Adequate
vaccination of persons who travel outside the United
States is two doses of MMR.
Revaccination is recommended for certain persons. The
following groups of persons should be considered
unvaccinated and should receive at least one dose of
measles vaccine. Those (1) vaccinated before the first
birthday, (2) vaccinated with killed measles vaccine
(KMV), (3) vaccinated with KMV followed by live vaccine
less than 4 months after the last dose of KMV, (4)
vaccinated prior to 1968 with an unknown type of vaccine
(the vaccine may have been KMV), (5) or vaccinated with
IG in addition to a further attenuated strain or vaccine of
unknown type (revaccination not necessary if IG was
given with Edmonston B vaccine).
Post-exposure prophylaxis
Live measles vaccine provides permanent protection and
may prevent disease if given within 72 hours of exposure.
Measles Vaccine
Indications for Revaccination
• Vaccinated before the first birthday
• Vaccinated with killed measles vaccine (KMV)
• Vaccinated with KMV followed by live vaccine
within 3 months
• Vaccinated prior to 1968 with an unknown
type of vaccine
• Vaccinated with IG in addition to a further
attenuated strain or vaccine of unknown type

Immune globulin (IG) may prevent or modify disease
and provide temporary protection if given within 6 days of
exposure. The dose is 0.25 ml/kg body weight, with a
maximum of 15 ml intramuscularly. The recommended
dose of IG for immunocompromised persons is 0.5ml/kg of
body weight (maximum 15 ml) intramuscularly. IG may be
especially indicated for susceptible household contacts of
measles patients, particularly contacts ~1 year of age (for
whom the risk of complications is highest). If the child is
then 12 months of age or older, live measles vaccine
should be given about 5 months later when the passive
measles antibodies have disappeared. IG should not be
used to control measles outbreaks.
Measles immunity
Persons generally can be considered immune to measles if
they 1) were born before 1957, 2) have documentation of
physician-diagnosed measles, 3) have laboratory evidence of
immunity to measles, or 4) have documentation of adequate
vaccination. Criteria for adequate vaccination currently
Measles Immunity vary depending on state and local vaccination policy. In
• Born before 1957 general, adequate vaccination for preschool-aged children

vaccine
Persons working in medical settings are at higher risk of
measles than the general population. As a result,
adequate vaccination for persons born during or after 1957
who work in medical facilities consists of 2 doses of MMR
or other live measles-containing vaccine separated by at
least one month (i.e. minimum of 28 days) with the first
dose administered no earlier than the first birthday.
Although birth before 1957 is generally considered
acceptable evidence of measles immunity, measles has
occurred in some unvaccinated persons born before 1957.
Medical facilities should consider recommending a dose of
MMR for unvaccinated workers born before 1957 who lack
a history of measles disease or laboratory evidence of
measles immunity.
Only doses of vaccine with written documentation of the
date of receipt should be accepted as valid. Self-reported
doses or a parental history of vaccination, by itself, is not
considered adequate documentation. A health care worker
should not provide an immunization record for a patient
unless that health care worker has administered the vaccine
or has seen a record that documents vaccination. Persons
who lack adequate documentation of vaccination or other
acceptable evidence of immunity should be vaccinated.
Vaccination status and receipt of all vaccinations should be
documented in the patient's permanent medical record.

/MEASLES
Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
Adverse reactions following measles vaccine (except
allergic reactions) represent replication of measles
vaccine virus with subsequent mild illness. These events
occur 5-12 days postvaccination and only occur in persons
who are suseptible to infection. There is no evidence of
increased risk of adverse reactions following MMR
vaccination in persons who are already immune to the
diseases.
Fever is the most common adverse reaction following
MMR vaccination. Although measles, rubella, and mumps
vaccines may cause fever after vaccination, the measles
component of MMR vaccine is most often associated with
this adverse event. After MMR vaccination, 5%-15% of
susceptible persons develop a temperature of >103°F
(>39.4°C) usually occurring 7-12 days after vaccination and
generally lasting 1-2 days. Most persons with fever are
otherwise asymptomatic.
Measles- and rubella-containing vaccines, including MMR,
may cause a transient rash. Rashes, usually appearing 7-
10 days after MMR or measles vaccination, have been
reported in approximately 5% of vaccinees.
MMR vaccine may rarely cause thrombocytopenia (low
platelet count) within the 2 months after vaccination.
Estimates of the frequency of clinically apparent
thrombocytopenia from Europe are 1 case per 30,000 to
40,000 vaccinated susceptible persons, with a temporal
clustering of cases occurring 2 to 3 weeks after vaccination.
The clinical course of these cases was usually transient and
benign, although hemorrhage occurred rarely. The risk for
thrombocytopenia during rubella or measles infection is
much greater than the risk after vaccination. Based on case
reports, the risk for MMR-associated thrombocytopenia
may be higher for persons who have previously had immune
thrombocytopenic purpura, particularly for those who had
thrombocytopenic purpura after an earlier dose of MMR
vaccine.
Transient lymphadenopathy sometimes occurs following
receipt of MMR or other rubella-containing vaccine and
parotitis has been reported rarely following receipt of
MMR or other mumps-containing vaccine.
Arthralgias and other joint symptoms are reported in up
to 25% of susceptible adult women given MMR vaccine.
This adverse event is associated with the rubella
component (see Rubella, Chapter 12, for more details).

MMR Vaccine
Contraindications and Precautions
• Severe allergic reaction to prior
dose or vaccine component
• Pregnancy
• Immunosuppression
• Moderate or severe acute illness
• Recent blood product
Measles and Mumps Vaccines
and Egg Allergy
• Measles and mumps viruses grown
in chick embryo fibroblast culture
• Studies have demonstrated safety
of MMR in egg allergic children
• Vaccinate without testing
Allergic reactions following the administration of MMR
or any of its component vaccines are rare. Most of these
reactions are minor and consist of a wheal and flare or
urticaria at the injection site. Immediate, anaphylactic
reactions to MMR or its component vaccines are extremely
rare. Allergic reactions including rash, pruritus, and
purpura have been temporally associated with mumps
vaccination, but are uncommon and usually mild and of
brief duration.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Persons with severe allergy (i.e., hives, swelling of the
mouth or throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, and
shock) to gelatin or neomycin, or who have had a severe
allergic reaction to a prior dose of MMR, should not be
vaccinated with MMR except with extreme caution.
In the past, persons with a history of anaphylactic
reactions following egg ingestion were considered to be at
increased risk of serious reactions after receipt of
measles- or mumps-containing vaccines, which are
produced in chick embryo fibroblasts. However, recent
data suggest that anaphylactic reactions to measles- and
mumps-containing vaccines are not associated with
hypersensitivity to egg antigens, but to other components
of the vaccines (such as gelatin). The risk for serious
allergic reactions following receipt of these vaccines by
egg-allergic persons is extremely low and skin-testing
with vaccine is not predictive of allergic reaction to
vaccination. Therfore, MMR may be administered to egg-
allergic children without prior routine skin testing or the
use of special protocols.
MMR vaccine does not contain penicillin. A history of
penicillin allergy is not a contraindication to vaccination
with MMR or any other U.S. vaccine.
Women known to be pregnant should not receive
measles vaccine. Pregnancy should be avoided for 1
month following receipt of measles vaccine and 3 months
following MMR vaccine. Close contact with pregnant
women is NOT a contraindication to MMR vaccination of
the contact. Breastfeeding is NOT a contraindication to
vaccination of either the woman or the breastfeeding
child.
Replication of vaccine viruses can be prolonged in persons
who are immunosuppressed or immunodeficient.
Severe immunosuppression can be due to a variety of
conditions, including congenital immunodeficiency, HIV

infection, leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, or
therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation,
or large doses of corticosteroids. Evidence based on case
reports has linked measles vaccine virus infection to
subsequent death in six severely immunocompromised
persons. For this reason, patients who are severely
immunocompromised for any reason should not be
given MMR vaccine. Healthy susceptible close contacts
of severely immunocompromised persons may be
vaccinated.
In general, persons receiving large daily doses of
corticosteroids (>2 mg/kg per day or >20 mg per day of
prednisone) for 14 days or more should not receive MMR
vaccine because of concern about vaccine safety. MMR and
its component vaccines should be avoided for at least one
month after cessation of high dose therapy.
Persons receiving low dose or short course (<14 days)
therapy, alternate-day treatment, maintenance physiologic
doses, or topical, aerosol, intra-articular, bursal, or tendon
injections may be vaccinated. Although persons receiving
high doses of systemic corticosteroids daily or on
alternate days during an interval of less than 14 days
generally can receive MMR or its component vaccines
immediately after cessation of treatment, some experts
prefer waiting until two weeks after completion of
therapy.
Patients with leukemia in remission who have not
received chemotherapy for at least 3 months may receive
MMR or its component vaccines.
Measles disease may be severe in persons with HIV
infection. Available data indicate that vaccination with
MMR has not been associated with severe or unusual
adverse events in HIV-infected persons without evidence
of severe immunosuppression, although antibody
responses have been variable. MMR vaccine is
recommended for all asymptomatic HIV-infected persons,
and should be considered for symptomatic persons who
are not severely immunosuppressed. Asymptomatic
children do not need to be evaluated and tested for HIV
infection before MMR or other measles-containing
vaccines are administered. A theoretical risk of an
increase (probably transient) in HIV viral load following
MMR vaccination exists because such an effect has been
observed with other vaccines. The clinical significance of
such an increase is not known.
MMR and other measles-containing vaccines are not
recommended for HIV-infected persons with
evidence of severe immunosuppression (see table),
primarily because of the report of a case of measles

Persons with moderate to severe acute illness should
not be vaccinated until the illness has resolved. This
precaution is intended to prevent complicating the
management of an ill patient with a potential vaccine
adverse event, such as fever. Minor illness (e.g., otitis
media, mild upper respiratory infections), concurrent
antibiotic therapy, and exposure or recovery from other
illness are not contraindications to measles vaccination.
One recent study suggested that seroconversion to
measles vaccine was reduced in children with upper
respiratory infections. However, multiple previous and
subsequent studies have not confirmed this finding.
Receipt of antibody-containing blood products (e.g.,
immune globulin, whole blood or packed red blood cells,
intravenous immune globulin) may interfere with
seroconversion to measles vaccine. The length of time
that such passively acquired antibody persists depends on
the concentration and quantity of blood product received.
For instance, vaccination is recommended to be delayed
for 3 months following receipt of immune globulin for
prophylaxis of hepatitis A, but a 7-11 month delay is
recommended following administration of intravenous
immune globulin, depending on the dose. For more
information, see Chapter 2 of this book and Table 8 of the
ACIP General Recommendations on Immunization (which
is included in Appendix A of this book).
Persons who have a history of thrombocytopenic purpura
or thrombocytopenia may be at increased risk for
developing clinically significant thrombocytopenia after
MMR vaccination. No deaths have been reported as a
direct consequence of vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia.
The decision to vaccinate with MMR depends on the
benefits of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella and
the risks for recurrence or exacerbation of
thrombocytopenia after vaccination or during natural
infection with measles or rubella. The benefits of
immunization are usually greater than the potential risks,
and administration of MMR vaccine is justified, because of
the even greater risk for thrombocytopenia after measles

or rubella disease. However, deferring a subsequent dose
of MMR vaccine may be prudent if the previous episode of
thrombocytopenia occurred within 6 weeks after the
previous dose of the vaccine. Serologic evidence of
measles immunity in such persons may be sought in lieu of
MMR vaccination.
Tuberculin testing (PPD) is not a prerequisite for
vaccination with MMR or other measles-containing
vaccine. PPD testing has no effect on the response to
MMR vaccination. However, measles vaccine (and
possibly mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines) may
suppress the response to PPD in a person infected with
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To minimize the risk of a PPD and Measles Vaccine
false-negative interpretation, PPD testing should be • Apply PPD first - give MMR
delayed for 4-6 weeks after MMR vaccination. If PPD when skin test read
testing is needed, it should be done prior to MMR
vaccination. It is also acceptable to apply the PPD and • Apply PPD at same time as

Vaccine Storage and Handling
Measles vaccine and MMR must be shipped with
refrigerant to maintain 10°C (50°F) or less at all times.
Vaccine must be refrigerated immediately on arrival and
protected from light at all times. The vaccine must be
stored at refrigerator temperature (2°-8°C (35°-46°F]), but

MEASLES VIRUS ISOLATION
I. Background
The availability of a sensitive cell line (B95a) for isolation of measles virus from clinical specimens and the
establishment of automated DNA sequencing techniques have allowed for rapid genetic characterization of a large
number of wild-type strains of measles virus. This database of sequence information now makes it possible to use
molecular epidemiological techniques to identify the source of wild-type viruses and to rapidly differentiate between
wild-type and vaccine strains. As we progress toward elimination of measles in the U.S., it will be critical to examine
virus isolates from as many outbreaks as possible in order to identify the source of the virus.
Virus isolation and genetic characterization can take several months to complete. Therefore, diagnosis of
measles should always be based on detection of measles-specific IgM in serum. The IgM-capture EIA test
can be completed in one day. Specimens for virus isolation can and should be taken at the same time that serum
is obtained, since a delay in collection will reduce the chance of isolating the virus. However, urine or nasopharyn-
geal or throat swab specimens should not be substituted for serum specimens for measles diagnosis.
We are currently testing the possibility of using saliva in addition to serum to diagnose measles using the
IgM-capture EIA. During a measles outbreak, if you believe that you can collect saliva in addition to serum to help
us to test this method, please contact us and we will send you saliva collection kits. After collection, we would
request that you can send us an aliquot of serum with the saliva.
ll. Protocols
Specimens should be obtained as soon as possible after the onset of rash. Always collecta urine specimen
and, if possible, attempt to collecta respiratory specimen. Protocols are described below.
A. Respiratory Specimens:
Materials.
1. Sterile Swabs
2. sterile Saline
3.3 ml aliquots of viral transport medium (VTM: sterile PBS or suitable isotonic solution such as Hank's BSS, etc.
containing antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin) and either 2% fetal bovine serum or 0.5%
gelatin in 15 ml polycarbonate or polystyrene centrifuge tubes
4.5 ml plastic syringes
5. plastic aspirators or 30 ml syringe
6. Styrofoam shipping containers
Instructions:
1. Attempt to obtain the sample as soon as possible after onset of rash but a maximum of 7 days after rash onset.
2. The preferred specimen is a nasal wash (nasopharyngeal aspirate) using a syringe attached to a small, plastic
tube and 3-5 ml of VTM. After placing VTM in the nose, aspirate as much of the material as possible and rinse the
tube with a small volume (2 ml) of VTM.
3. Alternatively, sterile swabs can be used to wipe the nose and throat. Place both swabs in a tube containing 2-3 ml
of transport medium. The virus is extremely cell-associated, so attempt to swab the throat and nasal passages to
Collect epithelial cells.

4. Keep all specimens on wet ice or at 4°C and ship as soon as possible on wet ice (see address below).
If immediate, cold shipment (within 48 hr.) cannot be arranged or is not convenient, nasal wash specimens
can be centrifuged at 2500 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C and the pellet resuspended in 1 ml of tissue culture medium. If
possible, the supernatant can be saved in a separate tube. The samples should be frozen and shipped at -70° C (dry
ice). If centrifugation is not available, the whole specimen can be frozen (preferably at-70°C) and shipped on dry ice.
Nose and throat swabs can be removed from the transport medium after allowing some time for elution of
virus. The specimen can then be frozen at -70° C and shipped on dry ice.
B. Urine specimens
We prefer urine to be collected in the first week after rash onset, though we will accept urines up to 16 days
after rash onset. Virus has been isolated from the urine for up to one week after the onset of rash. We will also
accept urine from close contacts of measles cases (e.g., household contacts) if they are collected 14 days after the
rash onset of the measles case. First morning voided specimens are ideal, but any urine collection is adequate.
Collect up to 50-100 ml of urine in a 50 ml centrifuge tube or a urine specimen container. Centrifuge at 2500 x g for
15 minutes at 4°C to pellet the sediment. Resuspend the sediment in 2-3 ml of VTM (above) or any cell culture
medium (DMEM, EMEM, RPMI plus antibiotics) and ship. Preferably specimens that have been centrifuged and
resuspended should be frozen at-70°C and shipped on dry ice. If dry ice is not available, however, they can be
stored at 4°C and shipped on wet ice.
If centrifugation is not available, do not freeze the urine sample. The entire urine specimen should be stored
at 4°C, and shipped to the lab on wet ice.
C. Virus isolation:
The marmoset lymphocyte cell line B95a is Epstein-Barr virus transformed and should be handled as an
infectious cell line capable of yielding Epstein-Barr virus (Kobune et al., 1990, JVirol. 64:700-705). This cell line is
useful in measles virus isolation with syncytial and giant-cell cytopathogenic effect (CPE) sometimes visible as early
as 48 hours after inoculation. Isolation-attempt cultures should be followed for 7-8 days with subsequent passages 2-
3 times before ruling out possible isolation of measles virus. B95-8 cells are available from the American Type
Culture Collection (#CRL 1612). When cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM), these
cells will adhere to the surface of the culture vessel and the adherent cells are referred to as B95a.
The cells grow gently attached to the culture surface when grown in DMEM supplemented with 100 units/ml
penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 ug/ml amphotericin (fungizone), and fetal bovine serum. Cell growth is
sustained by adding 5-10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). FBS is used at a 2% concentration for cell maintenance
during viral isolation.
The B95a cells can be passaged by briefly treating the cell monolayers with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to release
cells from tissue culture surface. Be careful not to over trypsinize. Neutralize trypsin by adding DMEM containing
FBS. Usually the cells from a single monolayer culture can be split 1:3. One will notice that more cells tend to
become "floaters", growing in clumps suspended in the medium as the cell density increases. These cells are viable
and can be passaged by gently pipetting to break up the clumps then replating to a lower cell density.
Cells can be transported in a T-75 or T-25 tissue culture flask with additional medium added to help keep
cells attached. Upon its arrival look at the cell sheet. If many cells are free-floating, a light spin of the medium will
recover cells which can be added back to the flask (or to another flask for passage). Add 30-35 mls of the medium
back to the flask for maintenance. Grow cells in a moist CO, incubator at 37°C. Cell stocks can be frozen using
standard cryoprotection medium (20% FBS, 10% DMSO).

Inoculation.
1. Passage cells, split into T-25 flasks @ 1:3 or 1:4 and incubate 24–48 hours.
2. Decant medium, add 1-1.5 ml DMEM w/2X antibiotics, add 0.1 to 1.0 ml of clinical specimen depending on
concentration.
3. Incubate at 37 C. for 1 hour.
4. Decant medium into bleach water, replace medium with DMEM containing 2% FBS and 2X antibiotics.
5. Change medium every 3–4 days and passage cells by splitting (@ 1:3 every 7-9 days. Check for CPE daily.
6. Attempt at least three passages before discontinuing isolation protocol. Do not discard remaining clinical speci-
mens as they may still be used for PCR analysis.
7. If CPE is visible, continue to feed the cells until the CPE becomes extensive. It may be necessary to passage the
cells one time to allow the CPE to progress. When CPE is maximal, pellet cells and freeze at -70 C.
If successful virus isolation has been performed confirmation can be achieved by using an immunological assay
such as fluorescent antibody or by PCR. Please remember to save some of the original clinical specimen. This
material can be used for a second isolation attempt if problems occur with the first as well as provide a specimen for
PCR analysis.
For shipping, it is best to send a plastic 25 cm tissue culture vessel. Cells should be seeded and infected
just prior to shipping. Once cells have been infected, fill the vessel to the top with tissue culture medium (plus
antibiotics and 2% FBS). Screw the top on tightly and seal with Parafilm. It is best to place the vessel in a leak-proof
container such as a ziplock plastic bag and ship at room temperature.
Alternatively, infected cells can be pelleted, resuspended in a small volume of medium, and frozen at-70°C
before shipping on dry ice.
D. Shipping:
Viral isolates (not clinical specimens) arriving from overseas will require CDC and USDA Import Permits.
Please call numbers below to obtain a permit.
If Federal Express is available, contact the CDC to arrange pre-paid transport. If not, CDC will be able to re-
imburse for shipping costs.

Mumps
UMPS IS AN ACUTE VIRAL ILLNESS. ALTHOUGH THE PAROTITIS
and orchitis were described by Hippocrates in
the 5th century B.C., until relatively recently
mumps was viewed primarily as an illness that affected
armies during times of mobilization.
In 1934, Johnson and Goodpasture showed that mumps
could be transmitted from infected patients to rhesus
monkeys and demonstrated that mumps was caused by a
filtrable agent present in saliva. This agent was later
shown to be a virus.
Mumps Virus
Mumps virus is a paramyxovirus in the same group as
parainfluenza and Newcastle disease virus. Parainfluenza
and Newcastle disease viruses produce antibodies that
cross-react with mumps virus. The virus has a single-
stranded RNA genome.
The virus can be isolated or propagated in cultures of
various human and monkey tissues and in embryonated
eggs. It has been recovered from the saliva, cerebrospinal
fluid, urine, blood, milk, and infected tissues of patients
with mumps. The virus causes generalized disease.
Mumps virus is rapidly inactivated by heat, formalin,
ether, chloroform, and ultraviolet light.

Orchitis 20%-50% in postpubertal
males
Pancreatitis 2%-5%
Deafness 1120,000
Death
1-3/10,000
Pathogenesis
The virus is acquired by respiratory droplets. The virus
replicates in the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes.
After 12-25 days a viremia occurs which lasts from 3 to
5 days. During the viremia, the virus spreads to multiple
tissues, including the meninges, and glands such as the
salivary, pancreas, testes, and ovaries. Inflammation in
infected tissues leads to characteristic symptoms of
parotitis and aseptic meningitis.
Clinical Features
The incubation period of mumps is 14-18 days (range,
14-25 days).
The prodromal symptoms are nonspecific, and include
myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-grade fever.
Parotitis is the most common manifestation, and occurs in
30%-40% of infected persons. Parotitis may be unilateral
or bilateral and any combination of single or multiple
salivary glands may be affected. Parotitis tends to occur
within the first 2 days and may first be noted as earache
and tenderness on palpation of the angle of the jaw.
Symptoms tend to decrease after 1 week and are usually
gone by 10 days.
Up to 20% of mumps infections are asymptomatic. An
additional 40%-50% may have only nonspecific or
primarily respiratory symptoms.
Complications
Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in the
form of aseptic meningitis is common, occurring
asymptomatically (inflammatory cells in cerebrospinal
fluid) in 50%-60% of patients. Symptomatic meningitis
(headache, stiff neck) occurs in up to 15% of patients and
resolves without sequelae in 3-10 days. Adults are at
higher risk for this complication than children, and boys
are more commonly affected than girls (3:1 ratio).
Parotitis may be absent in up to 50% of such patients.
Encephalitis is rare (less than 2 per 100,000).












## p. 163 (#175) ############################################

/MUMPS
Orchitis (testicular inflammation) is the most common
complication in postpubertal males. It occurs in up to 20%-
50% of postpubertal males, usually after parotitis, but may
precede it, begin simultaneously, or occur alone. It is
bilateral in up to 30% of affected males. There is usually
abrupt onset of testicular swelling, tenderness, nausea,
vomiting, and fever. Pain and swelling may subside in 1
week, but tenderness may last for weeks. Approximately
50% of patients with orchitis have some degree of
testicular atrophy, but sterility is rare.
Oophoritis (ovarian inflammation) occurs in 5% of
postpubertal females. It may mimic appendicitis. There
is no relationship to impaired fertility.
Pancreatitis is infrequent, but occasionally occurs
without parotitis; the hyperglycemia is transient and is
reversible. While some single instances of diabetes
mellitus have been reported, a causal relationship has yet
to be conclusively demonstrated; many cases of temporal
association have been described both in siblings and
individuals, and outbreaks of diabetes have been reported
a few months or years after outbreaks of mumps.
Deafness caused by mumps is one of the leading causes of
acquired sensorineural deafness in childhood. The
estimated incidence is approximately 1 per 20,000
reported cases of mumps. Hearing loss is unilateral in
approximately 80% of cases and may be associated with
vestibular reactions. Onset is usually sudden and results
in permanent hearing impairment.
Electrocardiogram (EKG) changes compatible with
myocarditis are seen in 3%-15% of patients with mumps,
but symptomatic involvement is rare. Complete recovery
is the rule, but deaths have been reported.
Other less common complications of mumps include
arthralgia, arthritis, and nephritis. Death from mumps
has been reported in 1-3 cases per 10,000 in recent years.
Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of mumps is usually suspected based on
clinical manifestations, in particular the presence of
parotitis.
Mumps virus can be isolated from clinical specimens,
including saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. If virus
isolation is attempted, the specimen should be collected
within the first 5 days of illness.

/MUMPS
Serology is the most common method used to diagnose
mumps. Complement fixation (CF) and hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) antibody tests for mumps are relatively
insensitive, and results may not be reliable. Tests that
have demonstrated reliability include neutralization,
enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and radial hemolysis antibody
tests. Neutralization assays are time consuming and not
generally available for routine diagnostic use.
The EIA is widely available commercially and is more
sensitive than the CF, HI, or radial hemolysis. It is
available for both IgM and IgG. IgM antibodies usually
become detectable during the first few days of illness and
reach a peak about a week after onset. IgG testing usually
requires two specimens separated by several weeks. The
convalescent (second) specimen should show a significant
increase in antibody compared with the acute (first)
specimen.

• Temporal pattern Peak in late winter and spring
Reservoir
• Communicability Three days before to four days
after onset of active disease Mumps is a human disease. While persons with
asymptomatic or nonclassical infection can transmit the
virus, no carrier state is known to exist.
Transmission
Transmission of mumps occurs through airborne
transmission or direct contact with infected droplet nuclei
or saliva.
Temporal pattern
Mumps incidence peaks predominantly in winter-spring,
but the disease is endemic year-round.
Communicability
Contagiousness is similar to that of influenza and rubella,
but less than that for measles or chickenpox. The
infectious period is considered to be from 3 days before to
the 4th day of active disease; virus has been isolated from
saliva 7 days before to 9 days after onset of parotitis.

Secular Trends in the United States
Mumps became a nationally reportable disease in the
United States in 1968. However, an estimated 212,000
cases occurred in the United States in 1964. Following
vaccine licensure, reported mumps decreased rapidly.
Approximately 3,000 cases were reported annually in
1983-1985 (1.3-1.55 cases per 100,000 population).
In 1986 and 1987 there was a relative resurgence of
mumps. The peak was in 1987, when 12,848 cases were
reported. The highest incidence of mumps during the
resurgence was among older school-age and college-age
youth (10-19 years of age) who were born before
recommendations for routine mumps vaccination. Mumps
incidence in this period correlated with absence of
comprehensive state requirements for mumps
immunization. Several mumps outbreaks among highly
vaccinated school populations were reported, indicating
that high coverage with a single dose of mumps vaccine
did not always prevent disease transmission, probably
because of vaccine failure.
Since 1989, there has been a steady decline in reported
mumps cases, from 5,712 cases to a provisional total of
606 cases in 1998, the lowest annual total ever reported.
The decrease in mumps in recent years is most likely the
result of implementation of the second dose
recommendation for measles vaccine (as MMR).
Prior to vaccine licensure in 1967, and during the early
years of vaccine use, most reported cases occurred in the
5-9 year age group; 90% of cases occurred among children
under 15 years of age. In the late 1980s, however, there
was a shift towards older children. Since 1982, 50%-80%
of reported cases have occurred among children 5-19 years
of age. The proportion of cases in infants and adults has
increased since 1990. Males and females are affected
equally.
Eighty percent or more of adults in urban and suburban
areas with or without a history of mumps have serologic
evidence of immunity.

Indications
Mumps Vaccine
Characteristics
Mumps virus was isolated in 1945 and an inactivated
vaccine was developed in 1948. This vaccine produced
only short-lasting immunity, and its use was discontinued
in the mid-1970s. The currently used Jeryl Lynn strain of
live attenuated mumps virus vaccine was licensed in
December 1967.
Immunogenicityand vaccine efficacy
Mumps vaccine is available as a single antigen
preparation, combined with rubella vaccine, or combined
with measles and rubella vaccines. The ACIP recommends
that combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) be
used when any of the individual components is indicated.
Mumps vaccine is prepared in chick embryo fibroblast
tissue culture. MMR is supplied as a lyophylized (freeze-
dried) powder and is reconstituted with sterile,
preservative-free water. The vaccine contains small
amounts of human albunim, neomycin, sorbitol, and
gelatin.
Mumps vaccine produces an inapparent, or mild,
noncommunicable infection. The currently used vaccine
elicits antibody in over 95% of vaccinees. Clinical efficacy
has been estimated to be 95% (range, 90%–97%). The
duration of vaccine-induced immunity is believed to be
greater than 25 years, and is probably life-long in most
vaccine recipients.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Two doses of mumps vaccine, as combination MMR
vaccine, separated by at least 4 weeks, are routinely
recommended for all children. All persons born in or after
1957 should have documentation of at least one dose of
MMR. The first dose of MMR should be given on or after
the first birthday. Any dose of mumps-containing vaccine
given before 12 months of age should not be counted as
part of the series. Children vaccinated with mumps-
containing vaccine before 12 months of age - even one day
early - should be revaccinated with two doses of MMR
vaccine, the first of which should be administered when
the child is at least 12 months of age.









## p. 167 (#179) ############################################

AMUMPS
A second dose of MMR is recommended to produce immunity
in those who failed to respond to the first dose. Data
indicate that almost all of the persons who do not respond to
the measles component of the first dose will respond to a
wated second dose of MMR. Few data on the immune response to
Oduced the rubella and mumps components of a second dose of MMR
conting are available. However, most persons who do not respond to

grade. The adolescent health visit at age 11-12 years can
|| serve as a catch-up opportunity to verify vaccination status
| and administer MMR vaccine to those children who have not

may be administered as soon as one month (i.e., 28 days)
after the first dose.

## p. 168 (#180) ############################################

168 MUMPS
Live mumps vaccine was not used routinely before 1977
and the peak incidence was in 5- to 9-year-olds before the
vaccine was introduced. Most persons born before 1957
are likely to have been infected naturally between 1957
and 1977. As a result, persons born before 1957 generally
may be considered to be immune, even if they did not have
clinically recognizable mumps disease. However, as with
measles and rubella, this 1957 cutoff date for
susceptibility is arbitrary and vaccination with MMR
should be considered during mumps outbreaks for persons
born before 1957 who may be exposed to mumps and may
be nonimmune. Laboratory testing for mumps
susceptibility before vaccination is not necessary.
Post-exposure prophylaxis
Neither mumps immune globulin nor immune globulin
(IG) is effective postexposure prophylaxis. Vaccination
after exposure is not harmful and may possibly avert later
disease.
/ Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
MMR Adverse Reactions
• Fever 5%-15% Mumps is a very safe vaccine. Most adverse events
• Rash 5% reported following MMR vaccine (such as fever, rash, and
joint symptoms) are attributable to the measles or rubella
components.
• Joint symptons 25%
• Thrombocytopenia siſ30,000 doses
• Parotitis rare
• Deafness rare
• Encephalopathy <1/1,000,000 doses
No adverse reactions were reported in large-scale field
trials. Subsequently, parotitis and fever have been
reported rarely. A few cases of orchitis (all suspect) also
have been reported.
Rare cases of CNS dysfunction, including cases of deafness,
within 2 months of mumps vaccination have been reported.
The calculated incidence of CNS reactions is approximately
one per million doses of antigen, a rate lower than the
reported background encephalitis rate of 2-6/10,000. The
Institute of Medicine (1993) concluded that evidence is
inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship between
the Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps vaccine and aseptic
meningitis, encephalitis, sensorineural deafness, or orchitis.
Allergic reactions, including rash, pruritus, and purpura
have been temporally associated with vaccination, but are
transient and generally mild.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Persons with severe allergy (i.e., hives, swelling of the
mouth or throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, and
shock) to gelatin or neomycin, or who had a severe allergic
reaction to a prior dose of MMR, should generally not be
vaccinated with MMR.










## p. 169 (#181) ############################################

/MUMPS
In the past, persons with a history of anaphylactic
reactions following egg ingestion were considered to be at
increased risk of serious reactions after receipt of
measles- or mumps-containing vaccines, which are
produced in chick embryo fibroblasts. However, recent
data suggest that most anaphylactic reactions to measles-
and mumps-containing vaccines are not associated with
hypersensitivity to egg antigens, but to other components
of the vaccines (such as gelatin). The risk for serious
allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis following receipt of
these vaccines by egg-allergic persons is extremely low
and skin-testing with vaccine is not predictive of allergic
reaction to vaccination. As a result, MMR may be
administered to egg-allergic children without prior
routine skin-testing or the use of special protocols.
MMR vaccine does not contain penicillin. A history of
penicillin allergy is not a contraindication to MMR
vaccination.
Pregnant women should not receive mumps vaccine for
theoretic reasons. There is no evidence that mumps
vaccine virus causes fetal damage. Pregnancy should be
avoided for 3 months after vaccination with MMR vaccine.
Persons with immunodeficiency or
immunosuppression resulting from leukemia,
lymphoma, generalized malignancy, immune deficiency
disease, or immunosuppressive therapy should not be
vaccinated. However, treatment with low dose
(<2 mg/kg/day), alternate day, topical, or aerosolized
steroid preparations is not a contraindication to mumps
vaccination. Persons whose immunosuppressive therapy
with steroids has been stopped for 1 month may be
vaccinated.
Persons with moderate or severe acute illness should
not be vaccinated until the illness has resolved. Minor
illness (e.g., otitis media, mild upper respiratory
infections), concurrent antibiotic therapy, and exposure or
recovery from other illnesses, are not contraindications to
mumps vaccination.
Receipt of antibody-containing blood products (e.g.,
immune globulin, whole blood or packed red blood cells,
intravenous immune globulin) may interfere with
Seroconversion following mumps vaccination. Vaccine
should be given 2 weeks before, or deferred for at least 3
months following, administration of an antibody-
Containing blood product (see Chapter 1 for details).
A family history of diabetes is not a contraindication for

Rubello
HE NAME RUBELLA Is DERIVED FROM LATIN, MEANING “little
red.” It was initially considered to be a variant of
measles or scarlet fever and was called “third
disease.” It was not until 1814 that it was first described
as a separate disease in the German medical literature.
Rubella
• From Latin meaning "littlered"
• Discovered in 18th century-thought to be
variant of measles
• First described as distinct clinicalentity in
In 1914, Hess postulated a viral etiology based on his work German literature
with monkeys. Hiro and Tosaka in 1938 confirmed the
viral etiology by passing the disease to children using
filtered nasal washings from acute cases.
• Congenitalrubella syndrome described by
Gregg in 1941
• Pandemic in Europe and U.S. 1962-65
Following a widespread Australian epidemic of rubella
infection in 1940, Gregg, an Australian ophthalmologist,
reported in 1941 the occurrence of congenital cataracts
among 78 infants born following maternal rubella infection
in early pregnancy. This was the first reported recognition
of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
Rubella Virus
Rubella virus was first isolated in 1962 by Parkman and
Rubella Virus
Weller. Rubella virus is classified as a togavirus, genus
Rubivirus. It is most closely related to group A • Togavirus

Hemorrhagic manifestations occur with an approximate
incidence of 1 per 3,000 cases, occurring more often in
children than in adults. These manifestations may be
secondary to low platelets and vascular damage, with
thrombocytopenic purpura being the most common
manifestation. Gastrointestinal, cerebral, or intrarenal
hemorrhage may occur. Effects may last from days to
months, and most patients recover.
Additional complications include orchitis, neuritis, and a
rare late syndrome of progressive panencephalitis.
Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS)
Prevention of CRS is the main objective of rubella
vaccination programs in the United States.
The 1964 rubella epidemic resulted in 12.5 million cases of
rubella infection and about 20,000 newborns with CRS.
The estimated cost of the epidemic was $840 million. This
does not include the emotional toll on the families
involved. The estimated lifetime cost of one case of CRS
today is estimated to be in excess of $200,000.
Rubella can be a disastrous disease in early gestation,
leading to fetal death, premature delivery, and an array of
congenital defects. Spontaneous abortion and stillbirths
are common. The severity of the effects of rubella virus on
the fetus depends largely on the time of gestation at which
infection occurs. Up to 85% of infants infected in the first
trimester of pregnancy will be found to be affected if
followed after birth. While fetal infection may occur
throughout pregnancy, defects are rare when infection
occurs after the 20th week of gestation. The overall risk of
defects during the third trimester is probably no greater
than that associated with uncomplicated pregnancies.
Congenital infection with rubella virus can affect virtually
all organ systems. Deafness is the most common and
often the sole manifestation of congenital rubella
infection, especially after the 4th month of gestation.
Eye defects, including cataracts, glaucoma, retinopathy,
and microphthalmia may occur. Cardiac defects such as
patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect,
pulmonic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta are
possible. Neurologic abnormalities, including
microcephaly and mental retardation, and other
abnormalities, including bone lesions, splenomegaly,
hepatitis, and thrombocytopenia with purpura may occur.
Manifestations of CRS may be delayed from 2 to 4 years.
Diabetes mellitus appearing in later childhood occurs
frequently in children with CRS. In addition, progressive
encephalopathy resembling subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis (SSPE) has been observed in some older
children with CRS.

Rubella
Laboratory Diagnosis
* Isolation of rubella virus from clinical specimen
(e.g., nasopharynx, urine)
• Significant rise in rubella IgG by any standard
serologic assay (e.g., enzyme immunoassay)
• Positive serologic test for rubella IgM antibody
CRS infants may have low hemagglutination inhibution
(HI) titers, but may have high titers of neutralizing
antibody that may persist for years. Reinfection may
occur. Impaired cell-mediated immunity has been
demonstrated in some children with CRS.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Many rash illnesses may mimic rubella infection and up to
50% of rubella infections may be subclinical. The only
reliable evidence of acute rubella infection is the presence
of rubella-specific IgM antibody, demonstration of a
significant rise in IgG antibody from paired acute and
convalescent sera, or a positive viral culture for rubella.
Rubella virus can be isolated from nasal, blood, throat,
urine and cerebrospinal fluid specimens from rubella and
CRS cases. Virus may be isolated from the pharynx 1
week before and until 2 weeks after rash onset. Although
isolation of the virus is diagnostic of rubella infection,
viral cultures are labor intensive and therefore, not done
in many laboratories; they are generally not used for
routine diagnosis of rubella. Viral isolation is an
extremely valuable epidemiologic tool, and should be
attempted for all suspected cases of rubella or CRS. A
state laboratory or CDC should be consulted for details of
viral isolation.
Serology is the most common method of confirming the
diagnosis of rubella. Acute rubella infection can be
serologically confirmed by a significant rise in rubella
antibody titer in acute and convalescent serum specimens
or by the presence of serum rubella IgM. Sera should be
collected as early as possible (within 7–10 days) after
onset of illness, and again 14-21 days (minimum of 7) days
later.
False-positive serum rubella IgM tests have occurred in
persons with parvovirus infections, with a positive
heterophile test for infectious mononucleosis, or with a
positive rheumatoid factor.
The serologic tests available for laboratory confirmation of
rubella infections vary among laboratories. The state
health department can provide guidance on available
laboratory services and preferred tests.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).
ELISA is sensitive, widely available, and relatively easy to
perform. It can also be modified to measure IgM
antibodies. Most of the diagnostic testing done for
rubella antibodies uses some variation of ELISA.






## p. 177 (#189) ############################################

RUBELLA
Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was once the
“standard” and most commonly used technique. It is
sensitive and simple to perform and allows for either
screening or diagnosis (if paired acute and convalescent
sera are tested). A four-fold rise or greater in HI antibody
titer in paired sera is diagnostic of recent infection. The
test may be modified to detect rubella-specific IgM
antibody indicative of primary infection.
Immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) is a rapid
and sensitive assay. Commercial assays for both IgG and
IgM are available in the United States. Care must be
taken with the IgM assay to avoid false-positive results
due to complexes with rheumatoid antibody.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Rubella occurs worldwide.
Mode of transmission
Rubella is spread from person-to-person via airborne
transmission or droplets shed from the respiratory
secretions of infected persons. There is no evidence of
insect transmission.
Rubella may be transmitted by subclinical cases
(approximately 30%-50% of all rubella infections).
Reservoir
Rubella is a human disease. There is no known animal
reservoir. Although infants with CRS may shed rubella
virus for an extended period, a true carrier state has not
been described.
Temporal pattern
In temperate areas, incidence is usually highest in late
winter and early spring.
Communicability
Rubella is only moderately contagious. The disease is most
contagious when the rash is erupting, but virus may be shed
from 7 days before to 5-7 days or more after rash onset.
Infants with CRS shed large quantities of virus from body
Secretions for up to one year and can therefore transmit
rubella to persons caring for them who are susceptible to
the disease.

Secular Trends in the United States
Rubella and congenital rubella syndrome became
nationally notifiable diseases in 1966. The largest annual
total of cases of rubella in the United States was in 1969,
when 57,686 cases were reported (58 cases per 100,000
population).
Following vaccine licensure in 1969, rubella incidence fell
rapidly. By 1983, fewer than 1,000 cases per year were
reported (<0.5 cases per 100,000 population). A moderate
resurgence of rubella occurred in 1990-1991, primarily due
to outbreaks in California (1990) and among the Amish in
Pennsylvania (1991).
Until recently, there was no predominant age group for
rubella cases. From 1982 through 1992, approximately
30% of cases occurred in each of three age groups: <5, 5-19,
and 20-39 years. Adults -40 years of age typically
accounted for <10% of cases. However, since 1994,
persons 20-39 years of age have accounted for more than
half of the cases. In 1997, this age group accounted for
77% of all reported cases. Most persons with rubella in
this age group were born outside the United States, in
areas where rubella vaccine is not routinely given.
In the prevaccine era, epidemics of rubella occurred every
6-9 years, with the last major U.S. epidemic occurring in
1964-1965. No large epidemics have occurred since the
vaccine was licensed for use in 1969. However, outbreaks
continue to occur among groups of susceptible persons
who congregate in locations that increase their exposure,
such as workplaces, and among persons with religious and
philosophic exemption to vaccination. Several recent
outbreaks have occured among predominantly Hispanic
persons. As a result, persons of Hispanic origin accounted
for two thirds of reported cases in 1996.
CRS surveillance is maintained through the National
Congenital Rubella Registry, which is managed by the
National Immunization Program. The largest annual total
of reported CRS cases to the registry was in 1970 (67
cases). An average of 5-6 CRS cases have been reported
annually since 1980.
Although reported rubella activity has consistently and
significantly decreased since vaccine has been used in the
U.S., the incidence of CRS has only paralleled the
decrease in rubella cases since the mid-1970s. The fall in
CRS since the mid-1970's was due to an increased effort to
vaccinate susceptible adolescents and young adults,
especially women.

RUBELLA
Rubella outbreaks are almost always followed by an
increase in CRS. Rubella outbreaks in California and
Pennsylvania in 1990-1991 resulted in 25 cases of CRS in
1990 and 33 cases in 1991. A provisional total of 9 CRS
cases were reported in 1997. The mothers of all these
infants were born outside the United States, primarily in
Latin America and the Caribbean where rubella vaccine is
not routinely used.
Classification of Rubella Cases
Clinical case definition of acquired rubella
A clinical case of rubella is defined as an illness with all of
the following characteristics: (1) acute onset of generalized
maculopapular rash; (2) a temperature >37.2°C (>99% F), if
measured; and (3) arthralgia, arthritis, lymphadenopathy,
or conjunctivitis. Cases meeting the measles case
definition are excluded. Also excluded are cases with
serology compatible with recent measles virus infection.
Case classification of acquired rubella
A suspected case is any generalized rash illness of acute
onset. A probable case meets the clinical case definition,
has noncontributory or no serologic or virologic testing,
and is not epidemiologically linked to a laboratory
confirmed case. A confirmed case is laboratory
confirmed or meets the clinical case definition and is
epidemiologically linked to a laboratory confirmed case.
Clinical case definition of
congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)
The clinical case definition of CRS is an illness, usually
diagnosed in infancy, resulting from rubella infection in
utero and characterized by symptoms from the following
categories:
(A) Cataracts, congenital glaucoma, congenital heart
disease (most commonly patent ductus arteriosus or
peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis), loss of hearing,
pigmentary retinopathy
Associated symptoms may be:
(B) Purpura, splenomegaly, jaundice, microcephaly, mental
retardation, meningoencephalitis, radiolucent bone disease.

Case classification of congenital rubella syndrome
An infection-only case is one with laboratory evidence of
infection, but without any clinical symptoms or signs. A
possible case has some compatible clinical findings, but
does not meeting the criteria for a probable case. A
probable case is is one that is not laboratory confirmed,
has any two complications listed in (A) above or one
complication from (A) and one from (B), and lacks
evidence of any other etiology. A confirmed case is a
clinically compatible case and is laboratory confirmed. In
probable cases, either or both of the eye-related findings
(cataracts and congenital glaucoma) count as a single
complication. In cases classified as infection-only, if any
compatible signs or symptoms (e.g., hearing loss) are
identified later, the case is reclassified as confirmed.
Rubella Vaccine
Three rubella vaccines were licensed in the U.S. in 1969:
HPV-77:DE-5 (duck embryo), HPV-77:DK-12 (dog kidney),
and Cendehill (rabbit kidney) strains. The HPV-77:DK-12
was later removed from the market because there was a
higher rate of joint complaints following vaccination with
this strain. In January 1979, the RA 27/3 (human diploid
fibroblast) strain (Meruvax-II) was licensed and all other
strains were discontinued.
Characteristics
The RA 27/3 rubella vaccine is a live attenuated virus. It
was first isolated in 1965 at the Wistar Institute from a
rubella-infected aborted fetus. The virus was attenuated
by 25-30 passages in tissue culture, using human diploid
fibroblasts. It does not contain duck, chicken or egg
protein.
Vaccine virus is not communicable, except in the setting of
breast-feeding (see below), even though virus may be
cultured from the nasopharynx of vaccinees.
Immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy
Rubella vaccine is available as a single antigen
preparation, combined with mumps vaccine, or combined
with measles and rubella vaccines. The ACIP recommends
that combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) be
used when any of the individual components is indicated.
RA 27/3 rubella vaccine is safe and more immunogenic
than previously used rubella vaccines. In clinical trials,
95% or more of vaccinees aged 12 months and older
developed serologic evidence of rubella immunity after a

RUBELLA 181
single dose. More than 90% of vaccinated persons have
protection against both clinical rubella and viremia for at
least 15 years. Follow-up studies indicate that one dose of
vaccine confers long-term, probably lifelong, protection.
Several reports indicate that viremic reinfection following
exposure may occur among vaccinated persons who have
low levels of detectable antibody. The frequency and
consequences of this phenomenon are unknown, but it is
believed to be uncommon. Rarely, clinical reinfection and
fetal infection have been reported among women with
vaccine-induced immunity. Rare cases of CRS have
occurred among infants born to women who had
documented serologic evidence of rubella immunity before
they became pregnant.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Two doses of rubella vaccine, as combination MMR
vaccine, separated by at least 4 weeks, are routinely
recommended for all children. All persons born in or after
1957 should have documentation of at least one dose of
MMR. The first dose of MMR should be given on or after
the first birthday. Any dose of rubella-containing vaccine
given before 12 months of age should not be counted as
part of the series. Children vaccinated with rubella-
containing vaccine before 12 months of age - even one day
early - should be revaccinated with two doses of MMR
vaccine, the first of which should be administered when
the child is at least 12 months of age.
A second dose of MMR is recommended to produce
immunity in those who failed to respond to the first dose.
Data indicate that almost all of the persons who do not
respond to the measles component of the first dose will
respond to a second dose of MMR. Few data on the
immune response to the rubella and mumps components of
a second dose of MMR are available. However, most
persons who do not respond to the rubella or mumps
component of the first MMR dose would be expected to
respond to the second dose of MMR. The second dose is
not generally considered a booster dose because a primary
immune response to the first dose provides long-term
protection. Although a second dose of vaccine may
increase antibody titers in some persons who responded
to the first dose, available data indicate that these
increased antibody titers were not sustained. The
combined MMR vaccine is recommended for both doses to
assure immunity to all three viruses.
The second dose of MMR vaccine should routinely be given
at age 4-6 years, before a child enters kindergarten or first
grade. The adolescent health visit at age 11-12 years can
Serve as a catch-up opportunity to verify vaccination

status and administer MMR vaccine to those children who
have not yet received two doses of MMR (with the first
dose administered no earlier than the first birthday). The
second dose of MMR may be administered as soon as one
month (i.e., minimum of 28 days) after the first dose.
All older children not previously immunized should
receive one dose of rubella vaccine as MMR.
Adults born in 1957 or later who do not have a medical
contraindication should receive at least one dose of MMR
vaccine unless they have documentation of vaccination with
at least one dose of measles-, rubella-, and mumps-
containing vaccine or other acceptable evidence of
immunity to these three diseases. Some adults at high risk
of measles exposure may require a second dose of measles
vaccine. This second dose should be administered as
combined MMR vaccine (see Measles chapter for details).
Efforts should be made to identify and vaccinate susceptible
adolescents and adults, particularly women of childbearing
age who are not pregnant. Particular emphasis should be
placed on vaccinating both males and females in colleges,
places of employment, and health care settings.
Rubella immunity
Persons generally can be considered immune to rubella if
they have documentation of vaccination with at least one
dose of MMR or other live rubella-containing vaccine
administered on or after their first birthday, have
laboratory evidence of rubella immunity, or were born
before 1957. Persons who have an “equivocal” serologic
test result should be considered rubella-susceptible unless
they have evidence of adequate vaccination or subsequent
serologic testing indicates rubella immunity. Although
only one dose of rubella-containing vaccine is required as
acceptable evidence of immunity to rubella, children
should receive two doses of MMR vaccine according to the
routine childhood vaccination schedule.
Birth before 1957 provides only presumptive evidence of
rubella immunity; it does not guarantee that a person is
immune to rubella. Because rubella can occur in some
unvaccinated persons born before 1957 and because
congenital rubella and congenital rubella syndrome can
occur in the offspring of women infected with rubella
during pregnancy, birth before 1957 is not acceptable
evidence of rubella immunity for women who might
become pregnant.
Clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable and should
not be considered in assessing immune status. Because
many rash illnesses may mimic rubella infection and many
rubella infections are unrecognized, the only reliable



## p. 183 (#195) ############################################

RUBELLA 183
evidence of previous rubella infection is the presence of
serum rubella IgG. Laboratories that regularly perform
antibody testing are generally the most reliable because
their reagents and procedures are strictly standardized.
Occasionally, an individual with a history of documented
rubella vaccination is found to have a negative serum IgG
by ELISA. Such persons may be given a dose of MMR
vaccine and do not need to be retested for serologic
evidence of rubella immunity.
Although birth before 1957 is generally considered
acceptable evidence of measles and rubella immunity,
medical facilities should consider recommending a dose of
MMR vaccine to unvaccinated workers born before 1957
who do not have laboratory evidence of rubella immunity.
Rubella vaccination or laboratory evidence of rubella
immunity is particularly important for health-care
workers who could become pregnant, including those born
before 1957. This recommendation is based on serologic
studies which indicate that among hospital workers born
before 1957, 5–9% had no detectable measles antibody.
Serologic screening need not be done before
vaccinating for measles and rubella unless the medical
facility considers it cost-effective. Serologic testing is
appropriate only if tracking systems are used to ensure
that tested persons who are identified as susceptible are
subsequently vaccinated in a timely manner. If the return
and timely vaccination of those screened cannot be
assured, vaccination should be performed without prior
testing. Serologic testing for immunity to measles and
rubella is not necessary for persons documented to be
appropriately vaccinated or who have other acceptable
evidence of immunity.
Neither rubella vaccine nor immune globulin is effective for
post-exposure prophylaxis of rubella. Vaccination after
exposure is not harmful and may possibly avert later disease.
Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
Rubella is a very safe vaccine. Most adverse events
reported following MMR vaccination are attributable to
the measles component (such as fever and rash). The most
common complaints following rubella vaccination are
fever, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia. These adverse
events only occur in susceptible persons and are more
common in adults, especially in women.
Joint symptoms, such as arthralgia (joint pain) and
arthritis (joint redness and/or swelling), are associated with
the rubella component of MMR. Arthralgia and transient
arthritis occur more frequently in susceptible adults than in
children and more frequently in susceptible women than in

approximately 25% of susceptible postpubertal females
develop acute arthralgia following RA 27/3 vaccination, and
approximately 10% have been reported to have acute
arthritis-like signs and symptoms. Rarely, transient
peripheral neuritic complaints, such as paresthesias and
pain in the arms and legs, have been reported.
When acute joint symptoms occur, or when pain and/or
paresthesias not associated with joints occur, the
symptoms generally begin 1-3 weeks after vaccination,
persist for 1 day to 3 weeks, and rarely recur. Adults with
acute joint symptoms following rubella vaccination rarely
have had to disrupt work activities.
Data from studies in the United States and experience from
other countries using the RA 27/3 strain rubella vaccine
have not supported an association between the vaccine and
chronic arthritis. One study among 958 seronegative
immunized and 932 seronegative unimmunized women
aged 15-39 years found no association between rubella
vaccination and development of recurrent joint symptoms,
neuropathy, or collagen disease.
The ACIP continues to recommend the vaccination of all
adult women who do not have evidence of rubella
immunity.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Persons with severe allergy (i.e., hives, swelling of the
mouth or throat, difficulty breathing, hypotension, shock)
to gelatin or neomycin, or who had a severe allergic
reaction to a prior dose of rubella or MMR vaccine should
generally not be vaccinated with MMR except with
extreme caution.
Women known to be pregnant or attempting to
become pregnant should not receive rubella vaccine.
Although there is no evidence that rubella vaccine virus
causes fetal damage (see below), pregnancy should be
avoided for 3 months after rubella or MMR vaccination.
Persons with immunodeficiency or
immunosuppression, resulting from leukemia,
lymphoma, generalized malignancy, immune deficiency
disease, or immunosuppressive therapy should not be
vaccinated. However, treatment with low dose (<2 mg/kg/
day), alternate day, topical, or aerosolized steroid
preparations is not a contraindication to rubella
vaccination. Persons whose immunosuppressive therapy





## p. 185 (#197) ############################################

with steroids has been stopped for 1 month (3 months for
chemotherapy) may be vaccinated. Rubella vaccine should
be considered for persons with HIV infection.
Persons with moderate to severe acute illness should
not be vaccinated until the illness has resolved. Minor
illness (e.g., otitis media, mild upper respiratory
infections), concurrent antibiotic therapy, and exposure or
recovery from other illness are not contraindications to
rubella vaccination.
Receipt of antibody-containing blood products (e.g.,
immune globulin, whole blood or packed red blood cells,
intravenous immune globulin) may interfere with
seroconversion to rubella vaccine. Vaccine should be
given 2 weeks before, or deferred for at least 3 months
following administration of an antibody-containing blood
product. If rubella vaccine is given as combined MMR, a
longer delay may be necessary before vaccination. For
more information, see the chapter on General
Recommendations on Immunization.
Previous administration of human anti-
Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGam) does not generally
interfere with an immune response to rubella vaccine and
is not a contraindication to postpartum vaccination.
However, women who have received anti-Rho immune
globulin should be serologically tested 6-8 weeks after
vaccination to assure that seroconversion has occurred.
Although vaccine virus may be isolated from the pharynx,
vaccinees do not transmit rubella to others, except
occasionally in the case of the vaccinated breast-feeding
woman. In this situation, the infant may be infected,
presumably through breast milk, and may develop a mild
rash illness, but serious effects have not been reported.
Infants infected through breast-feeding have been shown
to respond normally to rubella vaccination at 12-15 months
of age. Breast-feeding is not a contraindication to rubella
vaccination and does not alter rubella vaccination
recommendations.
Rubella Vaccination of Women of
Childbearing Age
Women who are pregnant or intend to become pregnant
within 3 months, should not receive rubella vaccine. The
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
recommends that vaccine providers ask a woman if she is
pregnant or likely to become pregnant in the next 3
months. Those who are pregnant or intend to become

pregnant should not be vaccinated. All other women
should be vaccinated after being advised of the theoretical
risks of vaccination during pregnancy and the importance
of not becoming pregnant during the 3 months following
vaccination. ACIP does not recommend routine pregnancy
screening of women before rubella vaccination.
If a pregnant woman is inadvertently vaccinated or if she
becomes pregnant within 3 months after vaccination, she
should be counseled about the concern for the fetus (see
below), but MMR vaccination during pregnancy should not
ordinarily be a reason to consider termination of the
pregnancy.
While pregnancy is a contraindication to rubella vaccination,
some women have been inadvertently vaccinated while
pregnant or soon before conception. When rubella vaccine
was licensed, this situation was of concern because of the
known teratogenicity of the wild virus strain. Therefore,
from 1971-1989, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) maintained a registry of women
vaccinated during pregnancy to determine whether CRS
would occur in infants of such mothers.
Subclinical fetal infection has been detected serologically
in approximately 1%-2% of infants born to susceptible
vaccinees, regardless of the vaccine strain. However,
based on data collected by the CDC in the Vaccine in
Pregnancy (VIP) Registry (1971–1989), no evidence of
CRS has occurred in offspring of the 321 susceptible
women who received rubella vaccine and who continued
pregnancy to term. The observed risk of vaccine-induced
malformation is now 0%, with a maximum theoretical risk
of 1.6%, based on 95% confidence limits (1.2% for all types
of rubella vaccine). Since the risk of the vaccine to the
fetus appears to be extremely low, if it exists at all,
routine termination of pregnancy is not recommended.
Individual counseling for these women is recommended.
As of April 30, 1989, CDC discontinued the VIP registry.
Evaluation of the effectiveness of prevaccine pregnancy
prevention counseling in women of childbearing age in
Hawaii revealed that the pregnancy rate for all women
15-44 years old in Hawaii was 122.8/1,000/year and the
pregnancy rate among vaccinees 15-44 years of age who
were counseled was 14.0/1,000/year. Thus, efficacy of
counseling is 88.6% ([122.8-14.0]/[122.8 x 100]).

The ACIP continues to state that pregnant women should
not be vaccinated, because of the small theoretical risk to
the fetus of a vaccinated woman.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine must be shipped
with refrigerant to maintain 10°C (50°F) or less at all
times. Vaccine must be refrigerated immediately on
arrival and protected from light at all times. The vaccine
must be stored at refrigerator temperature (2°-8°C (35°-
46°F]), but may be frozen. Diluent may be stored at
refrigerator temperature or at room temperature.
After reconstitution, MMR vaccines must be stored at
refrigerator temperature and protected from light.
Reconstituted vaccine should be used immediately. If
reconstituted vaccine is not used within 8 hours it must be
discarded.
Strategies to Decrease Rubella and CRS
CRS elimination
Although the CRS case count is low, rubella transmission
continues to occur, and increased in 1989 and 1990. The
elimination of CRS will require several interventions:
—Achievement and maintenance of high immunization levels.
—Intensive surveillance of rubella and CRS.
–Prompt outbreak control when rubella occurs.
Vaccination of susceptible postpubertal females
Perhaps the final frontier in conquering rubella and CRS
can be reached by expanding and intensifying efforts to
vaccinate susceptible adolescents and young adults of
childbearing age, particularly those born outside the
United States.
These efforts should include vaccinating in family planning
clinics, sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, and as
part of routine gynecologic care; maximizing use of
premarital serology results; emphasizing immunization for
college students; vaccinating women postpartum and
postabortion; and immunizing prison staff, and when
possible, prison inmates, especially women inmates.

Recommendations for Increasing Coverage
• Continued routine vaccination of
children at >12 months with vaccination
required for school entry
• Screen and vaccinate susceptibles
- Health care workers
- College entry
• Premarital
- Prenatal with postpartum vaccination
• Other health care visits

Summary - Rubella
• Congenital rubella syndrome
• Increase efforts to vaccinate
childbearing-age women
• Included in 2 dose
recommendation for measles
• Arthropathy
Hospital rubella programs
Emphasis should be placed on vaccinating susceptible
hospital personnel, both male and female (volunteers,
trainees, nurses, physicians, etc.) Ideally, all hospital
employees should be immune. It is important to note that
screening programs alone are not adequate. Vaccination
of susceptible staff must follow.
Use of combination vaccines
The hope is that use of combination vaccines such as MR
and MMR vaccines and the two-dose schedule of MMR
vaccine for measles control will increase the level of
rubella seropositivity in children and adults. Persons
already immune to rubella should not have adverse events
attributable to rubella vaccine; those not already immune
are in need of vaccination against rubella.

ARICELLAIS ANACUTE, CONTAGIOUS DISEASE CAUSED BY
varicella zoster virus (VZV). The recurrent infection
(herpes zoster, also known as shingles) has been
recognized since ancient times. Primary varicella infection
(chickenpox) was not reliably distinguished from smallpox
until the end of the 19th century. In 1875, Steiner
demonstrated that chickenpox was caused by an infectious
agent by inoculating volunteers with the vesicular fluid
from a patient with acute varicella. Clinical observations of
the relationship between varicella and herpes zoster were
made in 1888 by von Bokay, when susceptible children
acquired varicella after contact with herpes zoster. VZV
was isolated from vesicular fluid of both chickenpox and
zoster lesions in cell culture by Thomas Weller in 1954.
Subsequent laboratory studies of the virus led to the
development of a live attenuated varicella vaccine in Japan
in the 1970s. The vaccine was licensed for use in healthy
children and adults in the United States in March 1995.
Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV)
VZV is a DNA virus, and is a member of the herpes virus
group. Like other herpes viruses, VZV has the capacity to
persist in the body after the primary (first) infection as a
latent infection. VZV persists in sensory nerve ganglia.
Primary infection with VZV results in chickenpox. Herpes
zoster (shingles) is the result of recurrent infection. The
virus has a short survival time outside the infected host.
Pathogenesis
VZV enters through the respiratory tract and conjunctiva.
The virus is believed to replicate at the site of entry in the
nasopharynx and in regional lymph nodes. A primary
viremia occurs 4-6 days after infection, which
disseminates the virus to other organs, such as the liver,
spleen, and sensory ganglia. Further replication occurs in
the viscera, followed by a secondary viremia, with viral

Varicella
Clinical Features
• Incubation period 14-16 days (range 10-21
days)
• Mild prodrome (fever, malaise) for 1-2 days
• Successive crops (2-4 days) of pruritic
vesicles
• Generally appear first on head; most
concentrated on trunk
infection of the skin. Virus can be cultured from
mononuclear cells of an infected person from 5 days before
to 1 or 2 days following the appearance of the rash.
Clinical Features
The incubation period is from 14 to 16 days from
exposure, with a range of 10 to 21 days. This may be
prolonged in immunocompromised patients and those who
have received varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG).
The incubation period may be up to 28 days after VZIG.
Primary infection (chickenpox)
A mild prodrome may preceed the onset of a rash. Adults
may have 1 to 2 days of fever and malaise prior to rash
onset, but in children the rash is often the first sign of
disease.
The rash is generalized, pruritic, and rapidly progresses
from macules to papules to vesicular lesions before
crusting. The rash usually appears first on the scalp,
moves to the trunk, and then the extremities, with the
highest concentration of lesions on the trunk. Lesions also
can occur on mucous membranes of the oropharynx,
respiratory tract, vagina, conjunctiva, and the cornea.
Lesions are usually 1 to 4 mm in diameter. The vesicles
contain clear fluid on an erythematous base that may
rupture or become purulent before they dry and crust.
Successive crops appear over several days, with lesions
present in several stages of evolution. For example,
macular lesions may be observed in the same area of skin
as mature vesicles. Healthy children usually have 200-500
lesions in 2 to 4 successive crops.
The clinical course in normal children is generally mild,
with malaise, pruritus (itching), and fever up to 102°F for
2 to 3 days. Adults may have more severe disease and have
a higher incidence of complications. Respiratory and
gastrointestinal symptoms are absent. Children with
lymphoma and leukemia may develop a severe progressive
form of varicella characterized by high fever, extensive
vesicular eruption, and high complication rates. Children
infected with human immunodeficiency virus may also
have severe, prolonged illness.
Recovery from primary varicella infection results in
lifetime immunity. In otherwise healthy persons, clinical
illness after reexposure is rare, but may occur in
immunocompromised persons. As with other viral
diseases, reexposure to natural (wild) varicella may lead
to reinfection that boosts antibody titers without causing
clinical illness or detectable viremia.

VARICELLA 1.93
Recurrent disease (herpes zoster)
Herpes zoster, or shingles, occurs when latent VZV
reactivates and causes recurrent disease. The immunologic
mechanism that controls latency of VZV is not well
understood. However, factors associated with recurrent
disease include aging, immunosuppression, intrauterine
exposure to VZV, and varicella at a young age (<18 months).
In immunocompromised persons, zoster may disseminate,
causing generalized skin lesions, and central nervous
system, pulmonary, and hepatic involvement.
The vesicular eruption of zoster generally occurs unilaterally
in the distribution of a dermatome supplied by a dorsal root
or extramedullary cranial nerve sensory ganglion. Most
often, this involves the trunk or the area of the fifth cranial
nerve. Two to four days prior to the eruption there may be
pain and paresthesia in the segment involved. There are few
systemic symptoms. Post-herpetic neuralgia, or pain in the
area of the recurrence which persists after the lesions have
resolved, is a distressing complication of zoster, with no
adequate therapy currently available. Post-herpetic
neuralgia may last as long as a year after the episode of
zoster. Ocular nerve and other organ involvement with
zoster can occur, often with severe sequelae.
Complications
Acute varicella is generally mild and self-limited, but may
be associated with complications. The most common
complications of varicella include secondary bacterial
infections of skin lesions, dehydration, pneumonia, and
central nervous system involvement. Secondary bacterial
infections of skin lesions with staphylococcus or
streptococcus are the most common cause of
hospitalization and outpatient medical visits. Secondary
infection with invasive group A streptococci may cause
serious illness and lead to hospitalization or death.
Pneumonia following varicella is usually viral, but may be
bacterial. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is more common
in children ‘1 year of age. Up to 30% of pneumonia cases
among healthy adults are fatal.
Central nervous system manifestations of varicella
range from aseptic meningitis to encephalitis.
Involvement of the cerebellum, with resulting cerebellar
ataxia, is the most common and generally has a good
outcome. Encephalitis is an infrequent complication of
varicella (estimated 1.8 per 10,000 cases), and may lead to
seizures and coma. Diffuse cerebral involvement is more
common in adults than in children.

Age in Years
Reye syndrome is an unusual complication of varicella
and influenza and occurs almost exclusively in children
who take aspirin during the acute illness. The etiology of
Reye syndrome is unknown. There has been a dramatic
decrease in the incidence of Reye syndrome during the
past decade, presumably related to decreased use of
aspirin by children.
Rare complications of varicella include aseptic meningitis,
transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome,
thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic varicella, purpura
fulminans, glomerulonephritis, myocarditis, arthritis,
orchitis, uveitis, iritis, and clinical hepatitis.
Approximately 10,000 persons with varicella require
hospitalization each year. Hospitalization rates are
approximately 2-3 per 1,000 cases among healthy children
and 8 per 1,000 cases among adults. Death occurs in
approximately 1 in 60,000 cases. From 1990 through 1996,
an average of 103 deaths from varicella was reported each
year. Most deaths occur in immunologically normal
children and adults.
The risk of complications from varicella varies with age.
Complications are infrequent among healthy children.
They are much higher in persons >15 years of age and
infants <1 year of age. For instance, among children 1-14
years of age, the fatality rate of varicella is approximately
1 per 100,000 cases. Among persons 15-19 years, the
fatality rate is 2.7 per 100,000 cases, and among adults 30-
49 years of age, 25.2 per 100,000 cases. Adults account for
only 5% of reported cases of varicella, but account for
approximately 35% of mortality.
Immunocompromised persons have a high risk of serious
varicella infection and a high risk of disseminated disease
(up to 36% in one report). These persons may have
multiple organ system involvement, and the disease may
become fulminant and hemorrhagic. The most frequent
complications in immunocompromised persons are
pneumonia and encephalitis.
Perinatal infection
The onset of maternal varicella from 5 days before to 2
days after delivery may result in overwhelming infection
of the neonate and a fatality rate as high as 30%. This
severe disease is believed to result from fetal exposure to
varicella virus without the benefit of passive maternal
antibody. Infants born to mothers with onset of maternal
varicella 5 days or more prior to delivery usually have a
benign course, presumably due to passive transfer of
maternal antibody across the placenta.

Congenital VZV infection
Primary varicella infection in the first 20 weeks of
gestation is occasionally associated with a variety of
abnormalities in the newborn, including low birth weight,
hypoplasia of an extremity, skin scarring, localized
muscular atrophy, encephalitis, cortical atrophy,
chorioretinitis, and microcephaly. This constellation of
abnormalities, collectively known as congenital varicella
syndrome, was first recognized in 1947. The risk of
congenital abnormalities from primary maternal varicella
infection during the first trimester is felt to be very low
(<2%). Rare reports of congenital birth defects following
maternal zoster exist, but virologic confirmation of
maternal lesions is lacking. Intrauterine infection with
VZV, particularly after 20 weeks gestation, is associated
with zoster in those infants at an earlier age; the exact
risk is unknown.
Laboratory Diagnosis
Laboratory diagnosis is not routinely required, but is
useful if confirmation of the diagnosis or determination of
susceptibility is necessary.
While rarely necessary for diagnosis, varicella zoster virus
may be isolated in tissue culture. The most frequent
source of isolation is vesicular fluid. The virus is difficult
to isolate from respiratory secretions.
Stained smears from vesicular scrapings (Tzanck smear)
may reveal multinucleated giant cells, consistent with
VZV and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. In some
instances, stains of vesicular scrapings may be tested
using a fluorescent monoclonal antibody test which is very
sensitive and specific.
A reliable history of chickenpox has been found to be a
valid measure of immunity to varicella because the rash is
distinctive, and subclinical cases are unusual. As a result,
serologic testing of children is generally not necessary.
However, serologic testing may be useful in adult
vaccination programs.

A variety of serologic tests for varicella antibody are
available. Available tests include compliment fixation
(CF), indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), fluorescent
antibody to membrane antigen (FAMA), neutralization,
indirect hemagglutination (IHA), immune adherence
hemagglutination (IAHA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), latex
agglutination (LA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). IFA, IAHA, FAMA, neutralization, and RIA
are sensitive tests, but are time consuming and have
requirements that make them unsuitable for general
diagnostic laboratories. Compliment fixation (CF) tests
have been widely used, but are the least sensitive test.
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is sensitive
and specific, simple to perform, and is widely available
commercially. A commercially available latex agglutination
(LA) is sensitive, and simple and rapid to perform. LA is
generally more sensitive than commercial ELISA tests.
Either of these tests would be useful for screening for
varicella immunity.
For the diagnosis of acute varicella infection, serologic
confirmation would include a significant rise in varicella
IgG by any standard serologic assay, or a single positive
serologic test for varicella IgM antibody
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Varicella and herpes zoster occur worldwide. There are
data that suggest that varicella infection is less common
in childhood in tropical areas, where chickenpox occurs
more commonly among adults. The reason(s) for this
difference in age distribution are not known with
certainty, but are believed to due to lack of childhood
varicella infection in rural populations.
Reservoir
Varicella is a human disease. No animal or insect source
or vector is known to exist.
Transmission
Infection with VZV occurs through the respiratory tract.
The most common mode of transmission of VZV is believed
to be person-to-person from infected respiratory tract
secretions. Transmission may also occur by respiratory
contact with airborne droplets, or by direct contact or
inhalation of aerosols from vesicular fluid of skin lesions
of acute varicella or zoster.

Temporal pattern
In temperate areas, varicella has a distinct seasonal Varicella - United States, 1986-1995
fluctuation, with the highest incidence occurring in winter ... cº-wºrthwºr
and early spring. In the United States, incidence is 40.000-

September and November. Less seasonality is reported in :
tropical areas. Herpes zoster has no seasonal variation
and occurs throughout the year.

Communicability
The period of communicability extends from 1 to 2 days
before the onset of rash through the first 4 to 5 days, or
until lesions have formed crusts. Immunocompromised
patients with progressive varicella are probably contagious
during the entire period new lesions are appearing. The
virus has not been isolated from crusted lesions.
Varicella is highly contagious. It is less contagious than
measles, but more so than mumps and rubella. Secondary
attack rates among susceptible household contacts of
persons with varicella are as high as 90% (that is, 9 out of
10 susceptible household contacts of persons with
varicella will become infected).
Secular Trends in the United States
Varicella is endemic in the United States and virtually all
persons acquire varicella by adulthood. As a result, the
number of cases occurring annually should approximate
the birth cohort, or approximately 4 million. Varicella was
removed from the list of nationally notifiable conditions in
1991, but some states continue to report cases to CDC.
Between 100,000 to 200,000 cases of varicella are reported Varicella Age-Specific Incidence
annually representing 3%-6% of all cases. Incidence is
expected to decline as vaccine coverage levels increase.
The majority of cases (approximately 85%) occur among
children less than 15 years of age. In the past, the highest
age-specific incidence of varicella was among children 5-9
years of age. However, in recent years, the highest <1 1-4 5-9-10-14 15-19 20+
incidence has shifted to children 1-4 years of age who Age group ſyrs)
account for 39% of all cases. This change in age
distribution is probably coincidental with earlier exposure
to VZV in preschool and child care settings. Children 5-9
years of age account for 38% of cases. Adults 20 years of
age and older account for only 7% of cases (National
Health Interview Survey data, 1990-1994).

Herpes zoster
Herpes zoster is not a notifiable condition. An estimated
300,000 episodes of zoster of occur annually. Ninety-five
percent of these episodes are first occurrences, and 5%
are recurrences. The risk of zoster increases with
increasing age. By age 80, almost 15% of persons will have
experienced at least one episode of zoster.
Varicella Vaccine
Characteristics
Varicella zoster vaccine is a live attenuated viral vaccine,
derived from the Oka strain of VZV. The vaccine virus was
isolated by Takahashi in the early 1970s from vesicular
fluid from a healthy child with varicella disease.
Varicella vaccine was licensed for general use in Japan and
Varicella Vaccine Korea in 1988. It was licensed in the United States in 1995.
• Composition Live virus (Oka-Merck strain) The virus was attenuated by sequential passage in human
º -iſºmº embryonic lung cell culture, embryonic guinea pig
• Efficacy 95% (Range, 65%-100%) fibroblasts, and in WI-38 human diploid cells. The Oka/
º >7 years Merck vaccine has undergone further passage through MRC-
5 human diploid cell cultures for a total of 31 passages.
• Schedule 1 Dose (<13 years of age)
May be administered simultaneously with The reconstituted vaccine contains small amounts of
measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine sucrose, processed porcine gelatine, sodium chloride,
monosodium L-glutamate, sodium diphosphate, potassium
phosphate, and potassium chloride, and trace quantities of
residual components of MRC-5 cells (DNA and protein),
EDTA, neomycin, and fetal bovine serum. The vaccine does
not contain egg, ovalbumin, or preservative.
Immunogenicityand vaccine efficacy
After one dose of vaccine, 97% of children 12 months to 12
years of age develop detectable antibody titers. Over 90%
of vaccine responders maintain antibody for at least 6
years. In Japanese studies, 97% of children had antibody 7
to 10 years after vaccination. Vaccine efficacy is estimated
to be 90% against infection, and 95% against severe
disease.
Among healthy adolescents and adults, an average of 78%
develop antibody after one dose and 99% develop antibody
after a second dose given 4 to 8 weeks later. Antibody has
persisted for at least 1 year in 97% of vaccinees after the
second dose given 4 to 8 weeks after the first dose. Studies
on the persistence of antibody and clinical efficacy in both
children and adults are ongoing.





## p. 199 (#211) ############################################

VAR/CELLA 1.99
Immunity appears to be long-lasting, and is probably
permanent in the majority of vaccinees. However,
approximately 1% of vaccinees per year have developed
breakthrough infections (i.e., developed varicella disease
even though they had responded to the vaccine). All
breakthrough infections have been mild, with fewer lesions
(generally fewer than 50), many of which are
maculopapular rather than vesicular. Most persons with
breakthrough infection do not have fever. There have been
no complications. Illness associated with breakthrough
infection has not increased in severity during the 7-10
years of follow-up study after vaccination.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Varicella virus vaccine is recommended for all
children without contraindications at 12–18 months of
age. The vaccine may be given to all children at this age
regardless of prior history of varicella. However,
immunization is not necessary in children with reliable
histories of chickenpox.
Varicella vaccine is also recommended for immunization
of all susceptible children by the 13th birthday. Children
who have not been immunized previously and who do not
have a reliable history of chickenpox are considered
susceptible. Efforts should be made to assure varicella
immunity by this age, because after 13 years of age varicella
disease is more severe, complications are more frequent, and
two doses of vaccine are required.
Varicella vaccine should be administered subcutaneously. It
has been shown to be safe and effective in healthy children
when administered at the same time as measles-mumps-
rubella (MMR) vaccine at separate sites and with separate
syringes. If varicella and MMR vaccines are not administered
at the same visit, they should be separated by at least 28 days.
Varicella vaccine may also be administered simultaneously
(but at separate sites with separate syringes) as all other
childhood vaccines (DTP/DTaP. Haemophilus influenzae type
b, hepatitis B, IPV/OPV). The Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) strongly recommends that
varicella vaccine be administered simultaneously with all
other vaccines recommended at 12 to 18 months of age.
Children with a reliable history of chickenpox can be
assumed to be immune to varicella. A parental history is
acceptable, and physician documentation is not necessary.
Children without a reliable history, or with an uncertain
history of chickenpox should be considered susceptible.
Serologic testing of such children prior to vaccination is not
warranted, because the majority of children between 12
months and 12 years of age without a clinical history of
chickenpox are susceptible. Prior history of chickenpox is
not a contraindication to varicella vaccination.
Breakthrough Infection
• Immunity appears to be longlasting
• 1% of recipients of current lots per year
develop chickenpox
• Breakthrough disease much milder than
in unvaccinated persons
• No evidence that risk of breakthrough
infection increases with time since
vaccination

first dose, the second dose may be administered without
repeating the first dose.
Adolescents and adults with reliable parental or personal
histories of chickenpox can be assumed to be immune.
Those without a reliable history can be considered to be
susceptible, or may be tested to determine varicella
immunity. Epidemiologic and serologic studies indicate
that over 90% of adults are immune to varicella. In
addition, 71% to 93% of adults without a reliable history of
chickenpox are actually immune. As a result, serologic
testing prior to vaccination is likely to be cost effective for
adults. As with children, a prior history of chickenpox is
not a contraindication to varicella vaccination.
Assessment of varicella immunity of all adolescents and
adults, and vaccination of those who are susceptible, is
desirable to protect these individuals from the higher risk
of complications from acquired varicella. Vaccination may
be offered at the time of routine health care visits.
However, specific assessment efforts should be focused on
adolescents and adults who are at highest risk of exposure,
and those most likely to transmit varicella to others.
Varicella vaccination should be considered for
susceptible adolescents and adults who are high risk
of exposure to varicella. This group includes persons
who live or work in environments in which there is a high
likelihood of transmission of varicella, such as teachers of
young children, day care workers, and residents and staff
in institutional settings; persons who live or work in
environments in which varicella transmission may occur
(e.g. college students, inmates and staff of correctional
institutions, and military personnel); nonpregnant women
of childbearing age, in order to reduce the risk of VZV
transmission to the fetus if the susceptible woman should
develop varicella during pregnancy; and international
travelers.
Varicella vaccination is also recommended for susceptible
adolescents and adults who will have close contact
with persons at high risk for serious complications of
acquired varicella. This group would include health care
workers and susceptible family contacts of
immunocompromised individuals.

VAR/CELLA
The ACIP recommends that all health care workers be
immune to varicella, either from a reliable history of
varicella disease or vaccination. In health care settings,
serologic screening of personnel who are uncertain of
their varicella history, or who claim not to have had the
disease, is likely to be cost effective. Testing for varicella
immunity following two doses of vaccine is not considered
necessary because 99% of persons are seropositive after
the second dose.
Seroconversion may not always result in full protection
against disease (see section on immunogenicity and
vaccine efficacy for information on breakthrough
infection). If a vaccinated health care worker is exposed to
varicella, the exposed person should be tested for
varicella antibody as soon as possible following the
exposure. Persons with detectable antibody are unlikely
to develop varicella. Persons without antibody can be
retested 5-6 days later to determine if an anamnestic
response is present (i.e., antibody appears quickly after
exposure). If antibody is present less than 7 days after
exposure it is unlikely that the exposed person will
develop disease. Persons who remain susceptible (i.e.,
antibody negative) 7 days following exposure should be
furloughed, or monitored very closely and then furloughed
at the onset of symptoms suggestive of varicella.
The risk of transmission of vaccine virus from a vaccinated
person to a susceptible contact appears to be very low (see
below), and the benefits of vaccinating susceptible health
care workers clearly outweigh this potential risk.
Transmission of vaccine virus appears to occur primarily if
and when the vaccines develops a vaccine-associated rash. As
a safeguard, institutions may wish to consider precautions
for personnel who develop a rash following vaccination (e.g.,
avoidance of contact with persons at high risk of serious
complications, such as immunosuppressed persons).
Post-exposure prophylaxis
There are few data on post-exposure efficacy of the
current varicella vaccine. Post-exposure prophylaxis of
children with earlier formulations of vaccine suggests that
the vaccine may prevent infection in up to 90% of children
when the vaccine is given within 3 days of exposure.
However, until additional data are available, vaccine
should not be relied upon to prevent varicella if
administered after exposure has occurred. Vaccination
should be considered for unvaccinated susceptible health
care workers who are exposed to varicella disease.
However, because the protective effects of postexposure
vaccination are unknown, persons vaccinated following an
exposure should be managed as if they were susceptible.
Vaccination of Health Care Workers
• Recommended for all susceptible
health care workers
• Prevaccination serologic screening
probably cost effective
• Postvaccination testing not necessary
• Risk of transmission to patients low

Varicella Vaccine
Adverse Reactions
• Injection site complaints - 20%
• Rash - 3%–4%
- May be maculopapular rather
than vesicular
- Average 5 lesions
• Systemic reactions uncommon
Zoster Following Vaccination
• Most cases in children
• Risk from wild virus 4 to 5 times
higher than from vaccine virus
• Mild illness without complications
Varicella Vaccine
Contraindications and Precautions
• Severe allergy to vaccine component
or prior dose of vaccine
• Pregnancy
• Immunosuppression
• Moderate or severe acute illness
• Recent blood product
Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
The most common adverse reactions following varicella
vaccine are injection site complaints such as pain,
soreness, redness, and swelling. Based on information
from the manufacturer's clinical trials of varicella vaccine,
local reactions are reported by 19% of children, and by
24% of adolescents and adults (33% following the second
dose). These local adverse events are generally mild and
self-limited. A varicella-like rash at injection site is
reported by 3% of children, and by 1% of adolescents and
adults following the second dose. In both circumstances,
there has been a median of two lesions. These lesions
generally occur within 2 weeks, and are most commonly
maculopapular rather than vesicular.
A generalized varicella-like rash is reported by 4% to 6%
of recipients of varicella vaccine (1% after the second dose
in adolescents and adults), with a median of five lesions.
Most of these generalized rashes occur within 3 weeks and
most are maculopapular.
Fever within 42 days of vaccination is reported by 15% of
children and 10% of adolescents and adults. The majority
of these episodes of fever have been attributed to
intercurrent illness rather than to the vaccine.
Varicella vaccine is a live virus vaccine, and results in a
latent infection, similar to that caused by wild varicella
virus. Consequently, zoster caused by the vaccine virus
has been reported. To date, fewer than 50 reports of zoster
in a vaccinated person, mostly children, have been
received. Not all these cases have been confirmed as
having been caused by vaccine virus. Among children, the
rate of zoster following varicella vaccine is estimated to be
18 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation. This rate
is 4-5 times less than the estimated 77 cases per 100,000
person-years of observation for persons infected with wild
varicella virus. All cases of zoster following vaccine have
been mild and have not been associated with
complications, including post-herpetic neuralgia.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Contraindications and precautions to varicella vaccine are
similar to those for other live attenuated vaccines.
Persons with a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine
component or following a prior dose of vaccine should
not receive varicella vaccine. Varicella vaccine contains
minute amounts of neomycin and gelatin, but does not
contain egg protein or preservatives.

Persons with immunosuppression due to leukemia,
lymphoma, generalized malignancy, immune deficiency
disease, or immunosuppressive therapy should not be
vaccinated. However, treatment with low dose (<2 mg/kg/
day), alternate day, topical, replacement, or aerosolized
steroid preparations is not a contraindication to varicella
vaccination. Persons whose immunosuppressive therapy
with steroids has been stopped for 1 month (3 months for
chemotherapy) may be vaccinated. Varicella vaccine is
available from the manufacturer under a research protocol
for special use in certain patients with acute lymphoblastic
leukemia in remission. Please consult the ACIP statement
or contact the manufacturer for further information.
Few data exist on the use of varicella vaccine in persons
with asymptomatic or symptomatic infection with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). At this time, varicella
vaccine is not recommended for persons known to be
infected with HIV, regardless of the degree of
immunosuppression. However, routine testing for HIV
infection of asymptomatic children who come for
vaccination is not recommended. If inadvertent vaccination
of an HIV-infected person results in clinical illness, the use
of acyclovir may modify the severity of the disease.
Women known to be pregnant or attempting to become
pregnant should not receive varicella vaccine. The effects of
varicella vaccine on a developing fetus are unknown. Since
infection with wild varicella virus poses only a small risk to
the fetus, and the vaccine virus is attenuated, the risk to the
fetus, if any, should be even lower. Although the
manufacturer's package insert states otherwise, ACIP and the
American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that pregnancy
be avoided for 1 month following receipt of varicella vaccine.
The manufacturer, in collaboration with the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention has established a
Varicella Vaccination in Pregnancy registry to monitor
the maternal-fetal outcomes of pregnant women
inadvertently given varicella vaccine. The telephone
number for the Registry is 1-800-986-8999.
Vaccination of persons with moderate or severe acute
illnesses should be postponed until the condition has
improved. This precaution is intended to prevent
complicating the management of an ill patient with a
potential vaccine adverse event, such as fever. Minor
illness, such as otitis media and upper respiratory
infections, concurrent antibiotic therapy, and exposure or
recovery from other illnesses are not contraindications to
varicella vaccine. Although there is no evidence that
either varicella or varicella vaccine exacerbates
tuberculosis, vaccination is not recommended for persons
known to have untreated active tuberculosis. Tuberculosis
skin testing is not a prerequisite for varicella vaccination.

Contacts
• Risk of transmission increased if
vaccinee develops rash
Varicella Vaccine
Storage and Handling
• Store frozen at +5F (-15C)
• Transport on dry ice
• Should not be refrozen
• Discard if not used within 30
minutes of reconstitution
The effect of the administration of antibody-containing
blood products (e.g., immune globulin, whole blood or
packed red blood cells, intravenous immune globulin,
varicella zoster immune globulin [VZIG]) on the response
to varicella vaccine virus is unknown. Because of the
potential inhibition of the response to varicella
vaccination by passively transferred antibodies, varicella
vaccine should not be given for at least 5 months after
antibody-containing blood products. Immune globulin or
VZIG should not be given for 3 weeks following
vaccination unless the benefits exceed those of the
vaccine. In such cases, the vaccinees should either be
revaccinated 5 months later or tested for immunity 6
months later and revaccinated if seronegative.
No adverse events following varicella vaccination related
to the use of salicylates (e.g., aspirin) have been reported
to date. However, the manufacturer recommends that
vaccine recipients should avoid the use of salicylates for 6
weeks after receiving varicella vaccine because of the
association between aspirin use and Reye syndrome
following chickenpox.
Transmission of varicella vaccine virus
Available data suggest that healthy children have limited
potential to transmit vaccine virus to susceptible contacts.
To date, fewer than 50 instances of suspected secondary
transmission of vaccine virus have been reported.
However, in only one case has the secondary clinical illness
been shown to be caused by vaccine virus. This is the only
documented case of transmission with symptomatic illness
in over six million doses distributed to date. Several other
cases of suspected secondary transmission have been
determined to have been caused by wild varicella virus.
However, in studies of household contacts, several
instances of asymptomatic seroconversion have been
observed. It appears that transmission occurs mainly, and
perhaps only, when the vaccinee develops a rash. If a
vaccinated child develops a rash, it is recommended that
close contact with persons at high risk of complications of
varicella, such as immunocompromised persons, be avoided
until the rash has resolved.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Varicella vaccine is very fragile and must be handled with
extreme care. To maintain potency, the lyophilized vaccine
must be stored frozen at an average temperature of +59F
(-15°C). Household freezers, including frost-free models,
manufactured within the last 5-10 years, are designed to
maintain temperatures as low as -4°F (-20°C), and are
acceptable for storage of the vaccine. Refrigerators with

VAR/CELLA 20s.
ice compartments that are not tightly enclosed or are
enclosed with unsealed, uninsulated doors (i.e., small
dormitory-style refrigerator/freezer combinations) will
generally not be capable of maintaining the required
storage temperature. Regardless of the type of freezer,
providers should check the adequacy of their freezer
storage before obtaining vaccine by monitoring and
verifying the temperature of their freezer.
The vaccine diluent should be stored separately at room
temperature or in the refrigerator. The vaccine should be
reconstituted according to the directions in the package
insert and only with the diluent supplied, which does not
contain preservative or other anti-viral substances that
might inactivate the vaccine virus. Once reconstituted, the
vaccine must be used immediately to minimize loss of
potency. The vaccine must be discarded if not used within
30 minutes of reconstitution.
If varicella vaccine is inadvertently placed in the
refrigerator, or if lyophilized vaccine is left at room
temperature for a short time, it may still be potent enough
to use. Mishandled vaccine should be clearly marked and
replaced in the freezer separate from properly handled Varicella Vaccine
vaccine. After storing the vaccine, the manufacturer must Information
be contacted for recommendations before any of the
mishandled vaccine is used. The Merck Vaccine Division
varicella information telephone number is 1-800-
9VARIVAX (1-800-982-7482). If the vaccine has been kept 1 - 800 - 9VARIVAX
cold, or has been exposed to room temperature for a very
short time, the manufacturer may recommend that the (1-800-982-7482)
expiration date be shortened, and that the vaccine be used
as quickly as possible. Mishandled vaccine should never be
destroyed until the manufacturer has been consulted.
Because of the lability of varicella vaccine, transport of
the vaccine from a central clinic or storage area to an off-
site clinic will be very difficult. Until more information on
the stability of the vaccine at higher-than-recommended
temperatures is available, such off-site transport is
discouraged. If off-site transport is attempted, a high-
quality container should be used, the vaccine should be
transported on dry ice, and the temperature should be
monitored continuously, to assure that the appropriate
storage temperature is maintained.

Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG)
• May modify or prevent disease if given ‘96
hours after exposure
• Immunocompromised
• Newborn of mothers with infection 5 days
before to 2 days after birth
• Premature infants with postnatal exposure
• Susceptible adults and pregnant women
Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (VZIG)
VZIG is a human blood product that contains high titers of
varicella zoster virus antibody. It was licensed in 1981, and
is available throughout the country from the
American Red Cross. If administered within 96 hours of
exposure, VZIG can modify or prevent clinical varicella
and prevent complications or death, especially in
susceptible immunocompromised individuals.
The decision to administer VZIG should be based on
whether the patient is susceptible either by having a
negative history of chickenpox or by lacking documentation
of vaccination, whether the exposure is likely to result in
infection and, most importantly, whether the patient is at
greater risk of complications than the general population.
VZIG is expensive ($400-$500 for the maximum dose in an
adult) and provides only temporary protection.
VZIG is indicated for use in susceptible individuals at high
risk for complications who have had a significant exposure
(continuous household contact; playmate contact of over an
hour; hospital contact in the same 2- to 4-bed room; or
prolonged direct contact) to a person with varicella. It is
most commonly used for post-exposure prophylaxis of
immunocompromised children (immune deficiencies,
neoplastic disease, or on immunosuppressive therapy), and
newborns of mothers with varicella onset 5 days before to 48
hours days after delivery. It is also recommended for
premature infants with postnatal exposure, including those
born at less than 28 weeks gestation or less than 1,000 gram
birth weight (who may not have received adequate maternal
antibody regardless of whether the mother is immune), or
premature infants whose mother is not immune to varicella.
Healthy and immunocompromised adults and pregnant
women are at increased risk of complications of varicella.
VZIG should be considered if such individuals are
considered to be susceptible. There is no evidence that
VZIG will prevent congenital varicella if given as post-
exposure prophylaxis to a pregnant woman.
VZIG is supplied in vials containing 125 or 625 units. The
recommended dose considered likely to prevent or modify
varicella is 125 units per 10 kilograms of body weight, up to a
maximum of 625 units, or five vials. Higher doses can be
considered for immunosuppressed persons. VZIG is given
intramuscularly, and must never be given intravenously. It
should be given within 96 hours of exposure, preferably as
soon as possible. The administration of VZIG may prolong the
incubation period of varicella to 28 days or longer post-exposure.
More detailed information on the evaluation of a person
exposed to varicella and the use of VZIG may be found in
the varicella ACIP statement.

Special Varicella Exposure Situations
Hospital personnel
Susceptible workers with significant exposure to varicella
should be relieved from direct patient contact from day 10
to day 21 after exposure. If workers develop chickenpox,
varicella lesions must be crusted before they return to
direct patient contact. Receipt of VZIG does not change this
recommendation for reassignment. Since VZIG can prolong
the incubation period, the period of removal from direct
patient contact should be lengthened by 1 week or more.
Newborns
Newborn with maternal rash onset 5 days before to 48
hours after delivery should receive VZIG. Since about
50% of infants who receive VZIG will develop varicella, if
these infants remain hospitalized beyond age 10 days, they
should be kept in strict isolation for the entire incubation
period (until day 28 or longer).
Acyclovir

Acyclovir is a synthetic nucleoside analog that inhibits - Healthy non-pregnant persons-13-years of age
replication of human herpes viruses, including VZV.
Intravenous acyclovir has been available since the early
1980s for use in immunocompromised patients with
varicella. Oral acyclovir was approved in 1992 for the
treatment of chickenpox in otherwise healthy children.
Clinical studies indicate that acyclovir may be beneficial if
given within 24 hours of onset of rash, resulting in
reductions in the number of days new lesions appeared, in
the duration of fever, and in the severity of cutaneous and
systemic signs and symptoms. Acyclovir has not been
shown to decrease transmission of varicella, reduce the
duration of absence from school, or reduce complications.

ACIP has not made recommendations regarding the use of
acyclovir. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does
not consider acyclovir in healthy children of sufficient
benefit to justify routine administration to normal
children. Because complicated varicella and more severe
disease may occur in adolescents and adults or secondary
cases in the household, AAP considered these appropriate
situations for use of the drug. Acyclovir may also be
considered for children over 12 months of age with a
chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorder, or on salicylate
therapy, and for children receiving short, intermittent or
aerosolized courses of corticosteroids. If the child is
immunocompromised, intravenous administration is
indicated. Corticosteroids should be discontinued, if
possible, after exposure.

Hepatitis A
HE FIRST DESCRIPTIONS OF HEPATITIs (EPIDEMIC jaundice) are
generally attributed to Hippocrates. Outbreaks of
jaundice, probably hepatitis A, were reported in the
17th and 18th centuries, particularly in association with
military campaigns. Hepatitis A (formerly called infectious
hepatitis) was differentiated epidemiologically from long-
incubation period hepatitis B in the 1940s. The
development of serologic tests allowed definitive diagnosis
of hepatitis B. Identification of the virus, and development
of serologic tests in the 1970s helped differentiate
hepatitis A from other types of non-B hepatitis.
Hepatitis A is the most common type of hepatitis reported
in the United States. Until recently, the primary methods
used for preventing hepatitis A have been hygienic
measures and passive immunization with immune globulin
(IG) to provide short-term protection. Hepatitis A vaccines
have now been developed and licensed for use in persons
>2 years of age, and can provide long term protection
against hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. The similarities
between the epidemiology of hepatitis A and poliomyelitis
suggest that widespread vaccination of appropriate
susceptible populations can substantially lower disease
incidence, eliminate virus transmission, and ultimately,
eradicate HAV infection.
Hepatitis A Virus
Hepatitis A is caused by infection with HAV, a non-
enveloped RNA agent that is classified as a picornavirus.
It was first isolated in 1979. Humans are the only natural
host, although several nonhuman primates may be
experimentally infected. Depending on conditions, HAV
can be stable in the environment for months. The virus is
relatively stable at low pH levels and moderate
temperatures, but can be inactivated by high temperature
(>1859F), formalin, and chlorine.

Hepatitis A
Pathogenesis
• Entry into mouth
• Viral replication in the liver
• Virus present in blood and feces
after about 2 weeks
• Illness usually self-limited
Hepatitis A
Clinical Features
• Incubation period 15-50 days
• Illness not specific for hepatitis A
• Age-related clinical illness
• Children generally asymptomatic,
adults symptomatic
Pathogenesis
HAV is acquired by mouth (fecal-oral) and replicates in the
liver. After 10-12 days, virus is present in blood and in the
feces. Peak titers occur during the 2 weeks before and 1
week after onset of illness. Although virus is present in
serum, its concentration is several orders of magnitude
less than in feces. Therefore, the most common mode of
HAV transmission is fecal-oral with the virus being
transmitted from person-to-person between household
contacts or sex partners, or by contaminated food or water.
Because virus is present in serum during acute infection,
blood borne HAV transmission can occur, but it has been
reported infrequently.
Clinical Features
The clinical course of acute hepatitis A is indistinguishable
from that of other types of acute viral hepatitis. The
incubation period of hepatitis A is 15–50 days, with an
average of 28 days. The illness typically has an abrupt
onset of signs and symptoms that include fever, malaise,
anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark urine and
jaundice. Clinical illness usually does not last longer than
2 months, although 10-15% of persons have prolonged or
relapsing signs and symptoms for up to 6 months.
The likelihood of symptomatic illness from HAV infection
is directly related to age. Among children -6 years of age,
most (70%) infections are asymptomatic. Among older
children and adults, infection is usually symptomatic with
jaundice occurring in >70% of patients. HAV infection
occasionally produces fulminant hepatitis A.
Complications
Fulminant hepatitis A leads to about 100 deaths per year in
the U.S. The case-fatality rate among reported cases of all
ages is approximately 0.3%, but can be higher among older
persons (approximately 2% among persons >40 years of age).
Hepatitis A results in substantial morbidity with associated
costs caused by medical care and work loss. Hospitalization
rates for hepatitis A are 11%-22%. Adults who become ill
lose an average of 27 work days per illness and health
departments incur the costs of postexposure prophylaxis for
11 contacts per case. Average direct and indirect costs of
hepatitis A range from $1,817 to $2,459 per adult case and
$433 to $1,492 per pediatric case. In 1989, the estimated
annual U.S. total cost of hepatitis A was >S200 million.








## p. 211 (#223) ############################################

HEPATITIS A
Laboratory Diagnosis
Hepatitis A is diagnosed serologically. Virtually all
patients with acute hepatitis A have detectable anti-HAV
IgM antibody. The diagnosis of acute HAV infection is
confirmed during the acute or early convalescent phase of
infection by the presence of anti-HAV IgM antibody in
serum. IgM generally disappears within 6 months after
onset of symptoms.
Anti-HAV IgG antibody appears in the convalescent phase
of infection, remains present in serum for the lifetime of
the person and confers enduring protection against
disease. The antibody test for total anti-HAV measures
both anti-HAV IgG and anti-HAV IgM. Persons who are
total anti-HAV positive and anti-HAV IgM negative have
serologic markers indicating immunity consistent with
either past infection or vaccination.
Commercial diagnostic tests are widely available for the
detection of IgM and total (IgM and IgG) antibody in serum.
IgM becomes detectable 5-10 days after exposure and can
persist for up to 6 months after infection. IgG appears early
in the course of infection, remains detectable for the
person's lifetime, and confers lifelong immunity.
Occasionally molecular virology methods such as
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, are used to
amplify and sequence viral genomes. These assays are
helpful to investigate common source outbreaks of
hepatitis A. Providers with questions about molecular
virology methods should consult with their state health
department or the Hepatitis Branch, CDC.
Medical Management
There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A virus
infection. Treatment and management of HAV infection is
supportive.

Reservoir
• Temporal pattern None
Humans are the only natural reservoir of the virus. There
are no insect or animal vectors. A chronic HAV carrier
state has not been reported.
Transmission
HAV infection is acquired primarily by the fecal-oral route
by either person-to-person contact or ingestion of
contaminated food or water. Because the virus is present in
blood during the illness prodrome, HAV has been
transmitted on rare occasions by transfusion. Transmission
by saliva has not been demonstrated. Waterborne outbreaks
are infrequent and are usually associated with sewage-
contaminated or inadequately treated water.
Temporal Pattern
There is no appreciable seasonal variation in hepatitis A
incidence.
Communicability
Viral shedding persists for 1 to 3 weeks. One to 2 weeks
before the illness' onset, HAV titers in stool peak, and
infected persons are most likely to transmit HAV. The risk
then decreases and is minimal the week after the onset of
jaundice.
Source of infection
Among cases reported to CDC, the most frequently
* , reported source of infection is household or sexual contact

Groups at increased risk of hepatitis A or its complications
include international travelers, men who have sex with
men, and injecting drug users. Outbreaks of hepatitis A
have also been reported among person working with
nonhuman primates. This is the only occupational group
known to be at increased risk of hepatitis A.
Persons with chronic liver disease are not at increased
risk of infection, but are at increased risk of fulminant
hepatitis A. Persons with clotting-factor disorders may be
at increased risk of HAV because of administration of
solvent-detergent-treated factor VIII and IX concentrates.
Food handlers are not at increased risk for hepatitis A
because of their occupation, but are noteworthy because of
their critical role in common-source foodborne HAV
transmission. Health-care workers do not have an
increased prevalence of HAV infections, and nosocomial
HAV transmission is rare. Nonetheless, outbreaks have
been observed in neonatal intensive-care units and in
association with adult fecal incontinence. Institutions for
persons with developmental disabilities previously were
sites of high HAV endemicity. But as fewer children have
been institutionalized and conditions within these
institutions have improved, HAV incidence and prevalence
have decreased. However, sporadic outbreaks can occur.
Schools are not common sites for HAV transmission.
Multiple cases among children at a school require
investigation of a common source. Workers exposed to
sewage have not reported any work-related HAV infection
in the U.S., but serologic data are not available.
Secular Trends in the United States
In the United States, hepatitis A has occurred in large
nationwide epidemics approximately every 10 years, with
the last increase in cases in 1989. However, between
epidemics HAV infection continues to occur at relatively
high rates. Hepatitis A became nationally reportable as a
distinct entity in 1966. The largest number of cases
reported in one year (59,606) was in 1971. An average of
27,000 cases have been reported annually in the United
States since 1990, with 30,021 cases reported in 1997. An
estimated incidence of 80,000 to 134,000 cases per year
takes under-reporting and asymptomatic infections into
account. Based on testing from phase 1 of the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) conducted in 1989–1991, the prevalence of
total antibody to HAV (anti-HAV) among the general U.S.
population is 33%.

HEPATITIS A
Many hepatitis A cases in the United States occur in the
context of community-wide epidemics. Communities which
experience such epidemics can be classified as high-rate and
intermediate-rate communities. High-rate communities
typically have epidemics every 5–10 years that may last for
several years with substantial rates of disease (as high as
2,000 cases per 100,000 population annually during
outbreaks) and few cases among persons ~15 years of age.
These communities often are relatively well-defined either
geographically or ethnically and include Native American,
Alaskan Native, Pacific Islander, selected Hispanic
communities, and certain religious communities.
In intermediate-rate communities, hepatitis A cases
occur primarily among children, adolescents, and young
adults. Epidemics often occur at regular intervals and
persist for several years with rates typically between 50
and 200 cases per 100,000 per year. However, some
communities experience sustained elevated rates. Often
cases are concentrated in specific census tracts or
neighborhoods within a larger community. In these
communities, children with asymptomatic HAV infection
can be a substantial source of infection for older persons
during community-wide outbreaks.
Hepatitis A Antibod
Seroprevalence by Age Group
Percent
20-29 40-49
Age group ſyrs)
The highest rates of hepatitis A are among children 5-14
years of age. Almost 30% of reported cases occur among
children -15 years of age. HAV antibody (IgG) prevalence,
which reflects lifetime exposure, is directly related to age:
10% at ~ 10 years old, 18% at 20-29 years old, 49% at 40-49
years old, and 75% for those > 70 years old. Anti-HAV
prevalence is highest among Mexican-Americans (67%),
compared with blacks (37%) and whites (29%). Anti-HAV
prevalence is inversely related to income.
Although better hygienic and sanitary conditions have
lowered the incidence of HAV infection and passive
immunization with IG has been available for decades, high
disease rates among many population segments and
continued community-wide outbreaks indicate that HAV
remains a major public health problem.
Case Definition
The following case definition for hepatitis A was
recommended by the Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists (CSTE) in 1994. It reflects a clinical
diagnosis of hepatitis and, because HAV cannot be
differentiated from other types of viral hepatitis on
clinical or epidemiologic features alone, serologic evidence
of HAV-specific IgM antibody is necessary.









## p. 215 (#227) ############################################

AIEPA777/S A
The clinical case definition describes hepatitis A as an
acute illness with discrete onset of symptoms, and
jaundice or elevated serum aminotransferase levels. The
laboratory criterion for diagnosis is a positive anti-HAV
IgM regardless of HBs.Ag status or a significant rise in
anti-HAV IgG between acute and convalescent specimens.
Hepatitis A Vaccine
Characteristics
Two inactivated whole virus hepatitis A vaccines are
available: Havrix” (SmithKline Beecham Biologicals) and
VAQTA* (Merck and Co., Inc.). To produce each vaccine,
cell-culture-adapted virus is propagated in human
fibroblasts, purified from cell lysates, inactivated with
formalin, and adsorbed to an aluminum hydroxide
adjuvant. HAVRIX* is prepared with a preservative (2-
phenoxyathanol); VAQTA* is not. Both vaccines are
available in both pediatric and adult formulations.
Neither vaccine is currently licensed for children -2
years of age.
Immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy
Both vaccines are highly immunogenic. More than 90% of
adults will develop protective antibody within 2 weeks of a
single dose of either vaccine and nearly 100 percent will
seroconvert within a month. Among children and
adolescents, over 95% will be seropositive within a month
of the first dose.
Both vaccines are highly effective in the prevention of
clinical hepatitis A. The efficacy of HAVRIX* in protecting
against clinical hepatitis A was 94% among 40,000 Thai
children 1-16 years of age who received 2 doses one month
apart while living in villages with high HAV disease rates.
The efficacy of VAQTA* in protecting against clinical
hepatitis A was 100% among 1,000 New York children 2-16
years of age who received 1 dose while living in a
community with a high HAV disease rate.
Data concerning the long-term persistence of antibody and
of immune memory are limited because the currently
available vaccines have been under evaluation for only 5-6
years. Estimates of antibody persistence derived from
kinetic models of antibody decline indicate that protective
levels of anti-HAV could be present for >20 years. Other
mechanisms (e.g., cellular) may contribute to long-term
protection, but this is unknown. The need for booster doses
will be determined by postmarketing surveillance studies.

HEPAT/TIS A
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Because of their critical role in HAV transmission,
children should be a primary focus of immunization
strategies to lower disease incidence. However, the lack of
data on the appropriate dose and timing of vaccination for
children ‘2 years old presents a barrier to this strategy. A
substantial reduction in the national incidence of disease
cannot be expected until hepatitis A vaccine is included in
the routine childhood immunization schedule and
successive cohorts of children are vaccinated.
The interim strategy to prevent and control HAV focuses
on preexposure vaccination of persons at increased risk for
HAV infection or its consequences and children living in
communities that have intermediate or high rates of
hepatitis A.
Havrix” is available in 2 formulations, pediatric and adult.
For children 2-18 years of age, the 360 ELISA units (EL.U.)
per dose vaccine is used and, the schedule is 2 doses
separated by one month, followed by a booster dose 6-12
months after the second dose. For the 720 E.L.U. vaccine,
a single primary dose is recommended, followed by a
booster dose 6-12 months later. For adults - 18 years of
age, the 1440 EL.U. per dose vaccine is used. Adults
receive one dose followed by a booster 6-12 months later.
The vaccine should be administered intramuscularly into
the deltoid muscle. A needle length appropriate for the
vaccinee's age and size should be used.

Data on the interchangeability of vaccines from different
manufacturers are not available. Completion of the
regimen with the same product is preferable. However, if
the originally-used product is not available or not known,
vaccination with either product is acceptable. Children's
whose first dose was Havrix* 360 EL.U. or unknown
should receive two doses of any pediatric HAV vaccine
formulation.
Studies among adults do not indicate a decrease in
immunogenicity or an increase in adverse events when
hepatitis A vaccine is administered at the same time as
other vaccines. Similar studies among infants are in
progress.
Candidates for Vaccination
Routine vaccination with hepatitis A vaccine is not
currently recommended, although vaccination
requirements for school and day care attendance exist in
some areas of the United States.
Persons at increased risk for hepatitis A should be
identified and vaccinated. Hepatitis A vaccine should be
strongly considered for persons 2 years of age and older
who are traveling to or working in countries with high
or intermediate risk of hepatitis A virus infection.
These areas include all areas of the world except Canada,
Western Europe and Scandinavia, Japan, New Zealand,
and Australia. Vaccinated persons can be assumed to be
protected by 4 weeks after receiving the first dose,
although the second dose 6 to 12 months later is necessary.
In addition to travelers, the vaccine should be given
routinely to children 2 years of age and older living in
communities with high rates of hepatitis A infection
or periodic hepatitis A outbreaks. Such groups include
Native American, Alaskan Native, and Pacific Islander
populations, as well as certain religious communities.
Other groups which may be offered vaccine include men

who have sex with other men, drug users, persons
with chronic liver disease (including hepatitis C), and
persons with occupational risk of infection. Persons
with occupational risk include only those who work with
hepatitis A-infected primates or with hepatitis A virus in a
laboratory setting. No other groups have been shown to be
at increased risk of hepatitis A infection due to
occupational exposure.
Hepatitis A vaccination is not routinely recommended
for health care workers, persons attending or
working in day care centers, or persons who work in
liquid or solid waste management (e.g., sewer workers
or plumbers). These groups have not been shown to be at
increased risk of hepatitis A infection. ACIP does not
recommend routine hepatitis A vaccination for food
service workers, but vaccination may be considered
based on local epidemiology.
Prevaccination serologic testing
HAV infection produces lifelong immunity to hepatitis A, so
there is no benefit of vaccinating someone with serologic
evidence of past HAV infection. The risk for adverse events
following vaccination of such persons is not higher than the
risk for serologically negative populations. As a result, the
decision to conduct prevaccination testing should be based
chiefly on the prevalence of immunity, the cost of testing
and vaccinating (including office visit costs), and the
likelihood that testing will interfere with initiating
vaccination.
Testing of children is not indicated because of their
expected low prevalence of infection. Persons for whom
prevaccination serologic testing will likely be most cost
effective include adults who were either born in or lived
for extensive periods in geographic areas that have a high
endemicity of HAV infection (e.g., Central and South
America, Africa, Asia); older adolescents and adults in
certain populations (i.e., Native Americans, Alaskan
Natives, and Hispanics); adults in certain groups that have
a high prevalence of infection (see above); and adults -40
years of age.
Commercially available tests for total anti-HAV should be
used for prevaccination testing.





## p. 219 (#231) ############################################

HEPA777/S A
Post-vaccination serologic testing
Post-vaccination testing is not indicated because of the
high rate of vaccine response among adults and children.
Testing methods sufficiently sensitive to detect low anti-
HAV concentrations after vaccination are not approved for
routine diagnostic use in the U.S.
Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
For both vaccines, the most commonly reported adverse
reaction following vaccination is a local reaction at the
site of injection. Injection site pain, erythema, or swelling
is reported in 20% to 50% of recipients. These symptoms
are generally mild and self-limited. Mild systemic
complaints (e.g., malaise, fatigue, low grade fever) are
reported in “10% of recipients. No serious adverse
reactions have been reported.
An estimated 1.3 million people have received Havrix”
since it was licensed in Europe and Asia. Serious
conditions for which background incidence data are known
(e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome and brachial plexus
neuropathy), are not more common among vaccine
recipients than among the population. In Europe, the ratio
of reported adverse events to the number of doses
distributed is similar for the manufacturer's hepatitis A
and hepatitis B vaccines.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
Hepatitis A vaccine should not be administered to persons
with a history of a serious allergic reaction to a prior
dose of hepatitis A vaccine, hypersensitivity to alum or, in
the case of Havrix”, to the preservative 2-phenoxyethanol.
Vaccination of persons with moderate or severe acute
illnesses should be deferred until the patient has improved.
The safety of hepatitis A vaccination during pregnancy has
not been determined. However, because it is an
inactivated vaccine, the theoretical risk to the fetus is low.
The risk associated with vaccination should be weighed
against the risk for HAV infection. Because hepatitis A
vaccine is inactivated, no special precautions are needed
when vaccinating immunocompromised persons.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Hepatitis A vaccine should be stored and shipped at
temperatures ranging from 35.6°F (29C) to 46.4°F (8°C)
and should not be frozen. However, the reactogenicity and
immunogenicity are not altered by storage for 1 week at
98.60 F (300C).

Post-Exposure Management with Immune
Globulin
Standard immune globulin (IG; formerly called gamma
globulin) is a concentrated solution of antibodies prepared
from pooled human plasma. In the U.S., only plasma that
has tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen,
antibody to hepatitis C virus, and antibody to human
immunodeficiency virus is used to manufacture IG. The IG
is made with a serial ethanol precipitation procedure that
has been shown to inactivate hepatitis B virus (HBV) and
human immunodeficiency virus.
Serious adverse events from IG are rare. Anaphylaxis has
been reported after repeated administration to persons
who have known IgA deficiency, thus IG should not be
administered to these persons. Pregnancy or lactation is
not a contraindication to IG use.
When administered intramuscularly before exposure to
HAV, or within 2 weeks after exposure, IG is >85% effective
in preventing hepatitis A. Later administration of IG often
only attenuates the clinical expression of HAV infection.
An appropriately large muscle mass (i.e., the deltoid or
gluteal muscle) should be used as the site of the injection.
A single intramuscular dose of 0.02 mL/kg of IG confers
protection for <3 months; 0.06 mL/kg protects for 5
months. IG should be given to exposed persons who have
not previously received hepatitis A vaccine as soon as
possible, but not more than 2 weeks after the exposure.
Recipients may include 1) persons with close contact
(household or sexual) to a person with hepatitis A; 2) staff
and attendees at child care centers where a hepatitis A
case has been recognized; and 3) persons in certain
common-source exposure situations (e.g., to patrons of a
food establishment with an HAV-infected food handler, if
the risk of transmission is determined to be high). Persons
who have received one dose of hepatitis A vaccine at least
1 month before a HAV exposure do not need IG.
IG can interfere with the response to live injected vaccines
(e.g., measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccines). Thus,
administration of live vaccines should be delayed for at least
3 months after administration of IG (see Table 8 of the
General Recommendations on Immunization for more details).
Conversely, unless the benefits of IG prophylaxis exceed the
benefits of vaccination, IG should not be administered for 2
weeks after measle-, mumps-, and rubella-containing
vaccines, and for 3 weeks after vaccination with varicella
vaccine. If IG is given during this period, the person should
be revaccinated with the live vaccine, but not sooner than 3
months after administration of IG.

HEPAT/7/S A
Disease Surveillance and Reporting
Hepatitis A is a reportable disease in all states. Disease
surveillance should be used to 1) monitor disease
incidence in all age groups; 2) determine the epidemiologic
characteristics of infected persons, including the source of
their infection; 3) identify contacts of cases who require
post-exposure prophylaxis; 4) detect outbreaks;
5) determine the effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination;
and 6) determine missed opportunities for vaccination.
Surveillance for hepatitis A is especially important
because determining vaccination strategies to control
ongoing outbreaks depends upon the identification of
specific groups (e.g., by geographic area, age group, or
other characteristics) at increased risk of hepatitis A.
In the United States, case reports of viral hepatitis are
classified as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C/non-A,
non-B hepatitis. Serologic testing is necessary to
determine the etiology of viral hepatitis. Case reports
should be based on laboratory confirmation (see above).
Each state and territory has regulations and/or laws
governing the reporting of diseases and conditions of
public health importance. These regulations/laws list the
diseases and conditions that are to be reported and
describe those persons or groups who are responsible for
reporting, such as health-care providers, hospitals,
laboratories, schools, day care facilities, and other
institutions. Contact your state health department for
reporting requirements in your state.

Hepatitis B
IRAL HEPATITIS IS A TERM COMMONLY USED FOR SEVERAL
clinically similar yet etiologically and
epidemiologically distinct diseases. Hepatitis A
(formerly called infectious hepatitis) and hepatitis B
(formerly called serum hepatitis) have been recognized as
separate entities since the early 1940s and can be
diagnosed with specific serologic tests. Delta hepatitis is
an infection dependent on the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It
may occur as a coinfection with acute HBV infection or as
superinfection of an HBV carrier.
Epidemic jaundice was described by Hippocrates in the
5th century B.C. The first recorded cases of serum
hepatitis, hepatitis B, are thought to be those that
followed the administration of smallpox vaccine
containing human lymph to shipyard workers in Germany
in 1883. In the early and middle parts of this century,
serum hepatitis was repeatedly observed following the
use of contaminated needles and syringes. The role of
blood as a vehicle for virus transmission was further
emphasized in 1943, when Beeson described jaundice
among seven recipients of blood transfusions. Australia
antigen, later called hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg),
was first described in 1965, and the Dane Particle
(complete hepatitis B virion) was identified in 1970.
Identification of serologic markers for HBV infection
followed, which helped clarify the natural history of the
disease. Ultimately, HBs.Ag was prepared in quantity and
now comprises the immunogen in highly effective vaccines
for the prevention of HBV infection.

Hepatitis B Virus
HBV is a small, double-shelled virus in the class
Hepadnaviridae. The virus contains numerous antigenic
components, including HBs.Ag, hepatitis B core antigen
(HBcAg), and hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg). The virus
contains partially double-stranded DNA, and a DNA-
dependent DNA polymerase enzyme. HBV is relatively
resilient and, in some instances, has been shown to remain
infectious on environmental surfaces for at least a month
at room temperature.
HBV infection is an established cause of acute and chronic
hepatitis, cirrhosis, and primary hepatocellular
carcinoma. HBV is the most common cause of chronic
viremia known, with an estimated 200 to 300 million
chronic carriers worldwide. It is second only to tobacco
among known human carcinogens, and is the cause of up to
80% of hepatocellular carcinomas. More than 250,000
persons die worldwide each year of hepatitis B-associated
acute and chronic liver disease.

HB.A.: can be detected in serum after deteroent
(SDS) treatment of the virus core.
Several well-defined antigen-antibody systems are
associated with HBV infection. HBs.Ag, formerly called
Australia antigen or hepatitis-associated antigen, is an
antigenic determinant found on the surface of the virus. It
also makes up subviral 22-nm spherical and tubular
particles. HBs.Ag can be identified in serum 30 to 60 days
after exposure to HBV and persists for variable periods.
HBs.Ag is not infectious. Only the complete virus (Dane
particle) is infectious. However, when HBs.Ag is present in
the blood, complete virus is also present, and the person
may transmit the virus. During replication, HBV produces
HBs.Ag in great excess.



















## p. 225 (#237) ############################################

HEPATITIS B
HBcAg is the nucleocapsid protein core of HBV. HBcAg is
not detectable in serum by conventional techniques, but
can be detected in liver tissue in persons with acute or
chronic HBV infection. HBeAg, a soluble protein, is also
contained in the core of HBV. HBeAg is detected in the
serum of persons with high virus titers and indicates high
infectivity. Antibody to HBs.Ag (Anti-HBs) develops
during convalescence after acute HBV infection or
following hepatitis B vaccination. The presence of HBSAb
antibody indicates immunity to HBV. Antibody to HBCAg
(Anti-HBc) indicates infection with HBV at an undefined
time in the past. IgM class antibody to HBcAg (IgM
anti-HBc) indicates recent infection with HBV. Antibody
to HBeAg (Anti-HBe) becomes detectable when HBeAg is
lost and is associated with low infectivity of serum.
Clinical Features

The clinical course of acute hepatitis B is
indistinguishable from that of other types of acute viral
hepatitis. The incubation period ranges from 45 to 160
days (average, 120 days). Clinical signs and symptoms
occur more often in adults than in infants or children, who
usually have an asymptomatic acute course. However,
approximately 50% of adults who have acute infections are
asymptomatic. When symptoms occur in acute HBV
infection, they may occur in the following patterns.
The preicteric, or prodromal, phase from initial
symptoms to onset of jaundice, usually lasts from 3 to 10
days. It is characterized by insidious onset with malaise,
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant
abdominal pain, fever, headache, myalgias, skin rashes,
arthralgias and arthritis, and dark urine, beginning 1 to 2
days before the onset of jaundice. The icteric phase is
variable, but usually lasts from 1 to 3 weeks, characterized
by jaundice, light or gray stools, hepatic tenderness and
hepatomegaly (splenomegaly is less common). During
convalescence, malaise and fatigue may persist for
weeks or months, while jaundice, anorexia, and other
symptoms disappear.
Most acute HBV infections in adults result in complete
recovery with elimination of HBs.Ag from the blood and
the production of anti-HBs creating immunity from future
infection.

Complications
While most acute HBV infections in adults result in
Hepatitis B Complications complete recovery, fulminant hepatitis occurs in about 1%
to 2% of persons, with mortality rates of 63% to 93%. About
• Fulminant hepatitis 200 to 300 Americans die of fulminant disease each year.
• Hospitalization Although the consequences of acute HBV infection can be
• Cirrhosis - severe, most of the serious complications associated with

Chronic HBV infection
Approximately 10% of all acute HBV infections progress
to chronic infection, with the risk of chronic HBV
infection decreasing with age. As many as 90% of infants
who acquire HBV infection from their mothers at birth
become carriers. Of children who become infected with
HBV between 1 year and 5 years of age, 30% to 50%
become carriers. By adulthood, the risk of becoming a
carrier is 6% to 10%.

Persons with chronic infection are often asymptomatic
and may not be aware that they are infected, yet are
capable of infecting others. Chronic infection is
responsibile for most HBV-related morbidity and
mortality, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver
failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic active
hepatitis develops in over 25% of carriers, and often
results in cirrhosis. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 persons
die of hepatitis B-related cirrhosis each year in the United
States. Persons with chronic HBV infection are at 12 to

ºzo Laboratory Diagnosis
, º,
ºffin-Hºmo-rºma 14 yrs. Bºyrs
Age atlinfection Diagnosis is based on clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic
findings. HBV infection cannot be differentiated on the
basis of clinical symptoms alone, and definitive diagnosis
depends on the results of serologic testing. Serologic
markers of HBV infection vary depending on whether the
infection is acute or chronic.
HBs.Ag is the most commonly used test for diagnosing
acute HBV infections or detecting carriers. HBs.Ag can be
detected as early as 1 or 2 weeks and as late as 11 or 12
weeks after exposure to HBV when sensitive assays are
used. The presence of HBs.Ag indicates that a person is
infectious, regardless of whether the infection is acute or
chronic.

HEPATITIS B
Anti-HBc (core antibody) develops in all HBV infections,
appears shortly after HBSAg in acute disease, and
indicates HBV infection at some undefined time in the
past. Anti-HBc only occurs after HBV infection, and does
not develop in persons whose immunity to HBV is from
vaccine. Anti-HBc generally persists for life and is not a
serologic marker for acute infection.
IgM anti-HBc appears in persons with acute disease
about the time of illness onset and indicates recent
infection with HBV. IgM anti-HBc is generally detectable
4 to 6 months after onset of illness and is the best
serologic marker of acute HBV infection. A negative test
for IgM-anti-HBc together with a positive test for HBs.Ag
in a single blood sample identifies a chronic HBV
infection.
HBeAg is a useful marker associated strongly with the
number of infective HBV particles in the serum and a
higher risk of infectivity.
Anti-HBs (surface antibody) is a protective, neutralizing
antibody. The presence of anti-HBs following acute HBV
infection generally indicates recovery and immunity from
reinfection. Anti-HBs can also be acquired as an immune
response to hepatitis B vaccine or passively transferred by
administration of HBIG. Using radioimmunoassay (RIA),
a minimum of 10 sample ratio units should be used to
designate immunity. Using enzyme immunoassay (EIA),
the manufacturer's recommended positive should be
considered an appropriate measure of immunity. The
level of anti-HBs may also be expressed in milli-
International Units/mL (mLU/mL). Ten mIU/mL is
considered to indicate a protective level of immunity.
Medical Management
There is no specific therapy for acute HBV infection. Alpha
interferon is the most effective treatment for chronic HBV
infection and is successful 25% to 50% of the time.
Persons with acute HBV infections and carriers should
prevent their blood and other potentially infective body
fluids from contacting other persons. They should not
donate blood, or share eating utensils, toothbrushes, or
razors with household members.
In the hospital setting, patients with HBV infection
should be managed with Blood/Body Fluid Precautions
(See CDC Guideline for Isolation Precautions in
Hospitals). Health care workers should employ universal
precautions for all patients, regardless of their bloodborne
infection status.

• Communicability 1-2 months before and

Chronic carriers Transmission
The virus is transmitted by parenteral or mucosal
exposure to HBs.Ag-positive body fluids from persons
who are carriers or have acute HBV infection. The highest
concentrations of virus are in blood and serous fluids;
lower titers are found in other fluids, such as saliva and
semen. Saliva can be a vehicle of transmission through
bites; however, other types of exposure to saliva, including
kissing, are unlikely modes of transmission. There
appears to be no transmission of HBV via tears, sweat,
urine, stool, or droplet nuclei.
In the United States, the most important route of
transmission is by sexual contact, either heterosexual or
homosexual, with an infected person. Fecal-oral
transmission does not appear to occur. However,
transmission among homosexual men occurs possibly via
contamination from asymptomatic rectal mucosal lesions.
Direct percutaneous inoculation of HBV by needles
during injection drug use is an important mode of
transmission. Transmission of HBV may also occur by
other percutaneous exposure, including tattooing, ear
piercing, and acupuncture, as well as needle-sticks or
other injuries from sharp instruments sustained by
medical personnel. These exposures account for only a
small proportion of reported cases in the United States.
Breaks in the skin without overt needle puncture, such as
fresh cutaneous scratches, abrasions, burns, or other
lesions, may also serve as routes for entry.
Contamination of mucosal surfaces with infective
serum or plasma may occur in mouth pipetting accidents,
accidental eye splash, or other direct contact with mucous
membranes of the eyes or mouth, such as hand-to-mouth
or hand-to-eye when contaminated with infective blood or
serum. Transfer of infective material to skin lesions or
mucous membranes via inanimate environmental surfaces
may occur by touching surfaces of various types of hospital
equipment. Contamination of mucosal surfaces with
infective secretions other than serum or plasma could
occur with contact involving semen.

Perinatal transmission from mother to infant at birth is
very efficient. If the mother is positive for both HBs.Ag
and HBeAg, 70%-90% of infants will become infected. The
risk of perinatal transmission drops to 20% if the mother
is positive only for HBs.Ag. Up to 90% of these infected
infants will become HBV carriers. An estimated 25% of
these carriers will ultimately die of liver failure secondary
to chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or primary
hepatocellular carcinoma.
The frequency of infection and patterns of transmission
vary in different parts of the world. Approximately 45% of
the global population live in areas with a high prevalence
of chronic HBV infection (8% of the population is HBs.Ag-
positive); 43% in areas with a moderate prevalence (2% to
7% of the population is HBs.Ag-positive); and 12% in areas
with a low prevalence (<2% of the population is HBs.Ag-
positive).
\
In China, Southeast Asia, most of Africa, most Pacific
Islands, parts of the Middle East, and the Amazon Basin,
8% to 15% of the population carry the virus. The lifetime
risk of HBV infection is >60%, and most infections are
acquired at birth or during early childhood, when the risk
of developing chronic infections is greatest. In these areas,
because most infections are asymptomatic, very little acute
disease related to HBV occurs, but rates of chronic liver
disease and liver cancer in adults are very high.
In the United States, Western Europe, and Australia, HBV
infection is a disease of low endemicity. Infection occurs
primarily during adulthood, and only 0.1% to 0.5% of the
population are chronic carriers.
Communicability
Persons with either acute or chronic HBV infection should
be considered infectious any time that HBs.Ag is present
in the blood. When symptoms are present in persons with
acute HBV infection, HBs.Ag can be found in the blood and
body fluids of infected persons for 1 to 2 months before
and after the onset of symptoms.

Hepatitis B Prevention Strategies
Hepatitis B vaccines have been available in the United
States since 1981. However, the impact of vaccine on HBV
disease has been less than optimal, and the incidence of
reported hepatitis B cases is now only slightly less than as
it was before the vaccine was licensed.
The apparent lack of impact from the vaccine can be
attributed to several factors. From 1981 until 1991,
vaccination was targeted to people in groups at high risk
of HBV infection. A large proportion of persons with HBV
infection (25% to 30%) deny any risk factors for the
disease. These persons would not be identified by a
targeted risk factor screening approach.
The three major risk groups (heterosexuals with contact
with infected persons or multiple partners, injection drug
users, and homosexually active males), are not reached
effectively by targeted programs. Deterrents to
immunization of these groups include lack of awareness of
the risk of disease and its consequences, lack of effective
public or private sector programs, and vaccine cost.
Difficulty in gaining access to these populations is also a
problem. Further, there has been limited success in
providing vaccine to persons in high-risk groups due to
rapid acquisition of infection after beginning high-risk
behaviors, low initial vaccine acceptance, and low
completion rates.
Obstacles to Targeting High-Risk Groups
• No identified risk factor in 25%-30% of adults with acute
hepatitis B
• Limited access to persons in some high-risk groups
- difficult to identify as belonging to a risk group
- less likely to receive preventive care
• Limited success in providing vaccine to persons in
some high-riskgroups
- rapidly infected after beginning high-risk behaviors
- low initial vaccine acceptance
- low completion rates

Hepatitis B Vaccine

• Efficacy 95% (Range, 80%-100%)
• Duration of
Immunity >11 years
• Schedule 3 Doses
• Booster doses not routinely recommended
A comprehensive hepatitis B prevention strategy was
recommended in 1991, and includes (a) prenatal testing of
pregnant women for HBs.Ag to identify newborns who
require immunoprophylaxis for the prevention of
perinatal infection and to identify household contacts who
should be vaccinated, (b) routine vaccination of infants, (c)
vaccination of certain adolescents, and (d) vaccination of
adults at high risk of infection.
Hepatitis B Vaccine
Characteristics
A plasma-derived vaccine was licensed in the United
States in 1981. It was produced from 22nm. HBs.Ag
particles purified from the plasma of human carriers. The
vaccine was safe and effective, but was not well accepted,
possibly because of unbased fears of transmission of live
HBV and other blood-borne pathogens (e.g., human
immunodeficiency virus). This vaccine was removed from
the U.S. market in 1992.
Recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the
United States in July 1986, and was the first vaccine
licensed in the United States produced by recombinant
DNA technology. A second, similar vaccine was licensed in
August 1989.
Recombinant vaccine is produced by inserting a plasmid
containing the gene for HBSAg into common baker's yeast
(Saccharomyces cerevisioe). Yeast cells then produce
HBs.Ag, which is harvested and purified. The recombinant
vaccine contains over 95% HBs.Ag protein (5 to 40 mcg/ml);
yeast-derived proteins may constitute up to 5% of the final
product, but no yeast DNA is detectable in the vaccine.
HBV infection cannot result from use of the recombinant
vaccine, since no potentially infectious viral DNA or
complete viral particles are produced in the recombinant
system. Vaccine HBs.Ag is adsorbed to aluminum
hydroxide, and thimerosal is added as a preservative.
Hepatitis B vaccine is produced by two manufacturers in
the United States - Merck and Company (Recombivax HB)
and SmithKline Beecham (Engerix-B). Both vaccines are
available in both pediatric and adult formulations.
Although the antigen content of the vaccines differ (see
table below and in Appendix A), vaccines made by
different manufacturers are interchangeable.
Providers must always follow the manufacturer's dosage
recommendations.








## p. 233 (#245) ############################################

HEPATITIS B
Both the pediatric and adult formulations of Recombivax
HB are approved for use in any age group. For example,
the adult formulation of Recombivax HB may be used in
children (0.5 ml) and adolescents (0.5 ml). However,
pediatric Engerix-B is approved for use only in children
and adolescents <20 years of age. The adult formulation of
Engerix-B is not approved for use in infants and children,
but may be used in both adolescents (11-19 years of age)
and adults (see table below and in Appendix A).
Immunogenicityand vaccine efficacy
After three intramuscular doses of hepatitis B vaccine,
over 90% of healthy adults and over 95% of infants,
children, and adolescents (from birth to 19 years of age)
develop adequate antibody responses. However, there is
an age-specific decline in immunogenicity. After age 40
years, approximately 90% of recepients respond to a 3-
dose series, and by 60 years, only 75% of vaccinees develop
protective antibody titiers.
The vaccine is 80% to 100% effective in preventing infection
or clinical hepatitis in those who receive the complete
course of vaccine. Larger vaccine doses (2 to 4 times the
normal adult dose) or an increased number of doses are
required to induce protective antibody in a high proportion
of hemodialysis patients and may also be necessary in other
immunocompromised persons.
The recommended dosage of vaccine differs depending on
the age of the recipient, certain exposure circumstances
(e.g., perinatal), and type of vaccine (see table).
Hemodialysis patients should receive a 40 mcg dose in a
series of three or four doses. Recombivax HB has a
special dialysis patient formulation that contains 40 mcg/
ml.

The deltoid muscle is the recommended site for
hepatitis B vaccination in adults and children, while the
anterolateral thigh is recommended for infants and
neonates. Immunogenicity of vaccine in adults is lower
when injections are given in the buttock.
Available data show that vaccine-induced antibody levels
decline with time. Nevertheless, immune memory
remains intact for >13 years following immunization, and
both adults and children with declining antibody levels
are still protected against significant HBV infection (i.e.,
clinical disease, HBs.Ag antigenenia, or significant
elevation of liver enzymes). Exposure to HBV results in
an anamnestic anti-HBs response that prevents clinically
significant HBV infection. Chronic HBV infection has
only rarely been documented among vaccine responders.
For adults and children with normal immune status,
booster doses of vaccine are not recommended, nor is
routine serologic testing to assess immune status of
vaccinees indicated. The need for booster doses after
longer intervals will continue to be assessed as additional
information becomes available.
For hemodialysis patients, the need for booster doses
should be assessed by annual testing of vaccinees for
antibody levels, and booster doses should be provided
when antibody levels decline below 10 mTU/ml.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Infants and children
Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all infants,
and should be incorporated into the infant's routine
vaccination schedule. Infants and children -11 years of
age should receive 0.5 ml (5 meg) of pediatric or adult
formulation Recombivax HB (Merck) or 0.5 ml (10 mcg) of
pediatric Engerix-B (SmithKline Beecham). Primary
vaccination consists of three intramuscular doses of
vaccine with the second and third doses given 1 to 3 and 2
to 17 months, respectively, after the first. The first dose
can be administered during the newborn period,
preferably before the infant is discharged from the
hospital, but no later than when the infant is 2 months of
age.
Because the highest titers of anti-HBs are achieved when
the last two doses of vaccine are spaced at least 4 months
apart, schedules that achieve this spacing are preferable.
However, schedules with 2-month intervals between
doses, which conform to schedules for other childhood
vaccines, have been shown to produce good antibody

responses and may be appropriate in populations in which
it is difficult to ensure that infants will be brought back
for all their vaccinations. However, the third dose must
be administered at least 2 months after the second dose,
and should follow the first dose by at least 4 months. The
third dose should not be given prior to 6 months of
age. It is not necessary to add doses or restart the series
if the interval between doses is longer than recommended.
Doses given at less than the minimum intervals or
age should not be counted as part of the vaccination
Ser1eS.
Premature infants born to HBs.Ag-positive mothers
should receive immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B
vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG)
beginning at or shortly after birth (see details below). For
premature infants of HBs.Ag-negative mothers, the
optimal timing of hepatitis B vaccination has not been
determined. Some studies suggest that decreased
seroconversion rates might occur in some premature
infants with low birthweights (i.e., *2000 grams) following
administration of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Routine
hepatitis vaccination is not recommended for these
infants. Low birthweight infants of HBs.Ag-negative
mothers may begin the hepatitis B vaccine series at
discharge from the nursery, if the infant weighs at least
2000 grams, along with DTaP, IPV, and Hib vaccines.
When hepatitis B vaccine is used, the full recommended
dose should be used. Divided or reduced doses are not
recommended.
In October 1996, a combination hepatitis B and
Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine was
licensed (COMVAX, Merck). Each dose of COMVAX
contains 7.5 micrograms of PRP-OMP Hib vaccine
(PedvaxHIB), and 5 micrograms of hepatitis B surface
antigen. The dose of hepatitis B surface antigen is the
same as that contained in Merck's pediatric formulation.
The immunogenicity of the combination vaccine is
equivalent to that of the individual antigens administered
at separate sites. Adverse reactions following the
combination vaccine are uncommon, as they are following
vaccination with the individual antigens.
COMVAX is licensed for use at 2, 4, and 12-15 months of
age. It may be used whenever both antigens are indicated.
However, the vaccine must not be administered to
infants younger than 6 weeks of age because of potential
suppression of the immune response to the Hib component
(see Hib chapter for more details). COMVAX must not be
used for doses at birth or one month of age for a child
on a 0-1-6 month hepatitis B vaccine schedule.

Adults who are at increased risk of HBV infection from
sexual transmission include men who have sex with
other men, heterosexuals with multiple sexual
partners, persons diagnosed with a recently acquired
sexually transmitted disease, and prostitutes.
Injection drug users who share needles are at extremely
high-risk for HBV infection. All injection drug users who
are susceptible to HBV should be vaccinated as soon as
possible after their drug use begins.
Long-term male prison inmates are at increased risk of
HBV infection because of injection drug use, homosexual
activity, or other factors. The prison setting provides an
access point for vaccination of inmates with histories of
high-risk behavior.
Persons on hemodialysis are at increased risk of HBV
infection because of contact with large amounts of blood.
Although the hepatitis B vaccine is less effective in these
patients, it is recommended for all susceptible
hemodialysis patients.
The risk of health care workers contracting HBV
infection depends on how often they are exposed to blood or
blood products through percutaneous and permucosal
exposures. Any health care or public safety worker may be
at risk for HBV exposure, depending on the tasks
performed. If those tasks involve contact with blood or
blood-contaminated body fluids, then such workers should
be vaccinated. Risk is often highest during training
periods. Therefore, it is recommended that vaccination be
completed during training in schools of medicine, dentistry,
nursing, laboratory technology, and other allied health
professions.
Other groups who may be candidates for hepatitis B
vaccine
The special behavioral and medical problems encountered
in institutions for the developmentally disabled make
this a high-risk setting, and clients and staff should be
vaccinated. The risk of HBV infection in these
institutions is related to contact with blood and also with

that contain HBV. Clients and staff of group and foster

In certain U.S. populations, such as Alaskan Natives,
Pacific Islanders, and immigrants and refugees from
HBV endemic areas, HBV infection is highly endemic
and transmission occurs primarily during childhood. In
such groups, vaccination of all infants is particularly
important. Immigrants and refugees from areas with
highly endemic HBV disease should be screened for HBV
upon resettlement in the U.S. If a carrier is identified, all
susceptible household members should be vaccinated.
Even if no carriers are found, vaccination is recommended
for susceptible children less than 7 years of age because of
the high rate of interfamilial spread of HBV.
Adoptees, orphans and unaccompanied minors from
countries of high or intermediate HBV endemicity
should be screened for HBs.Ag, and, if positive, their
household members should be vaccinated.
Household members and sex partners of HBV
carriers should be tested and, if susceptible, should be
vaccinated.
Adults and children who plan to travel to areas
outside the United States that have high rates of HBV
infection should be vaccinated if they plan to stay in these
areas for more than 6 months and have close contact with
the local population. Persons traveling for shorter
durations who may have sexual contact with local persons
in areas where HBV infection is common should also be
vaccinated. Persons traveling abroad who will perform
medical procedures in areas where HBV infection is
common are at very high risk.
Recipients of certain blood products, such as those
with hemophilia, are at high risk of infection. Vaccination
should be initiated at the time their specific clotting
disorder is identified.
Persons who have casual contact with carriers at schools
and offices are at little risk of catching HBV infection, and
vaccine is not recommended for them. Unless special
circumstances exist, such as behavior problems (biting or
scratching) or medical conditions (severe skin disease)
that might facilitate transmission, vaccination of contacts
of carriers in child care centers is not indicated.

HEPATITIS B
Serologic Testing of Vaccine Recipients
Prevaccination serologic testing
The decision to screen potential vaccine recipients for
prior infection depends on the cost of vaccination, the cost
of testing for susceptibility, and the expected prevalence
of immune persons in the group. Screening is usually
cost-effective, and should be considered, in groups with a
high risk of HBV infection (HBV markers prevalence
>20%) such as male homosexuals, injection drug users,
Alaskan natives, Pacific Islanders, children of immigrants
from endemic countries, and family members of HBs.Ag
carriers. Screening is usually not cost-effective for groups
with a low expected prevalence of HBV serologic markers
such as health professionals in their training years.
Serologic testing is not recommended before routine
vaccination of infants and children.
Post-vaccination serologic testing
Testing for immunity following vaccination is not
recommended routinely, but should be considered for
persons whose subsequent management depends on
knowing their immune status, such as dialysis patients
and staff, and persons in whom a suboptimal response may
be anticipated, such as those who have received vaccine in
the buttock. When necessary, post-vaccination testing
should be done between 1-2 months after completion of
the vaccine series to provide definitive information on
response to the vaccine.
All infants born to HBs.Ag-positive women should be
tested 3-9 months after their third dose of hepatitis B
vaccine (i.e., at 9-15 months of age). If HBs.Ag is not
present and anti-HBs antibody is present, children can be
considered to be protected.
In December 1997, ACIP and the Hospital Infection
Control Practices Advisory Committee published new,
comprehensive recommendations for the immunization of
health care workers. One of the new recommendations
was that health care workers who have contact with
patients or blood and are at ongoing risk for injuries
with sharp instruments or needlesticks should be
routinely tested for antibody after vaccination.
However, a catch-up program of serologic testing for
health care providers vaccinated prior to December 1997
is not recommended. These individuals should be tested
as necessary if they have a significant exposure to HBV
(see postexposure prophylaxis section below).

Management of Nonresponders
• Revaccination with one or more additional
doses should be considered
-15%-25% respond after one
additional dose
.30%-50% respond after three
additional doses -
Routine postvaccination testing is not recommended for
persons at low risk of exposure, such as public safety
workers and health care workers without direct patient
Contact.
Vaccine nonresponders
A number of factors have been associated with
nonresponse to hepatitis B vaccine. These include vaccine
factors (e.g., dose, schedule, injection site), and host
factors. Older age (>40 years), male gender, obesity,
smoking, and chronic illness have been independently
associated with nonresponse to hepatitis B vaccine.
Further vaccination of nonresponders to a primary
vaccination series administered in the deltoid muscle
produces adequate response in 15% to 25% after one
additional dose and in 30% to 50% after three additional
doses. For persons who did not respond to a primary
vaccination series given in the buttock, data suggest that
revaccination in the arm induces adequate antibody in
>75%. Revaccination with one or more additional doses
should be considered for persons who fail to respond to
vaccination in the deltoid, and is recommended for those
who have failed to respond to vaccination in the buttock.
Health care workers who do not respond to the first series
of hepatitis B vaccine should complete a second three-
dose vaccine series or be evaluated to determine if they
are HBs.Ag-positive. The second vaccine series should be
given on the usual 0, 1, 6-month schedule. A 0, 1, 4-month
accelerated schedule may also be used. Revaccinated
persons should be retested at the completion of the second
vaccine series. Persons who are found to be HBs.Ag-
positive (i.e., acutely or chronically infected with HBV)
should be counseled accordingly. Vaccine nonresponders
who are HBs.Ag-negative should be considered susceptible
to HBV infection and should be counseled regarding
precautions to prevent HBV infection and the need to
obtain HBIG prophylaxis for any known or probable
parenteral exposure to HBs.Ag-positive blood (see table).
Post-Exposure Management
Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended as part of the
therapy used to prevent hepatitis B infection following
exposure to HBV. The hepatitis B vaccine series should
be started at the same time as other therapy, primarily
treatment with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG).
Infants born to women who are HBs.Ag-positive (i.e.,
acutely or chronically infected with HBV) are at
extremely high risk of HBV transmission and chronic
HBV infection. Hepatitis B vaccination and one dose of
HBIG administered within 24 hours after birth are 85%-
95% effective in preventing both HBV infection and

chronic infection. Hepatitis B vaccine administered alone
beginning within 24 hours after birth is 70%-95% effective
in preventing perinatal HBV infection.
HBIG (0.5 ml) should be given IM, preferably within
12 hours of birth. Hepatitis B vaccine should be given IM
in three doses. The first dose should be given at the same
time as HBIG, but at a different site. If vaccine is not
immediately available, the first injection should be given
within 7 days of birth. The second and third doses should
be given 1-2 months and 6 months, respectively, after the
first. Testing for HBs.Ag and anti-HBs is recommended at
9 to 15 months of age (or 3 to 9 months after the third
dose) to monitor the success of therapy. If the mother's
HBs.Ag status is not known at the time of birth, the infant
should be vaccinated within 12 hours of birth.
HBIG given at birth does not interfere with the
administration of oral polio vaccine and diphtheria-
tetanus-pertussis vaccines administered at 2 months of
age. Subsequent doses of hepatitis B vaccine do not
interfere with the routine pediatric vaccine schedule.
There are few data available on the use of COMVAX in
infants born to women who have acute or chronic infection
with hepatitis B virus (i.e., HbsAg-positive). COMVAX is
not currently licensed for infants whose mothers are
known to be acutely or chronically infected with HBV.
COMVAX should never be used in infants <6 weeks of
age. COMVAX may be administered at the same time as
other childhood vaccines given at >6 weeks of age.
Persons with inadvertant exposure to HBs.Ag-
positive blood where there is entry through the skin or a
mucous membrane should be tested for HBs.Ag and HIV
antibody. In response to the Health Omnibus Programs
Extension Act of 1988, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration has issued guidelines which state that,
after identification and consent is obtained from the
individual from whom exposure occurred, a blood sample
should be drawn and tested for HBs.Ag and HIV antibody.
Management of exposed individuals should take into
account (1) HBV vaccination and vaccine response status
of the exposed person, (2) whether the source of blood is
available, and (3) the HBs.Ag status of the source (see
table).
Prevention of Perinatal Hepatitis B
Virus Infections
• Begin treatment within 12 hours of birth
• Hepatitis B vaccine (first dose) and
hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) at
different sites
• Complete vaccination schedule at 1-2
and 6 months of age
• Test for response after third dose

A single dose of HBIG (0.06ml/kg), given within 14 days of

begin the hepatitis B vaccine series, if prophylaxis can be
started within 14 days of the last sexual contact or if
ongoing sexual contact will occur. Alternatively, for
persons who are not members of a high-risk group, one
dose of HBIG can be given and the partner retested for
HBs.Ag 3 months later. If still positive, then a second dose
of HBIG should be given and the vaccine series initiated.
Household contacts of persons with acute HBV
infection
Since infants have close contact with primary caregivers
and they have a higher risk of becoming carriers,
prophylaxis with HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine for infants
less than 12 months old is indicated if the mother or
primary caregiver has acute HBV infection. Prophylaxis
for other household contacts is not indicated unless they
have identifiable blood exposure such as sharing
toothbrushes or razors. These exposures should be treated
similarly to sexual exposures. If the index patient becomes
a carrier, all household members should be immunized.

HEPATITIS B
Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
The most common adverse reaction following hepatitis B
vaccine is pain at the site of injection, reported in 13%
to 29% of adults and 3% to 9% of children. Mild systemic
complaints, such as fatigue, headache, and irritability
have been reported in 11% to 17% of adults and 0% to 20%
of children. Low-grade fever (>37.7°C) has been reported
in 1% of adults and 0.4% to 6.4% of children. Serious
systemic adverse events and allergic reactions are rarely
reported following hepatitis B vaccine.
Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
A serious allergic reaction to a prior dose of hepatitis
B vaccine or a vaccine component is a contraindication to
further doses of vaccine. Such allergic reactions are rare.
Persons with moderate to severe acute illness should
not be vaccinated until their conditions improve.
However, minor illnesses, such as upper respiratory
infections, are not a contraindication to vaccination.
No information is available about the safety of the vaccine in
pregnant women. However, because the vaccine contains only
particles that do not cause HBV infection, there should be no
risk. In contrast, if a pregnant woman acquires HBV infection,
it may cause severe disease in the mother and chronic infection
in the newborn baby. Therefore, pregnant women who are
otherwise eligible can be given hepatitis B vaccine.
Hepatitis B vaccine does not contain live virus, so it may be
used in persons with immunodeficiency. However,
response to vaccination in such persons may be suboptimal.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Hepatitis B vaccines should be stored refrigerated at 2°-
8°C (35°-46°F), but not frozen. Freezing destroys the
potency of the vaccine.
Hepatitis B Immune Globulin
Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) is prepared by cold
ethanol fraction of plasma from selected donors with high
anti-HBs titers; contains an anti-HBs titer of at least
1:100,000, by RIA. It is used for passive immunization for
(1) accidental (percutaneous, mucous membrane)
exposure, (2) sexual exposure to HBs.Ag-positive person,
(3) perinatal exposure of infant, or (4) household exposure
of an infant less than 12 months old to a primary caregiver
with acute hepatitis B.

All candidates for HBIG are, by definition, in a high-risk
category, and should therefore be considered for vaccine
as well.
Immune globulin (IG) is prepared by cold ethanol
fractionation of pooled plasma and contains low titers of
anti-HBs. Because titers are relatively low, IG has no
valid current use for HBV disease, unless hepatitis B
immune globulin is unavailable.

evaluated for the need for hepatitis B vaccine.

Influenzo
NFLUENZA IS A HIGHLY INFECTIOUS VIRAL ILLNESS. THE NAME,
“influenza,” originated in 15th century Italy, from an
epidemic attributed to “influence of the stars.” The
first pandemic, or world-wide epidemic, that clearly fits
the description of influenza was in 1580. At least four
pandemics of influenza occurred in the 19th century, and 3
have occured in the 20th century. The pandemic of
“Spanish flu" in 1918-1919 caused an estimated 21 million
deaths worldwide.
Smith, Andrews, and Laidlaw isolated influenza A virus in
ferrets in 1933, and Francis isolated influenza B virus in
1936. In 1940 Burnet discovered that influenza virus
could be grown in embryonated hens' eggs. This led to the
study of the characteristics of the virus and the
development of inactivated vaccines. Evidence of the
protective efficacy of inactivated vaccines was produced
in the 1950s.
Influenza Virus
Influenza is a single-stranded, helically shaped, RNA
virus of the orthomyxovirus family. Basic antigen types A,
B, and C are determined by the nuclear material. Type A
influenza has subtypes that are determined by the surface
antigens hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N).
Three types of hemagglutinin in humans (H1, H2, and H3)
have a role in virus attachment to cells. Two types of
neuraminidase (N1 and N2) have a role in virus
penetration into cells.
Influenza A causes moderate to severe illness, and
affects all age groups. The virus infects humans and other
animals, such as pigs and birds.

was dominant
-AISydney/5/97 (H3N2) appeared in late
1997 and became the dominant virus
In 1998
Influenza B generally causes milder disease than type A,
and primarily affects children. Influenza B is more stable
than influenza A, with less antigenic drift and consequent
immunologic stability. It affects only humans. It may be
associated with Reye syndrome.
Influenza C is rarely reported as a cause of human
illness, probably because most cases are subclinical. It has
not been associated with epidemic disease.
The nomenclature to describe the type of influenza virus
is expressed in this order: (1) virus type, (2) geographic
site where it was first isolated, (3) strain number, (4) year
of isolation, and (5) virus subtype.
Antigenic changes
Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase periodically change,
apparently due to sequential evolution within immune or
partially immune populations. Antigenic mutants emerge
and are selected as the predominant virus to the extent
that they differ from the antecedent virus, which is
suppressed by specific antibody arising in the population.
This cycle repeats continuously. In interpandemic
periods, mutants arise by serial point mutations in the
RNA coding for hemagglutinin. At irregular intervals of
10 to 40 years, viruses showing major antigenic differences
from prevalent subtypes appear and, because the
population does not have protective antibody against
these new antigens, cause pandemic disease in all age
groups.
Antigenic shift is a major change in one or both surface
antigens (H and/or N) that occurs at varying intervals.
Antigenic shifts are probably due to genetic recombination
between influenza A viruses, usually those that affect
humans and birds. An antigenic shift may result in a
worldwide pandemic if the virus is efficiently transmitted
from person to person. The last major antigenic shift
occurred in 1968 when H3N2 (Hong Kong) influenza
suddenly appeared. It completely replaced the type A
strain (H2N2, or Asian influenza) that had circulated
throughout the world for the prior 10 years.
Antigenic drift is a minor change in surface antigens that
occurs between major shifts. Antigenic drift may result in
epidemics, since incomplete protection remains from past
exposures to similar viruses. Drift occurs in all three
types of influenza virus (A,B,C). For instance, during most
of the 1997-1998 influenza season, A/Wuhan/359/95 (H3N2)
was the predominant influenza strain isolated in the
United States. A/Wuhan was a drifted distant relative of
the 1968 Hong Kong H3N2 strain. In the last half of the
1997-1998 influenza season, a drifted variant of A/Wuhan



## p. 249 (#261) ############################################

IWFLUENZA
appeared. This virus, named A/Sydney/5/97, was different
enough from A/Wuhan (which had been included in the
1997-1998 vaccine) that the vaccine didn't provide much
protection. Both A/Wuhan and A/Sydney circulated late in
the 1997-1998 influenza season. A/Sydney became the
predominant strain during the 1998-1999 influenza season,
and was included in the 1998-1999 vaccine.
In the past 100 years, there have been 4 antigenic shifts
that led to major pandemics (1889-1891, 1918-1920, 1957-
1958, and 1968-1969). A pandemic starts from a single
focus and spreads along routes of travel. Typically, there
are high attack rates involving all age groups and
mortality is usually markedly increased. Severity is
generally not greater in the individual (except for the
1918-1919 strain), but because large numbers of people are
infected, the number, if not the proportion, of severe and
fatal cases will be large. Onset may occur in any season of
the year. Secondary and tertiary waves may occur over a
period of 1-2 years, usually in the winter.
Typically in epidemics, influenza attack rates are lower
than in pandemics. There is usually a rise in excess
mortality. The major impact is observed in morbidity, with
high attack rates and excess rates of hospitalization,
especially for adults with respiratory disease.
Absenteeism from work and school is high, with an
increase in visits to health care providers. In the
Northern Hemisphere, epidemics usually occur in late fall
and continue through early spring. In the Southern
Hemisphere, epidemics usually occur 6 months before or
after those in the Northern Hemisphere.
Sporadic outbreaks can occasionally localize to families,
schools, and isolated communities.
Pathogenesis
Following respiratory transmission, the virus attaches to
and penetrates respiratory epithelial cells in the trachea
and bronchi. Viral replication occurs, which results in the
destruction of the host cell. Viremia does not occur. Virus
is shed in respiratory secretions for 5 to 10 days.
Clinical Features
The incubation period for influenza is usually 2 days, but
can vary from 1 to 5 days. The severity of influenza illness
depends on the prior immunologic experience with
antigenically related virus variants. In general, only
around 50% of infected persons will develop the classic
clinical symptoms of influenza.

years of age or older
“Classic” influenza disease is characterized by the abrupt
onset of fever, myalgia, sore throat, and nonproductive
cough. The fever is usually 101°-102°F, and accompanied
by prostration. The onset of fever is often so abrupt that
the exact hour is recalled by the patient. Myalgias mainly
affect the back muscles. Cough is believed to be a result of
tracheal epithelial destruction. Additional symptoms may
include rhinorrhea (runny nose), headache, substernal
chest burning and ocular symptoms (e.g., eye pain and
sensitivity to light).
Systemic symptoms and temperature usually last from 2 to
3 days, rarely more than 5 days. They may be decreased by
such medications as aspirin or acetaminophen. Aspirin
should not be used for infants, children, or teenagers,
because they may be at risk for contracting Reye syndrome
following an influenza infection. Recovery is usually rapid,
but some may have lingering depression and asthenia (lack
of strength or energy) for several weeks.
Complications
The most frequent complication of influenza is pneumonia,
most commonly secondary bacterial pneumonia
(e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,
or Staphylococcus aureus). Primary influenza viral
pneumonia is an uncommon complication with a high
fatality rate. Reye syndrome is a complication that
occurs almost exclusively in children, primarily in
association with influenza B (or varicella zoster), and
presents with severe vomiting and confusion which may
progress to coma, due to swelling of the brain.
Other complications include myocarditis (inflammation
of the heart), and worsening of chronic bronchitis and
other chronic pulmonary diseases. Death is reported in
0.5-1 per 1000 cases. The majority of deaths occur in
persons ~65 years of age.

An increase in mortality typically accompanies an
influenza epidemic. Increased mortality results not only
from influenza and pneumonia, but also from
cardiopulmonary and other chronic diseases that can be
exacerbated by influenza.
In studies of influenza epidemics occurring from 1972
through 1995 (years with only antigenic drift), excess deaths
associated with influenza occurred during 19 of 23 influenza
epidemics. An estimated 20,000 or more influenza-associated
deaths occurred during five of these epidemics, and over
40,000 deaths occurred during six epidemics.

INFLUENZA 251
Over 90% of deaths attributed to influenza or pneumonia
occurred among persons 65 years of age or older.
During major epidemics, hospitalization rates increase 2-
to 5-fold. In nursing homes, the attack rate may be as high
as 60%, with up to 30% fatality rates. The cost of a severe
epidemic has been estimated to be $12 billion.
An influenza pandemic could result in 50,000 - 100,000
deaths. The 1918-1919 influenza is believed to have resulted
in the death of at least 500,000 Americans in less than a year.
Laboratory Diagnosis
The diagnosis of influenza is usually suspected on the
basis of characteristic clinical findings, particularly if
influenza has been reported in the community.
Virus can be isolated from throat and nasopharyngeal
swabs obtained within 3 days of onset of illness. Culture
is performed by inoculation of amniotic or allantoic sac of
chick embryos or certain cell cultures that support viral
replication. A minimum of 48 hours are required to
demonstrate virus, and 1 to 2 additional days to identify
the virus type. As a result, culture is helpful in defining
the etiology of local epidemics, but not in individual case
management.
Serologic confirmation of influenza requires
demonstration of a significant rise in influenza IgG. The
acute specimen should be taken less than 5 days from
onset and a convalescent specimen taken 10-21 days, or,
(preferably, 21 days) following onset.
Complement Fixation (CF) and Hemagglutination
Inhibition (HI) are the serologic tests most commonly
used. The key test is HI, which depends on the ability of
the virus to agglutinate human or chicken erythrocytes
and inhibition of this process by specific antibody.
Diagnosis requires at least a 4-fold rise in antibody titer.
Recently, rapid diagnostic testing for influenza A
antigen has become available and should permit those in
office and clinic settings to assess the need for antiviral use
in patients with influenza A infection in a more timely
In anner.

Reservoir
Humans are the only known reservoir of influenza types B

Transmission
Influenza is transmitted via aerosolized or droplet
transmission from the respiratory tract of infected
persons. A less important mode of transmission of
droplets is by direct contact.
Temporal pattern
Influenza peaks from December to March in temperate
climates, but may occur earlier or later. It occurs
throughout the year in tropical areas.
Communicability
Maximum communicability occurs 1-2 days before onset to
4-5 days thereafter. There is no carrier state.
Secular Trends in the United States
A clear association exists between influenza and excess
mortality. Ten thousand or more excess deaths have been
documented in each of 19 different epidemics during the
years 1957-1986; more than 40,000 excess deaths occurred
in each of several recent epidemics. Outbreaks in nursing
homes have shown attack rates as high as 60%, with case-
fatality ratios as high as 30%.
There is a documented association between influenza and
increased morbidity in “high-risk” adults. Hospitalization
for adults with high-risk medical conditions increases 2-
fold to 5-fold during major epidemics.
The impact of influenza in the United States is quantified
by measuring pneumonia and influenza (P and I) deaths.
Death certificate data are collected from 122 U.S. cities
with populations of >100,000 (approximately 70,000,000).
P and I deaths include all deaths for which pneumonia is
listed as a primary or underlying cause, or for which
influenza is listed on the death certificate.

Influenza Vaccine
Characteristics
The influenza vaccines available in the United States are
composed of inactivated influenza virus. Two types of
inactivated influenza virus vaccines are available. Whole-
virus vaccines used today are prepared using chick
embryo or allantoic fluid. The viruses are subjected to
zonal gradient centrifugation or chromatography and
subsequently inactivated. Disrupted, or split-virus

INFLUENZA
vaccines are prepared using organic solvents or
detergents. Split vaccines are associated with fewer
adverse events among children, perhaps because of
disturbance of the spatial arrangement of the viral lipids.
They are most useful in children 12 years of age or under,
in whom whole-cell vaccines have prohibitive reactogenic
effects.
A cold attenuated live intranasal vaccine has been
under develop-ment for over 20 years. It is widely used in
Russia for adult immunization. This vaccine is not yet
licensed in the United States, but it may be available for
children in the next few years.
In interpandemic years, vaccines are usually composed of
viruses closely related antigenically to circulating strains
of influenza A and B. In recent years, influenza vaccine
has contained three inactivated viruses — two type A
(H3N2 and H1N1), and one type B. The vaccine contains
15 pig of each hemagglutinin antigen per 0.5 ml dose. It
contains thimerosal as a preservative and minute amounts
of egg protein.

/NFLUENZA
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Influenza activity peaks in temperate areas between late
December and early March. Vaccine is most effective when
it precedes exposure by no more than 2 to 4 months. It
should be offered annually, beginning in September for
routine patient visits. Organized campaigns for high-risk
persons who are routinely accessible are optimally
undertaken from October to mid-November. Vaccine may
be given up to and even after influenza activity is
documented in a region. Although most influenza
vaccination activities should be completed by December
(particularly for high-risk persons), providers should
continue to provide vaccine throughout influenza season.
Influenza vaccine dosage, by age group-United States
Age Group Product Dosage Number of Route
Doses
6-35 months | Split virus only 0.25 mL. 1*or 2 IM
3-8 years Split virus only 0.50 mL. 1*or 2 IM
9-12 years Split virus only 0.50 mL. 1 IM
>12 years Whole or split 0.50 mL. 1 IM
*Only one dose is needed if the child received influenza vaccine during a previous influenza season.
One dose of influenza vaccine may be administered annually
for persons 9 years of age or older. Children 6 months to 9
years of age receiving influenza vaccine for the first time
should receive two doses administered at least 1 month apart.
Because of the lower potential for causing febrile reactions,
only split-virus vaccines should be used for children.
They may be labeled as “split,” “subvirion,” or “purified-
surface-antigen” vaccine. Immunogenicity and side effects
of split- and whole-virus vaccines are similar among adults
when vaccines are administered at the recommended
dosage.
Inactivated vaccine should be given by the intramuscular
(IM) route. Other methods, such as intradermal,
subcutaneous, topical, or mucosal should not be used.
Influenza Vaccine Recommendations
• All persons 65 years of age or older
• Persons >6 months of age with
chronic illness
• Residents of long-term care facilities
• Pregnant women
• Persons 6 months to 18 years
receiving chronic aspirin therapy
Influenza vaccine is recommended for all persons 65
years of age or older, regardless of the presence of
chronic illness. Other groups targeted for influenza
vaccine include residents of long-term care facilities,
pregnant women, and persons 6 months to 18 years of age
receiving chronic aspirin therapy (because of the risk of
Reye's syndrome following influenza infection).

Available data suggest that persons with HIV infection
may have prolonged influenza illnesses and are at
increased risk of complications of influenza. Many
persons with HIV infection will develop protective
antibody titers following influenza vaccine. In persons
who have advanced HIV disease and low CD4+ T-
lymphocyte cell counts, influenza vaccine may not induce
protective antibody titers. A second dose of vaccine does
not improve the immune response in these persons.
Recent studies have examined the effect of influenza
vaccine on replication of HIV. Some studies have
demonstrated a transient increase in viral titer in the
blood of vaccinated persons infected with HIV. This
phenomenon has also been reported after other vaccines,
such as tetanus toxoid and pneumococcal polysaccharide
vaccines. Not all studies produced these findings; other
investigators using similar methods have not documented
increased HIV titers after influenza vaccination.
Furthermore, although HIV titers may transiently
increase, there is no evidence of deterioration in CD4
counts or progression of clinical HIV disease. Because
influenza can result in serious illness and complications
and because influenza vaccination may result in protective
antibody titers, ACIP believes that influenza vaccination
will benefit many persons with HIV infection.
Persons who provide essential community services
and students or others in institutional settings (e.g.,
schools and colleges) may be considered for vaccination to
minimize disruption of routine activities during outbreaks.
Foreign travelers may want to be vaccinated. The risk
of exposure to influenza during foreign travel varies,
depending on season of travel, the mode of travel (e.g.,
increased risk during cruises) and destination. Influenza
can occur throughout the year in the tropics. In the
Southern Hemisphere, influenza activity peaks in April-
September. If not vaccinated the previous fall/winter,
persons (especially those in high-risk groups) preparing to
travel to the tropics at any time of the year or to the
Southern Hemisphere during April-September, should be
considered for influenza vaccination before travel. The
most current available vaccine should be used.
Any person who wishes to lessen his/her chance of
acquiring influenza infection may be vaccinated.

Adverse Reactions
• Local reactions 15%-20%
• Fever, malaise uncommon
• Allergic reactions rare
- Neurological very rare
reactions
Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
Local reactions are the most common adverse events
following influenza vaccination. They include soreness,
erythema, and induration at the site of injection. These
events are transient, generally lasting 1 to 2 days. Local
reactions are reported in 15%-20% of vaccinees.
Non-specific systemic symptoms including fever, chills,
malaise, and myalgias are reported in “1% of vaccine
recipients. These symptoms usually occur in those with
no previous exposure to the viral antigens in the vaccine.
They usually occur within 6-12 hours of vaccination and
last 1-2 days. Recent reports indicate that systemic
symptoms are no more common than in persons given a
placebo injection.
Rarely, immediate hypersensitivity, presumably
allergic, reactions (such as hives, angioedema, allergic
asthma, or systemic anaphylaxis) occur after influenza
vaccination. These reactions probably result from
hypersensitivity to some vaccine component. The majority
are most likely related to residual egg protein. Although
current influenza vaccines contain only a small quantity of
egg protein, this protein may induce immediate
hypersensitivity reactions among persons with severe egg
allergy. Persons who have developed hives, had swelling
of the lips or tongue, or experienced acute respiratory
distress or collapse after eating eggs should consult a
physician for appropriate evaluation to assist in
determining whether influenza vaccination may proceed
or should be deferred. Persons with documented
immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to eggs
— including those who have had occupational asthma or
other allergic responses from exposure to egg protein —
may also be at increased risk for reactions from influenza
vaccine, and similar consultation should be considered.
Protocols have been published for influenza vaccination of
patients who have egg allergies and medical conditions
that place them at increased risk for influenza infection or
its complications.
The potential exists for hypersensitivity reactions to any
vaccine component. Although exposure to vaccines
containing thimerosal can lead to induction of
hypersensitivity, most patients do not develop reactions to
thimerosal administered as a component of vaccines, even
when patch or intradermal tests for thimerosal indicate
hypersensitivity. When it has been reported,
hypersensitivity to thimerosal has usually consisted of
local delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.

Unlike the 1976 swine influenza vaccine, subsequent
vaccines prepared from other virus strains have not been
clearly associated with an increased frequency of
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). However, obtaining a
precise estimate of a small increase in risk is difficult for a
rare condition such as GBS, which has an annual
background incidence of only one to two cases per 100,000
adult population.
Among persons who received the swine influenza vaccine
in 1976, the rate of GBS exceeded the background rate by
less than one case per 100,000 vaccinations. Even if GBS
were a true adverse event in subsequent years, the
estimated risk for GBS was much lower than one per
100,000. Further, the risk is substantially less than that
for severe influenza or its complications, which could be
prevented by vaccination, especially for persons aged 65
years or older, and those with a medical indication for
influenza vaccine.
Although the incidence of GBS in the general population
is very low, persons with a history of GBS have a
substantially greater likelihood of subsequently
developing GBS than persons without such a history
irrespective of vaccination. As a result, the likelihood of
coincidentally developing GBS after influenza vaccination
is expected to be greater among persons with a history of
GBS than among persons with no history of GBS.
Whether influenza vaccination might be causally
associated with this risk for recurrence is not known. It
seems prudent for persons known to have developed GBS
within 6 weeks of a previous influenza vaccination to
avoid subsequent influenza vaccination. For most persons
with a history of GBS who are at high risk for severe
complications from influenza the established benefits of
influenza vaccination justify yearly vaccination.
Although influenza vaccination can inhibit the clearance of
warfarin and theophylline, studies have failed to show any
adverse clinical effects attributable to these drugs among
patients receiving influenza vaccine.

Influenza Vaccine
Strategies to Improve Coverage
• Ensure systematic and automatic
offering of vaccine to high-risk groups
• Educate health care providers and
patients
• Address concerns about adverse events
• Emphasize physician recommendation
Neither pregancy nor breastfeeding is a contraindication
to influenza vaccination.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Influenza vaccine is generally shipped in an insulated
container with coolant packs. Although some brands of
influenza vaccine can tolerate room temperature for a few
days, CDC recommends that the vaccine be stored at
refrigerator temperature (2'-8"C (35°-46°F]). Influenza
vaccine must not be frozen.
Opened multidose vials may be used until the expiration
date printed on the package if not visibly contaminated.
Year 2000 Objectives and Coverage Levels
Year 2000 objectives are to increase influenza vaccination
levels to 60% or higher among high-risk populations (80% in
residents of chronic care facilities) and to reduce epidemic-
related pneumonia and influenza-related deaths among
persons 65 years of age and older. In 1997, 66% of persons
65 years of age and older reported influenza vaccine in the
previous year. Vaccination levels were lower in black and
Hispanic persons than among non-Hispanic white persons.
Strategies for improving influenza Vaccine
Coverage
Up to 75% of persons at high risk for influenza or who die
from pneumonia and influenza may have received care in
a physician's office during the previous year. One study
indicated that all persons who died from pneumonia or
influenza and did not reside in a nursing home, had at
least one medical visit during the previous year.
An average of less than 20% of persons in high-risk
groups receive influenza vaccine each year. More
effective strategies for delivering vaccine to high-risk
persons, their health care providers, and household
contacts are needed. Persons for whom the vaccine is
recommended can be identified and immunized in a
variety of settings.
Outpatient clinics and physicians' offices
Persons who should receive vaccine should be identified
and their charts marked. Vaccine use should be
promoted, encouraged and recommended beginning in
September and continuing through the influenza season.
Those without regularly scheduled visits should receive
reminders.




## p. 261 (#273) ############################################

IWFLUENZA
Nursing homes and other residential long-term care
facilities
Immunization should be routinely provided to all residents
at one period of time immediately preceding the influenza
season; consent should be obtained at the time of admission.
Acute-care hospitals and continuing care centers
Persons for whom vaccine is recommended who are
hospitalized from September through March should be
vaccinated prior to discharge.
In outpatient facilities providing continuing care to
high-risk patients (e.g., hemodialysis centers, hospital
specialty-care clinics, outpatient rehabilitation programs),
all patients should be offered vaccine shortly before the
onset of the influenza season.
Visiting nurses and others providing home care to high-
risk persons
Persons providing home care should identify high-risk
patients and administer vaccine in the home, if necessary.
Facilities providing services to persons aged - 65 years
Vaccine should be offered to all unvaccinated residents or
attendees on site at facilities providing services to
persons ~65 years of age (e.g., retirement communities,
recreation centers). Education and publicity programs
should also be conducted in conjunction with other
interventions.
Health care for travelers
Indications for influenza vaccine should be reviewed prior
to travel and vaccine offered, if appropriate.
Administrators of all of the above facilities and
organizations should arrange for influenza vaccine to be
offered to all personnel before the influenza season.
Additionally, household members of high-risk persons and
others with whom they will be in contact should receive
written information about why they should receive the
vaccine and where to obtain it.

Antiviral Agents for Influenza A
Amantadine hydrochloride and rimantadine hydrochloride
are antiviral drugs that have specific activity against
influenza A viruses. Both drugs interfere with the
replication cycle of type A influenza viruses, although
specific mechanisms of their antiviral activity are not
completely understood. Both drugs are 70%-90% effective
in preventing illnesses caused by naturally occurring
strains of type A influenza viruses. When compared with
amantadine, rimantadine causes fewer side effects in
older people. Neither is effective against type B
influenza. Amantadine or rimantadine prophylaxis is
recommended in the following situations:
* As an adjunct to late vaccination of high-risk
persons during the 2 weeks it takes to develop
an antibody response following vaccination.
• In unvaccinated persons, to reduce the spread of
infection and maintain care for high-risk
persons, both in institutions and at home.
• For immunodeficient persons who may have a
poor antibody response to influenza vaccine.
• For high risk persons for whom influenza
vaccine is contraindicated.
Amantadine causes side effects (dizziness, nausea, difficulty
concentrating, difficulty sleeping) and compliance with a
daily drug is often a problem. Its dosage must be reduced
in those with impaired renal function. Neither amantadine
nor rimantadine should be used in lieu of vaccination.
Amantadine and rimantadine can be used to decrease the
duration of fever and other systemic symptoms due to
influenza A, if administered shortly after onset of
symptoms (within 48 hours).
Refer to the current influenza ACIP statement for more
details on antiviral agents.
Nosocomial Influenza Control
Many patients in general hospitals, and especially in
referral centers, are likely to be high-risk patients.
Hospitalized susceptible patients may acquire influenza
from patients, hospital employees, or visitors. The
preferred method of control is to vaccinate high-risk
patients and medical personnel prior to the outbreak.

INFLUENZA 263
During community influenza A activity, the use of antiviral
prophylaxis may be considered for high-risk patients not
immunized or immunized too recently to have protective
antibody levels. Antivirals may also be considered for
unimmunized hospital personnel. Other measures include
restricting visitors with respiratory illness; cohorting
patients with influenza for 5 days following onset of illness;
and postponing elective admission of patients with
uncomplicated illness.
Influenza Surveillance
Reasons for surveillance include (1) to monitor the
prevalence of circulating strains and to detect new strains
necessary for vaccine formulation; (2) to estimate
influenza-related impact on morbidity, mortality, and
economic loss; (3) to rapidly detect outbreaks; (4) to assist
disease control through rapid preventive action (e.g.,
chemoprophylaxis of unvaccinated high-risk patients).
CDC receives weekly surveillance reports from the states
showing the extent of influenza activity. Reports are
classified into four categories: (1) no cases, (2) sporadic,
(3) regional (cases occurring in counties collectively
contributing less than 50% of a state's population),
(4) widespread (cases occurring in counties collectively
contributing 50% or more of a state's population).
Sentinel Family Physician Network
Physicians nationwide provide weekly telephone
information about the number of cases and hospitalizations
that have occurred in their practices; a subgroup of
physicians collect nasopharyngeal specimens from selected
cases for submission to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) for culture confirmation.
Epidemiologic Surveillance Project (ESP)
The Epidemiologic Surveillance Project (ESP) was first
operated for influenza during the 1987-1988 influenza season.
Case reports of culture-confirmed influenza are submitted
electronically to CDC from participating health departments.
Additional case-specific information permits more detailed
epidemiologic analysis than the other reporting systems.
Laboratory surveillance
Fifty-three World Health Organization (WHO)
Collaborating Laboratories in the U.S. regularly submit
reports on the number of specimens tested and the
number and type of influenza viruses isolated for each
week from early October through mid-May to the WHO
Collaborating Center for Influenza at CDC.
Influenza Surveillance
• Monitor prevalence of circulating strains
and detect new strains
• Rapidly detect outbreaks

wide-spread illness and death throughout the
United States each year. Pneumococcal disease kills
more people in the United States every year - 40,000 or
more - than all other vaccine preventable diseases
combined. The bacterium, also called pneumococcus, was
first identified by Pasteur in 1881 from the saliva of a
patient with rabies. The association between the
pneumococcus bacterium and lobar pneumonia was first
described by Friedlander and Talamon in 1883, but
pneumococcal pneumonia was confused with other types of
pneumonia until the discovery of the Gram stain in 1884.
From 1915 to 1945, the chemical structure and antigenicity
of the pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, its
association with virulence, and the role of bacterial
polysaccharides in human disease were explained. More
than 80 serotypes of pneumococci had been described by
1940.
D; CAUSED BY STREPTOCOCCUSPNEUMONIAE, RESULTS IN
Efforts to develop effective pneumococcal vaccines began
as early as 1911. However, with the advent of penicillin in
the 1940s, interest in the vaccine declined, until it was
observed that many patients still died despite antibiotic
treatment. By the late 1960s, efforts were again being
made to develop a polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. The
first pneumococcal vaccine was licensed in the United
States in 1977.
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Streptococcus pneumoniae are lancet-shaped, gram-
positive, facultative anaerobic organisms. They are
typically observed in pairs (diplococci) but may also occur
singularly or in short chains. Some pneumococci are
encapsulated, their surfaces composed of complex
polysaccharides. Encapsulated organisms are pathogenic
for humans and experimental animals, whereas organisms
without capsular polysaccharides are not. Capsular

Clinical Syndromes
* Pneumonia
• Bacteremia
• Meningitis
Pneumococcal Pneumonia
Clinical Features
• Abrupt onset
• Fever
• Shaking chills
• Productive cough
• Pleuritic chest pain
• Dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxia
Pneumococcal Pneumonia
- Estimated 150,000-570,000 cases per year
- Up to 36% of adult community-acquired
pneumonia and 50% of hospital-acquired
pneumonia
- Common bacterial complication of
influenza and measles
- Case-fatality rate 5%-7%, higher in elderly
polysaccharides are the primary basis for the pathogenicity
of the organism. They are antigenic and form the basis for
classifying pneumococci by serotypes. At least 83 serotypes
have been identified, based on their reaction with type-
specific antisera. Type-specific antibody to capsular
polysaccharide is protective. These antibodies and
complement interact to opsonize pneumococci, which
facilitates phagocytosis and clearance of the organism.
Antibodies to some pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides
may cross-react with related types as well as with other
bacteria, providing protection to additional serotypes.
Pneumococci are common inhabitants of the respiratory
tract, and may be isolated from the nasopharynx of 5% to
70% of normal adults. Rates of asymptomatic carriage
vary with age, environment, and the presence of upper
respiratory infections. Only 5%-10% of adults without
children are carriers. In schools and orphanages, 27% to
58% of students and residents may be carriers. On
military installations, as many as 50% to 60% of service
personnel may be carriers. The duration of carriage
varies and is generally longer in children than adults. In
addition, the relationship of carriage to the development
of natural immunity is poorly understood.
Clinical Features
The major clinical syndromes of invasive pneumococcal
disease include pneumonia, bacteremia, and
meningitis. The immunologic mechanism that allows
disease to occur in a carrier is not clearly understood.
However, disease most often occurs when a predisposing
condition exists, particularly pulmonary disease.
Prieumococcal pneumonia is the most common clinical
presentation of invasive pneumococcal disease. The
incubation period of pneumococcal pneumonia is short,
about 1 to 3 days. Symptoms generally include an abrupt
onset of fever and shaking chills or rigors. Typically there
is a single rigor, and repeated shaking chills are
uncommon. Other common symptoms include pleuritic
chest pain, cough productive of mucopurulent, rusty
sputum, dyspnea (shortness of breath), tachypnea (rapid
breathing), hypoxia (poor oxygenation), tachycardia (rapid
heart rate), malaise, and weakness. Nausea, vomiting, and
headaches occur less frequently.
An estimated 150,000 - 570,000 cases of pneumococcal
pneumonia occur annually in the United States.
Pneumococci account for up to 36% of adult community-
acquired pneumonia and 50% of hospital-acquired
pneumonia. It is a common bacterial complication of
influenza and measles. The case-fatality rate is 5%-7%,
and may be much higher in elderly persons.

PWEU/MOCOCCAL DISEASE
Complications of pneumococcal pneumonia include
empyema (i.e., infection of the pleural space), pericarditis,
or inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart, and
endobronchial obstruction, with atelectasis and lung
abscess formation.
An estimated 16,000 to 55,000 cases of pneumococcal
bacteremia occur each year. Bacteremia occurs in about
25%-30% of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. The
overall mortality rate for bacteremia is about 20%, but may
be as high as 60% in elderly patients. Patients with
asplenia who develop bacteremia may experience a
fulminant clinical course.
Pneumococci cause 13%-19% of all cases of bacterial
meningitis in the United States. An estimated 3,000 to
6,000 cases of pneumococcal meningitis occur each year,
and pneumococcal meningitis is now the leading cause of
meningitis in children under five years of age in the
United States. One-quarter of patients with pneumococcal
meningitis also have pneumonia. The clinical symptoms,
spinal fluid profile and neurologic complications are
similar to other forms of purulent bacterial meningitis.
Symptoms may include headache, lethargy, vomiting,
irritability, fever, nuchal rigidity, cranial nerve signs,
seizures and coma. The mortality rate of pneumococcal
meningitis is about 30%, but may be as high as 80% in
elderly persons. Neurologic sequelae are common among
survivors.
Pneumococci cause for 30%-60% of episodes of acute otitis
media in infants and children. Complications of
pneumococcal otitis media may include mastoiditis and
meningitis.
Laboratory Diagnosis
A definitive diagnosis of infection with Streptococcus
pneumoniae generally relies on isolation of the organism
from blood or other normally sterile body sites. Tests are
also available to detect capsular polysaccharide antigen in
body fluids.
The appearance of lancet-shaped diplococci on Gram
stain is suggestive of pneumococcal infection, but
interpretation of stained sputum specimens may be
difficult because of the presence of normal nasopharyngeal
bacteria. The suggested criteria for obtaining a diagnosis
of pneumococcal pneumonia using Gram stained sputnum
includes >25 white blood cells and <10 epithelial cells per
100-power field, and a predominance of gram-positive
diplococci.
Pneumococcal Bacteremia
• Estimated 16,000 - 55,000 cases
per year in the United States
• Rates higher among elderly and
very young infants
• Case fatality rate ~20%; up to 60%
among the elderly
Pneumococcal Meningitis
• Estimated 3,000 - 6,000 cases per year
in the United States
• 13%-1.9% of all cases of bacterial
meningitis
• Case-fatality rate ~30%; up to 80% in
the elderly
• Neurologic sequelae common among
survivors

The quellung reaction (capsular swelling; capsular
precipitation reaction) is a test that provides rapid
identification of pneumococci in clinical specimens
including spinal fluid, sputum, and exudates. The
procedure involves mixing loopfuls of bacteria in
suspension, pneumococcal antiserum, and methylene blue
on the surface of a glass slide and examination under oil
immersion. If the reaction is positive, the organism will be
surrounded by a large capsule.
Counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) is a rapid and
specific diagnostic method to detect pneumococcal
capsular polysaccharide antigen in various specimens
including blood, spinal fluid, urine, pleural fluid, and
peritoneal fluid. Sensitivity is highest in spinal fluid. The
latex or co-agglutination test is similar to the CIE, but has
the advantages of being easier to perform and more
sensitive for detecting antigen in spinal fluid. None of the
rapid tests are useful for diagnosing pneumonia using
sputum, because of poor specificity.
Medical Management
Penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment of
pneumococcal disease. However, patients who are allergic
to penicillin may be given cephalosporins (depending on
the severity of the penicillin allergy) or erythromycin for
pneumonia, and chloramphenicol for meningitis. The
route, dosage, schedule, and duration of therapy depend
on the severity of the illness. Resistance to penicillin and
other antibiotics is rising, and studies indicate that 5% to
15% of pneumococci are resistant.
There are no specific recommendations regarding isolation
of patients with pneumococcal disease, although
respiratory secretions may be infective for 24 hours after
the start of effective antimicrobial therapy.
Epidemiology
Occurrence
Pneumococcal disease occurs throughout the world.
Reservoir
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen. The
reservoir for pneumococci is presumably the nasopharynx
of asymptomatic human carriers. There is no animal or
insect vector.


## p. 269 (#281) ############################################

PNEU/MOCOCCAL DISEASE
Transmission
Transmission of Streptococcus pneumoniae occurs as the
result of direct person-to-person contact via droplets, and
by “autoinoculation” in persons carrying the bacteria in
their upper respiratory tract. The pneumococcal
serotypes most often responsible for causing infection are
those most frequently found in carriers. The spread of the
organism within a family or household is influenced by
such factors as crowding, season, and the presence of
upper respiratory infections or pneumococcal disease such
as pneumonia or otitis media. The spread of pneumococcal
disease is usually associated with increased carriage rates.
However, high carriage rates do not appear to increase the
risk of disease transmission in households.
Temporal pattern
Pneumococcal infections are more common during the
winter and in early spring when respiratory diseases are
more prevalent.
Communicability
The period of communicability for pneumococcal disease is
unknown, but presumably transmission can occur as long
as the organism appears in respiratory discharges.

Recent studies estimate that the overall incidence of
pneumococcal bacteremia (blood borne infection) in the
United States is 15-19 cases per 100,000 population. For
adults 65 years of age and older, the incidence of
bacteremia increases to 50 per 100,000 population.

Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
• 1977 14-valent polysaccharide
vaccine licensed
• 1983 23-valent polysaccharide
vaccine licensed
Overall, children 2 years of age and younger have a very
high risk of bacteremia, with an incidence of 160 per
100,000. One recent study in California suggests the
highest incidence is among children 13-18 months of age
(200/100,000 population). The incidence of pneumococcal
pneumonia may be three to five times that of bacteremia.
Pneumococcal disease occurs more often in males than in
females at all stages of life (M:F = 3:2).
Mortality from pneumococcal disease is highest among
patients with bacteremia or meningitis, in patients with
underlying medical conditions, and in very young or older
persons. Among some high-risk patients, up to 40% of
those with bacteremic disease die. High death rates from
bacteremia occur despite therapy with antibiotics.
Fatality rates increase from 30%-40% in those 50 to 69
years of age to 55%-60% in persons 70 or older.
Community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia is usually a
sporadic disease in carriers who have a breakdown in their
pulmonary defense mechanisms. Secondary pneumococcal
pneumonia is the most common bacterial complication of
both influenza and measles. However, epidemics of
pneumococcal pneumonia are uncommon. When
epidemics occur, they are usually in crowded
environments, such as jails and nursing homes. During
outbreaks, persons with invasive disease often have
underlying illness and may have a high fatality rate.
Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine
Characteristics
Pneumococcal vaccine is composed of purified
preparations of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide.
The first polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine was
licensed in the United States in 1977. It contained
purified capsular polysaccharide antigen from 14 different
types of pneumococcal bacteria. In 1983, a 23-valent
polysaccharide vaccine was licensed and replaced the 14-
valent vaccine, which is no longer produced. This
pneumococcal vaccine contains polysaccharide antigen
from the 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria that cause 88%
of bacteremic pneumococcal disease. In addition, cross-
reactivity occurs for several capsular types which account
for an additional 8% of bacteremic disease.
Two vaccines are produced by U.S. manufacturers:
Pneumovax 23, by Merck & Co., and Pnu-Immune 23, by
Lederle Laboratories. Both of the manufacturers' single
vaccine dose (0.5 ml) contains 25 mcg of each antigen and
includes either phenol or thimerosal as a preservative.
Pneumococcal vaccine is given by injection, and may be
administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously.








## p. 271 (#283) ############################################

PWEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE
Immunogenicityand vaccine efficacy
Most healthy adults who receive pneumococcal vaccine
develop antibodies against the serotypes contained in the
vaccine, usually within 2 to 3 weeks after vaccination.
Older adults and persons with some chronic illnesses may
not respond as well, if at all. In children under 2 years of
age, antibody response to most serotypes is generally poor.
This creates a significant problem since 80% of childhood
pneumococcal disease occurs in this age group.
Vaccination produces a significant rise in antibody in
>80% of healthy young adults. Antibody response in the
elderly, and persons with chronic illness and
immunodeficiency is lower. Elevated antibody levels
persist for at least 5 years in healthy adults, but fall more
quickly in persons with certain underlying illnesses.
Pneumococcal vaccine efficacy studies have resulted in
various estimates of clinical effectiveness. Overall, the
vaccine is 60%-70% effective in preventing invasive
disease. The vaccine appears to be less effective in
preventing nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia. The
vaccine may be less effective in preventing pneumococcal
infection in some groups, particularly those with
significant underlying illness. Although the vaccine may
not be as effective in some persons, especially those who
do not have normal resistance to infections, it is still
recommended for such persons because they are at high
risk of developing severe disease.
Studies comparing patterns of pneumococcal carriage
before and after vaccination have not shown clinically
significant decreases in carrier rates among vaccinees. In
addition, no change in the distribution of vaccine-type and
non-vaccine-type organisms have been observed as the
result of vaccination.
Vaccination Schedule and Use
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be
administered routinely to all adults 65 years of age and
older. The vaccine is also indicated for adults with
normal immune systems who have chronic illnesses,
including cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease,
diabetes, alcoholism, cirrhosis, or cerebrospinal fluid
leaks.

Pneumococcal Vaccine
Recommendations
• Splenic absence
• Sickle cell disease

• Immunosuppression, including HIV
Infection
Immunocompromised adults who are at increased risk
of pneumococcal disease or its complications should also
be vaccinated. This group includes persons with splenic
dysfunction or absence (either from disease or surgical
removal), Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma, multiple
myeloma, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome (a
type of kidney disease), or conditions such as organ
transplantation associated with immunosuppression.
Adults with asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV infection
should be vaccinated.
Children 2 years old and older with long-term
illnesses that are associated with a high risk of serious
pneumococcal infections or its complications should be
vaccinated. These include children whose spleens have
been surgically removed, as well as those who have sickle
cell disease, nephrotic syndrome, or CSF leaks. Children
with immunosuppression, including those with
asymptomatic or symptomatic HIV, should be vaccinated.
Frequent diseases of the upper respiratory system,
including infections of the ear or sinuses, in children who
are otherwise healthy, are not reasons to use this vaccine.
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine will not prevent
otitis media, and should not be used for this purpose.
Pneumococcal vaccine should be considered for persons
living in special environments or social settings with an
identified increased risk of pneumococcal disease or its
complications, such as certain Native American
populations.
If elective splenectomy is being considered, the vaccine
should be given at least 2 weeks before the operation.
Similarly, there should also be a two-week interval
between vaccination and initiation of cancer chemotherapy
or other immunosuppressive therapy.
Providers should not withhold vaccination in the absence
of an immunization record or complete record. The
patient's verbal history may be used to determine
vaccination status. Persons with uncertain or
unknown vaccination status should be vaccinated.
Revaccination
Following vaccination with pneumococcal polysaccharide
vaccine, antibody levels decline after 5-10 years and
decrease more rapidly in some groups than others.
However, the relationship between antibody titer and
protection from invasive disease is not certain (i.e., higher
antibody level does not necessarily mean better
protection), so the ability to define the need for
revaccination based only on serology is limited. In

addition, currently available pneumococcal polysaccharide
vaccines elicit a T-independent response, and do not
produce a sustained increase (“boost”) in antibody titers.
Available data do not indicate a substantial increase in
protection in the majority of revaccinated persons.
Because of the lack of evidence of improved protection
with multiple doses of pneumococcal vaccine, routine
revaccination of immunocompetent persons
previously vaccinated with 23-valent polysaccharide
vaccine is not recommended. However, revaccination is
recommended for persons 2 years of age and older who are
at highest risk for serious pneumococcal infection and for
those who are likely to have a rapid decline in
pneumococcal antibody levels.
Only one revaccination dose is recommended for
high-risk persons. The second dose should be
administered five or more years after the first dose.
Revaccination 3 years after the previous dose may be
considered for children at highest risk for severe
pneumococcal infection who would be aged 10 years or less
at the time of revaccination.
Persons at highest risk include all people >2 years of age
with functional or anatomic asplenia (e.g., sickle cell
disease or splenectomy), HIV infection, leukemia,
lymphoma, Hodgkins disease, multiple myeloma,
generalized malignancy, chronic renal failure, nephrotic
syndrome, or other conditions associated with
immunosuppression (e.g., organ or bone marrow
transplantation) and those receiving immunosuppressive
chemotherapy, including long-term corticosteroids.
Persons aged 65 years and older should be administered a
second dose of pneumococcal vaccine if they received the
vaccine more than 5 years previously, and were less than
65 years of age at the time of the first dose.
Adverse Reactions Following Vaccination
The most common adverse reactions following
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are local reactions.
From 30% to 50% of vaccinees report pain, swelling, or
erythema at the site of injection. These reactions usually
persist for less than 48 hours. Moderate systemic
reactions (such as fever and myalgias) are uncommon
(<1% of vaccinees), and more severe systemic adverse
events are rare. Local reations are reported more
frequently following a second dose of pneumococcal
vaccine than following the first dose.
A transient increase in HIV replication has been reported
following pneumococcal vaccine. No clinical or immunologic
deterioration has been reported in these persons.

Contraindications and Precautions to
Vaccination
A serious allergic reaction to a dose of pneumococcal
vaccine or a vaccine component is a contraindication to
further doses of vaccine. Such allergic reactions are rare.
Persons with moderate or severe acute illness should
not be vaccinated until their condition improves.
However, minor illnesses, such as upper respiratory
infections, are not a contraindication to vaccination.
The safety of pneumococcal vaccine for pregnant women
has not been studied. It should generally not be given to
healthy pregnant women. Women who are at high risk of
pneumococcal disease and who are candidates for
pneumococcal vaccine should be vaccinated before
pregnancy.
Vaccine Storage and Handling
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be shipped in
an insulated container with coolant packs. Although
pneumococcal vaccines can tolerate room temperature for
a few days, CDC recommends that the vaccine be stored at
refrigerator temperature (2°-8°C (35°-46°F]).
Pheumococcal polysaccharide vaccine must not be
frozen.
Opened multidose vials may be used until the expiration
date printed on the package if not visibly contaminated.
Goals and Coverage Levels
The target groups for pneumococcal vaccine and influenza
vaccine overlap. These vaccines can be given at the same
time at different sites without increased side effects. The
Healthy People 2000 goal is to achieve 60% coverage for
pneumococcal vaccine among persons at highest risk of
pneumococcal disease. Data from the 1997 Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS, a population-
based, random-digit-dialed telephone survey of the non-
institutionalized U.S. population 18 years of age and
older) indicate that 45% of persons 65 years of age or older
had ever received pneumococcal vaccine, an increase of
9% since the 1995 survey. Pneumococcal vaccination
levels increased in all but 4 states. Vaccination levels in
black and hispanic persons were significantly lower than
in white persons.













## p. 275 (#287) ############################################

PWEU/MOCOCCAL DISEASE
Opportunities to vaccinate high-risk persons are missed
both at the time of hospital discharge and during visits to
clinicians' offices. Effective programs for vaccine delivery
are needed, including offering the vaccine in hospitals at
discharge, clinicians' offices, nursing homes, and other
chronic care facilities.
More than two-thirds of the persons who have been
hospitalized with serious pneumococcal disease had been
admitted to a hospital in the preceding 3 to 5 years. In
addition, persons who frequently visit physicians and who
have chronic conditions are more likely to be at high risk
of pneumococcal infection than those who require
infrequent visits. Screening and subsequent
immunization of hospitalized persons found to be at high
risk could have a significant impact in reducing
complications and death associated with pneumococcal
disease.
Future Pneumococcal Vaccines
Polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine is modestly
efficacious in preventing invasive pneumococcal disease,
and less efficacious against pneumococcal pneumonia.
More importantly, the current vaccine is not effective in
children under 2 years of age, the age group with the
highest incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease. As
noted above, Streptococcus pneumoniae is now the leading
cause of bacterial meningitis in infants and young
children.
Efforts have been underway for several years to develop a
conjugate pneumococcal vaccine - a vaccine that could
prevent invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and
young children. In late 1997, the results of a clinical trial
of a 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in infants
was announced. It appears that this vaccine is highly
effective in preventing pneumococcal meningitis in infants
as young as 6 months of age. The manufacturer is
currently preparing a product license application for the
vaccine. If approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, this conjugate pneumococcal vaccine
could be available in the United States within 1-2 years.

Vaccine Sofety
MMUNIZATIONS ARE AMONG THE MOST COST-EFFECTIVE AND WIDELY
used public health interventions. However, no vaccine
is perfectly safe or effective. As the incidence of
vaccine-preventable diseases is reduced by increasing
coverage with vaccines, public concerns refocus from the
risk of getting disease to health risks associated with
vaccines. Health effects reported as being associated with
vaccines may be 1) true adverse reactions or 2) associated
with vaccination only by coincidence. In the United States,
both types of events are reported to the Vaccine Adverse
Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is administered
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Approximately 10,000 cases of adverse health effects are
reported to VAERS each year. The number exceeds the
current reported incidence of most vaccine-preventable
childhood diseases combined, although it is still much less
than the pre-vaccine era disease incidence. Close
monitoring and timely assessment of suspected vaccine
adverse events are critical to prevent the public's loss of
confidence in vaccines. Public concerns about the safety of
whole cell pertussis vaccine in the 1980's resulted in
decreased vaccine coverage levels and the return of
epidemic disease in Japan, Sweden, United Kingdom and
several other countries. In the U.S., similar concerns led
to increases in the number of lawsuits against
manufacturers and the price of vaccines, and a decrease in
the number of manufacturers willing to produce vaccines.
In developing countries vaccine safety concerns are
different than those in the United States. There they are
more about inadequate control of vaccine production and
administration errors such as reuse of needles resulting in

the transmission of blood-borne pathogens. It is anticipated
that as nations in both developed and developing countries
reach high vaccine coverage and vaccine-preventable
diseases become less visible, public concern about vaccine
safety may also threaten the stability of immunization
programs in developing countries.
Public health recommendations for vaccine programs and
practices represents a dynamic balancing of risks and
benefits. Vaccine safety or risk monitoring is necessary to
accurately weigh this balance and adjust vaccination
policy. This was done, for example, in the U.S. with
smallpox and polio as they neared global eradication.
Complications due to both vaccines exceeded that due to
the disease, leading to discontinuation of routine smallpox
vaccinations (prior to actual global eradication) and the
shift from live oral polio vaccine to a combined schedule
with inactivated polio vaccine.
Research in vaccine safety can help to distinguish true
vaccine reactions from coincidental unrelated events and
may help to maintain public confidence in immunizations
and the credibility of immunization programs. If
immunization programs are to take full advantage of the
new vaccines made possible by biotechnology, they will
require an understanding of both the risks and the benefits
of immunizations.
The Importance of Vaccine Safety
A higher standard of safety is generally expected of
vaccines than of other medical interventions because, in
contrast to most pharmaceutical products which are
administered to ill persons for curative purposes, vaccines
are generally given to healthy persons to prevent disease.
Public tolerance of adverse reactions related to products
given to healthy persons, especially healthy infants, is
substantially lower than to products administered to
persons who are already sick. This lower risk tolerance for
vaccines translates into a need to investigate the possible
causes of rare adverse events following vaccinations than
would be acceptable for other pharmaceutical products.
High safety standards are required for vaccines because of
the large number of persons who receive them including
those persons who may be compelled by state or local
immunization requirements for school entry. The medical
maxim “first do no harm” applies even more in public
health than in clinical medicine where decisions affect
fewer persons.
Importance of Vaccine Safety

-Moral duty; public health - clinical medicine

VACCINE SAFETY 279
Vaccine safety studies require a higher standard of
accuracy and timeliness, because of the narrow margin of
error. Unlike many classes of drugs for which other
effective therapy may be substituted, vaccines generally
have few alternative strains or types (oral and inactivated
poliovirus vaccines being the best known exceptions). The
decision to withdraw a vaccine or switch between strains
may also have wide ramifications. For example, the
withdrawal of the 1976 “swine influenza” vaccine due to
elevated risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome led to many
lawsuits and low public acceptance for influenza
vaccinations for a decade. Establishing associations with
vaccines and promptly defining the attributable risks are
critical in placing adverse events in the proper risk-benefit
perspective. An erroneous association or attributable risk
can undermine confidence in a vaccine and have disastrous
consequences for vaccine acceptance and disease
incidence. Finally, because many vaccinations are
mandated for public health reasons and because no vaccine
is perfectly safe, several countries have established
compensation programs for persons who may have been
injured by vaccination. Accurate assessments of whether
adverse events can be caused by specific vaccines are
required to justly compensate persons injured by true
reactions and to disallow false or unrelated claims.
Limitations in Knowledge of Vaccine Safety
In 1967, the lack of scientific documentation on the
hazards of immunization moved Sir Graham Wilson,
former director of the Public Health Laboratory Service in
the U.K., to compile the first vaccine safety review. He
noted fear of compensation claims or inadvertent support
to “anti-vaccionalists” as possible explanations for the
incomplete records.
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986
established a Committee from the Institute of Medicine
(IOM) to review the adverse consequences of childhood
vaccines. This group found severe limits in the knowledge
and research capability on vaccine safety. Of the 76 vaccine
adverse events they reviewed for causal relation, 50 (66%)
had no or inadequate research. Specifically, the IOM
Committees identified the following limitations:
1) inadequate understanding of biologic mechanisms
underlying adverse events; 2) insufficient or inconsistent
information from case reports and case series;

capacity and accomplishment are not improved, future
reviews of vaccine safety would be hindered.
Vaccine safety research requires expertise in “rare
disease" epidemiology. Such studies are costly and difficult
to organize and may be less familiar to most immunization
experts with mainly an infectious disease background.
Like other areas of safety (e.g., food, transport), “vaccine
safety” cannot be studied directly but, can be inferred by
the sum of its inverse: an absence of specific problems
when appropriate surveillance and risk management
systems are in place. Scientifically, it is more challenging
to prove than disprove a concept, especially a negative
concept.
Methods of Monitoring Safety
Pre-licensure
Vaccines, like other pharmaceutical products, undergo
extensive safety and efficacy evaluations in the laboratory,
in animals, and in sequentially-phased human clinical
trials prior to licensure. Phase I trials usually number in
the tens and can only detect the grossest toxicity. Phase II
trials generally enroll hundreds of persons and, when
carefully coordinated, can provide important conclusions.
These conclusions might address the relationship between
the concentration of antigens, number of vaccine
components, formulation technique, effect of successive
doses, and profile of common reactions, which impact on
the choice of the vaccines chosen for Phase III. The
samples for Phase III vaccine trials are principally based
on efficacy considerations. The study sample size usually
ranges between 100's-10,000's participants. The duration of
observation is also generally limited to one or two years.
The availability of unvaccinated control groups allows
medical scientists to clearly identify and observe common
local and systemic reactions (e.g., injection site swelling,
fever, fussiness).

Post-licensure
Because rare reactions, delayed reactions, or reactions
within sub-populations may not be detected before vaccines
are licensed, post-licensure (also called post-marketing)
evaluation of vaccine safety is critical. Historically, this has
relied on passive surveillance and ad hoc epidemiologic
studies. More recently, Phase IV trials and preestablished
large-linked databases (LLDB)'s have been added to improve
our methodology capabilities to study rare risks of specific
immunizations. Furthermore, because vaccines are biologic
rather than chemical in nature, variation in rates of adverse
events (and immunogenicity), by recipient population,
manufacturer, or even by lot might be expected. Post-
licensure surveillance systems may detect potential lot-
specific irregularities in a timely manner. Fundamental to
preventing safety problems is the assurance that any
vaccines for public use are made under Good Manufacturing
Practices (GMP) with pre-release lot testing for safety and
potency. This evaluation usually occurs in parallel to the
clinical trials prior to vaccine licensure. To further assure
safety, it is also critical that staff administering
immunizations receive training in appropriate vaccine
storage, handling, and safe injection practices.
Passive Surveillance.
(Spontaneous Reporting System)
Informal or formal passive surveillance or spontaneous
reporting system (SRS) has been the cornerstone of most
vaccine safety monitoring systems because of their relative
low cost of operations. National reporting of vaccine
adverse events can be done through the same reporting
channels as those used for other adverse drug reactions.
Vaccine manufacturers also maintain SRS for their
products, which are usually forwarded subsequently to
appropriate national authorities.
Due to the importance of infectious disease control,
vaccines are purchased and administered by national
public health authorities. For example, in the public sector
(for example HCFA and local governments) coordinate
their programs with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). The CDC purchases and distributes
over half of the childhood vaccines administered in the
United States. The FDA licenses and regulates vaccines,
and collaborates with CDC in the development of vaccine
adverse event reporting systems.

The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
(VAERS)
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986,
mandated that 1) health care workers who administer
vaccines, and 2) licensed vaccine manufactures, report
certain adverse health events following specific
vaccinations. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting
System (VAERS), jointly administered by the CDC and
FDA, was created in 1990 to provide a unified national
effort for the collection of all reports of clinically
significant adverse events. The creation of VAERS also
provided an opportunity to correct some shortcomings of
the predecessor CDC Monitoring System for Adverse
Events Following Immunizations (MSAEFI) and FDA's
Adverse Drug Reaction.
The VAERS reporting form is designed to allow a narrative
description of adverse events. Because VAERS is an open
reporting system, all persons, including patients, their
parents (who submit <5% of VAERS reports) and health
professionals, can report adverse events to VAERS. There
are no restrictions on onset intervals or requirements for
medical care. Annually VAERS forms are sent to
approximately 200,000 physicians in the specialties of
pediatrics, family practice, general practice, internal
medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, and emergency medicine.
Copies are also sent to state health departments and to
public clinics that administer vaccines. Information
sought on the VAERS report includes the vaccine received,
the timing of the vaccination in relation to the onset of
adverse events, demographic information about the
recipient, information about concurrent to medical
illnesses or medications, and past history of adverse
events after vaccination. The form is preaddressed and
postage-paid so that after completion it can be folded and
mailed. To request a VAERS form, assistance in
completing the form, or answers to other questions
about the reporting system, call 1-800-822-7967.
To increase government efficiency, VAERS operations are
partially “privatized.” A contractor, under CDC and FDA
supervision, distributes, collects, codes [using the Coding
Symbols for a Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms
(COSTART)] and enters VAERS reports in a database. A
verification-of-receipt letter, bearing the assigned VAERS
identification number is returned to the reporter.
Reporters of selected serious events receive written
requests from VAERS (60 days after vaccination and one
year after vaccination) for information about the patient's
recovery. Reporters may also submit additional relevant
information to the VAERS by using the assigned
identification number. Both the CDC and FDA have on-line
computer access to the VAERS database and focus their



## p. 283 (#295) ############################################

efforts on analytical tasks of interest to their respective
agencies. These data (without personal identifiers) are also
available to the public. Since VAERS' inception,
approximately 10,000 reports have been received annually,
~20% of which are defined as serious (death, disability, etc.)
Due to this volume, follow up by a health professional
currently occurs on all reports of deaths and only selected
serious events of interest. VAERS has successfully met its
design goal as a sentinel for changes in rates of known
adverse events (e.g., GBS after influenza vaccination), as
well as previously-unknown vaccine reactions (e.g., alopecia
after hepatitis B vaccine).
Classifications, case definitions
and evaluative protocols
Vaccine reactions can be classified by frequency (common,
rare), extent (local, systemic), severity (hospitalization,
disability, death), causality, and preventability (intrinsic to
vaccine, faulty production, faulty administration). A
recent classification divides vaccine adverse events as
follows:
1. Vaccine-induced: due to the intrinsic characteristic of
the vaccine preparation and the individual response of the
vaccinee, these events would not have occurred without
vaccination (e.g., vaccine-associated paralytic
poliomyelitis).
2. Vaccine-potentiated: the event would have occurred
anyway, but was precipitated by the vaccination (e.g., first
febrile seizure in a predisposed child).
3. Programmatic error: due to technical errors in vaccine
preparation, handling, or administration.
4. Coincidental: the event was associated temporally with
vaccination (e.g., by chance occurence or due to underlying
illness).
To further improve the quality of SRS data and maximize
its utility as a registry of rare potential vaccine reactions,
standard protocols for the clinical evaluation of selected
serious events reported to VAERS (e.g., deaths, seizures)
are under development. Such protocols could then be sent
to the health care providers who report such events in
order to standardize the evaluation of these patients.

Assessment of causality
It is natural to suspect a vaccine to be the cause when an
adverse event occurs following vaccination, but in reality a
causal association may or may not exist. Temporal
association does not prove causation. Information used for
assessing causality in individual case reports includes: a)
previous general experience with vaccine; b) alternative
etiologies; c) susceptibility of the vaccinee; d) timing of
events; e) characteristic of the event (e.g., confirmatory
laboratory findings); f) dechallenge; g) rechallenge
When it is established that a particular vaccine can cause a
specific adverse reaction the next question is: what is the
probability that an individual will experience the reaction,
or what proportion of the vacinated population will
experience it (i.e., what is the attributable risk)? This
information is critical for risk-benefit considerations.
Another approach to causality that minimizes controversy
is to assume that adverse events that occur within a
particular period after vaccinations are caused by the
vaccine, irrespective of whether they were truly causal or
just coincidental. This approach to causality is used in
some vaccine injury compensation programs to simplify
the proceedings. Classifications are based on the reported
symptoms, the interval between vaccination and onset of
symptoms, and a set of case definitions.
Usually, causal link between the vaccine and an adverse
event can be established if there is 1) an unique laboratory
diagnostic result (e.g., viral culture in patient with adverse
event and genetic sequencing showing virus is a vaccine
and not a wild strain); 2) an unique clinical syndrome (e.g.,
acute flaccid paralysis classical for polio occurring shortly
after receipt of oral polio vaccine in setting where wild
polio virus circulation is unlikely); or 3) an epidemiologic
study showing vaccinated person are more likely than
unvaccinated person to experience the adverse event.
Unfortunately, very few VAERS reports meet either
criteria 1) or 2). Since VAERS reports come from just
vaccinated persons with adverse events, they represent
just cell “a” of such a “2 x 2" table needed for an
epidemiologic study. The information needed to complete
the other 3 cells are usually missing. This explains in part
the relative lack of knowledge regarding vaccine safety
found by the IOM and the value of Large Linked Data
Bases (LLDB's) for studying vaccine safety since all the
data to complete this table are readily available via this
approach.


## p. 285 (#297) ############################################

VACCINE SAFETY 285
Large-Linked Databases (LLDB)
Historically, when a signal of a potential vaccine safety
concern was generated from passive surveillance, ad hoc
epidemiologic studies were needed to test this hypothesis.
Such ad hoc studies, while potentially informative about
vaccine causality, were costly, time-consuming, and usually
limited to assessment of a single event. The need to
improve post-licensure monitoring of drug safety became
widely recognized following the thalidomide disaster.
Faced with methodology limitations in passive
surveillance for drug adverse events,
pharmacoepidemiologists during the 1980s began to turn
to large databases linking computerized pharmacy
prescription (and later, immunization records) and
computerized medical outcomes (e.g., hospitalization)
records. These LLDBs are derived from defined
populations such as members of health maintenance
organizations (HMOs), single-provider health care
systems, and Medicaid programs. As these databases are
usually generated in the routine administration of such
programs and do not require completion of a vaccine
adverse event reporting form, the problems of under-
reporting or recall bias are reduced. Therefore, LLDBs
can potentially provide an economical and rapid to means
of conducting post licensure studies of safety of drugs and
vaccines. CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project is
one example of such a LLDB. It links the immunization
and medical records on members of four HMO's, totalling
2% of the US population for various vaccine safety studies.
Vaccine Risk Communication
Disease prevention, especially when it requires high
compliance by the population, is a difficult task. In the
pre-immunization era, vaccine preventable diseases like
measles and pertussis were so widespread that the risks
and benefits of disease versus vaccination were readily
evident. As immunization programs successfully reduced
the incidence of disease, an increasing number of health
care providers and parents, have had little or no personal
experience with these diseases. For their risk benefit
analysis, these individuals are forced to rely on history,
and other more “distant” descriptions of these diseases in
textbooks or educational brochures. In contrast, what is
visible is the degree of very personal discomfort and pain
associated with each immunization.
Other social factors also mitigate against timely
vaccination, for example, biased and inaccurate reporting
by controversy-seeking media, increasing popularity of
“alternative” medicine, and inaccurate information
relating to vaccines posted on the Internet and in some
books. Because of these factors the art of handling vaccine

- uncertainty - patient rely on advice of

safety concerns and vaccine risk communications has
emerged as an increasingly important skill for clinicians
and for managers of immunization programs.
Risk communication principles
The science of risk communication was developed initially
to address public concerns in areas of technology and
environmental risks. Some key principles and lessons
include the following: 1) individuals differ in their
perceptions of risk depending on their personality,
education, and life experience, 2) perceptions of risk may
differ dramatically, depending on the person's perspective
(e.g., as a public health employee, vaccine industry
representative, alternative medicine practitioner, average
parent, or parent of a vaccine-injured child); 3) “voluntary”
risks (e.g., driving a car) are usually more acceptable than
involuntary risks (e.g., mandated immunizations); risk
comparison examples used for educational purposes that
fail to take the degree of voluntariness into account can
back fire and create anger. 4) many persons have an
“omission bias” in that they prefer the consequences of
inaction (not receiving vaccinations) to action (receiving
vaccinations); 5) patients frequently rely on the advice of
their physician or other health care professional for
guidance about risks and benefits of vaccination.
In the U.S., distribution of information, developed by the
CDC, about the risks and benefits of immunizations has
been required in the public sector since 1978. Distribution
of such material in both private and public sectors has
been required since 1988. Recent efforts have been
devoted toward the use of focus groups and other research
to assess and improve the effectiveness of such
information material.
In many countries including the U.S., persons who believe
that they or their children have been injured by vaccines
have organized to distribute information that highlights
the risks of and uncertainties related to immunizations
through the Internet and various publications. Materials
to address these misconceptions and allegations about
immunizations are developed and distributed to state
immunization programs as they arise. The National
Immunization Hotline (800) 232-2522, the National
Immunization Program Web Page (www.cdc.gov/nip) and
the CDC publication entitled 6 Common Misconceptions
about Vaccination and How to Respond to Them (see
Appendix F) are also good resources for parents and
health care providers who have questions about vaccine
safety. In the future, we will need to: 1) create better
systems to develop and disseminate vaccine safety
materials to immunization providers in a timely manner,



## p. (#299) ################################################

VACC/WE SAFETY
and 2) develop historically based materials that express
the impact outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases have
had on the death and disability of countless individuals
and families.
Risk communication can be used for the purposes of
advocacy, public education, or decision-making
partnership. People care not only about the magnitude of
the risk, but also how the risks are managed and whether
they participate in the risk management process,
especially in a democratic society. Receiving a vaccination
is unlike most other medical procedures (e.g., surgery), in
that the consequences of the decision affect not only the
individual, but also others in the society. Because of this
important distinction, many countries have enacted public
health (e.g., immunization) laws that severely limit any
individual's right to infect others. Some persons may
attempt to avoid the risks of vaccination while being
protected by the group (or herd) immunity, which results
from others being vaccinated. The protection provided by
herd immunity may disappear if too many persons avoid
vaccination, which may result in tragic outbreaks of
diseases. Recent debates in the U.S. have focused on
whether philosophical (in addition to medical and
religious) exemptions to mandatory immunizations should
be allowed more universally, and if so, what standards for
claims of exemption are needed. Vaccine risk
communications should discuss the risks and benefits of
specific vaccines, and should also inform persons receiving
vaccinations about the delicate balance between societal
and individual rights in a shared community.
Evaluating and Managing Vaccine Safety
Concerns
Healthy doses of empathy, patience, and scientific
skepticism, are all needed to effectively address vaccine
safety concerns from a clinical perspective. As with all
investigations, the first step is objective and
comprehensive data gathering with an open mind.
Premature dismissal of new vaccine safety concerns as
“unfounded” without gathering and weighing the evidence
is unwise and unscientific.
Periodically, vaccine safety concerns may emerge in the
media. Because media frequently aims to present both
sides of the story as equal in impact and importance, the
challenge for health care professionals is to establish
greater credibility to the audience. Factors that aid in
such credibility include scientific expertise, relationship
with media on prior difficult issues, empathy, and ability to
distill scientific facts and figures down to easily
understood concepts for persons who may not have

' This schedule indicates the recommended ages for routine administration of currently licensed childhood vaccines. Combination vaccines may be used
whenever any components of the combination are indicated and its other components are not contraindicated. Providers should consult the manufacturers'
package inserts for detailed recommendations.
* Infants born to HBs.Ag-negative mothers should receive the 2nd dose of hepatitis B (Hep B) vaccine at least one month after the 1st dose. The 3rd dose
should be administered at least 4 months after the 1st dose and at least 2 months after the 2nd dose, but not before 6 months of age for infants.
Infants born to HBs.Ag-positive mothers should receive hepatitis B vaccine and 0.5 mL hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth at
separate sites. The 2nd dose is recommended at 1-2 months of age and the 3rd dose at 6 months of age.
Infants born to mothers whose HBs.Ag status is unknownshould receive hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. Maternal blood should be drawn at the
time of delivery to determine the mother's HBSAg status; if the HBs.Ag test is positive, the infant should receive HBIG as soon as possible (no later than 1 week
of age).
All children and adolescents (through 18 years of age) who have not been immunized against hepatitis B may begin the series during any visit. Special efforts
should be made to immunize children who were born in or whose parents were born in areas of the world with moderate or high endemicity of hepatitis B virus
infection.
DTaP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine) is the preferred vaccine for all doses in the immunization series, including completion of
the series in children who have received 1 or more doses of whole-cell DTP vaccine. Whole-cell DTP is an acceptable alternative to DTaP. The 4th dose (DTP
or DTaP) may be administered as early as 12 months of age, provided 6 months have elapsed since the 3rd dose and if the child is unlikely to return at age
15-18 months. To (tetanus and diphtheria toxoids) is recommended at 11-12 years of age if at least 5 years have elapsed since the last dose of DTP, DTaP or
DT. Subsequent routine To boosters are recommended every 10 years.
* Three Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines are licensed for infant use. If PRP-OMP (PedvaxH|Bor ComWaxeſ Merck]) is administered at 2
and 4 months of age, a dose at 6 months is not required. Because clinical studies in infants have demonstrated that using some combination products may
induce a lower immune response to the Hib vaccine component, DTaP/Hib combination products should not be used for primary immunization in infants at 2, 4
or 6 months of age, unless FDA-approved for these ages.
5 Two poliovirus vaccines currently are licensed in the United States: inactivated poliovirus (IPV) vaccine and oral poliovirus (OPV) vaccine.
The ACIP, AAP and AAFP now recommend that the first two doses of poliovirus vaccine should be IPV. The ACIP continues to recommend a sequential
schedule of two doses of IPV administered at ages 2 and 4 months, followed by two doses of OPV at 12-18 months and 4-6 years. Use of IPV for all doses also
is acceptable and is recommended for immunocompromised persons and their household contacts.
OPV is no longer recommended for the first two doses of the schedule and is acceptable only for special circumstances such as: children of parents who do not
accept the recommended number of injections, late initiation of immunization which would require an unacceptable number of injections, and imminent travel to
polio-endemic areas. OPV remains the vaccine of choice for mass immunization campaigns to control outbreaks due to wild poliovirus.
6 Rotavirus (RV) vaccine is shaded and italicized to indicate: 1) health-care providers may require time and resources to incorporate this new vaccine into practice;
and 2) the AAFP feels that the decision to use rotavirus vaccine should be made by the parent or guardian in consultation with their physician or other health
care provider. The first dose of Rw vaccine should not be administered before 6 weeks of age, and the minimum interval between doses is 3 weeks. The RV
vaccine series should not be initiated at 7 months of age or older, and all doses should be completed by the first birthday.
7 The 2nd dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended routinely at 4-6 years of age but may be administered during any visit, provided

If initiated in the first year of life, administer DTaP doses 1, 2, and 3 and OPV doses 1, 2, and 3
according to this schedule; administer MMR and varicella when the child reaches 12-15 months of age.
All vaccines should be administered simultaneously at the appropriate visit.
See individual ACIP recommendations for detailed information on specific vaccines.
Diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) is preferred for all doses of the
series. A vaccine containing whole-cell pertussis vaccine is an acceptable alternative.
OPV is no longer recommended for the first two doses of the schedule and is acceptable only for special
circumstances such as: children of parents who do not accept the recommended number of injections,
late initiation of immunization which would require an unacceptable number of injections, and imminent
travel to polio-endemic areas.
Recommended Hib schedule varies by vaccine manufacturer and age of the child when vaccination
series is started. If series is begun at ~6 months of age, 4 doses are needed (only 3 doses are needed if
all doses are PRP-OMP [PedvaxHIB", Merck]). The fourth dose must be 22 months after the third dose
and on or after the first birthday. If series started at age 7-11 months, 3 doses are needed with the third
dose 22 months after the second dose and on or after the first birthday. If series started at age 12-14
months, 2 doses are needed, 22 months apart. If series started at age 215 months, one dose of any
licensed conjugate Hib vaccine is recommended.

After the Shots...
What to do if your child has discomfort
Your child may need extra love and care after getting immunized. Many of the
shots that protect children from serious diseases can also cause discomfort for
a while. Here are answers to questions many parents have about the fussiness,
fever, and pain their children may experience after they have been immunized.
If you don't find the answers to your questions, call the clinic!
My clinic phone number:
Shots may hurtalittle...
butthe disease can hurta lot!
My child has been fussy since you immunized him/her. What should I do?
After immunization, children may be fussy due to pain and/or fever. You may want to give
your child acetaminophen, a medicine that helps to reduce pain and fever. Some ex-
amples of acetaminophen are Tylenol, Panadol, and Tempra. DO NOT GIVE ASPIRIN.
See chart below. If the fussiness lasts for more than 24 hours, you should call the clinic.
My child's arm (or leg) is swollen, hot, and red. What should I do?
• A clean, cool washcloth may be applied over the sore area as needed for comfort.
• If there is increasing redness or tenderness after 24 hours, call the clinic.
• For pain, give acetaminophen. See chartbelow. DO NOT GIVE ASPIRIN.
I think my child has a fever. What should I do?
Check your child's temperature to find out if there is a fever. The most accurate way to do
this is by taking a rectal temperature. (Be sure to use a lubricant, such as petroleum jelly,
when doing so.) If your child's fever is 105°For higher by rectum, you need to call the
clinic.
If you take the temperature by mouth (for an older child) or under the arm, these tem-
peratures are generally lower and may be less accurate. Call your clinic if you are con-
cerned about these temperatures.
Here are some things you can do to reduce fever:
• Give your child plenty to drink.
• Clothe your child lightly. Do not cover or wrap your child tightly!
• Give your child acetaminophen. DO NOTUSEASPIRIN.
• Sponge your child in a few inches of lukewarm (not cold!) bath water.
My child seems really sick. Should I call the doctor?
If you are worried ATALL about how your child looks or feels, please call the
clinic!

1998 data are provisional.
Prior to 1966, hepatitis A and B were not separated from other types of
hepatitis. Prior to 1978, deaths from hepatitis A and B were not separated from
deaths from other types of hepatitis.
Haemophilus reporting includes all serotypes.
Varicella was taken off the nationally notifiable disease list in 1991.
Many
states continue to report these cases to CDC.
Polio reporting may not reflect changes based on retrospective case evaluations
or late reports. Since 1975, paralytic polio case count is based on medical
consultant record reviews of cases reported to CDC.

MCV: measles-containing vaccine
Var: varicella vaccine
Data prior to 1993 were collected by the National Health Interview
Survey and represent 2-year-old children. Data from 1993 are from the
National Immunization Survey and represent 19-35-month-old children.
Different methods were used for the two surveys.
Combined 4-3-1 : Four or more doses of DTP/DTaP/DT, three or more doses
of poliovirus vaccine, and one or more doses of any measles-containing
vaccine.
Combined 4-3-1-3: Four or more doses of DTP/DTaP/DT, three or more
doses of poliovirus vaccine, one or more doses of any measles-
containing vaccine, and three or more doses of Haemophilus influenzae
type b vaccine.

Ideally, immunizations should be given as part of comprehensive child health care.
This is the ultimate goal toward which the nation must strive if all of America's
children are to benefit from the best primary disease prevention our health care
system has to offer.
Overall improvement in our primary care delivery system requires intensive effort
and will take time. However, we should not wait for changes in this system before
providing immunizations more effectively to our children. Current health care
policies and practices in all settings result in the failure to deliver vaccines on
schedule to many of our vulnerable preschool-aged children. This failure is due
primarily to barriers that impede vaccine delivery and to missed opportunities
during clinic visits. Changes in policies and practices can immediately improve
coverage. The present system should be geared to "user-friendly," family-centered,
culturally sensitive, and comprehensive primary health care that can provide
rapid, efficient, and consumer-oriented services to the users, i.e., children and
their parents. The failure to do so is evidenced by the recent resurgence of
measles and measles-related childhood mortality, which may be an omen of other
vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks.
Present childhood immunization practices must be changed if we wish to protect
the nation's children and immunize 90% of two-year-olds by the year 2000.
The following standards for pediatric immunization practices address these issues.
These standards are recommended for use by all health professionals in the public
and private sector who administer vaccines to or manage immunization services
for infants and children. These Standards represent the most desirable
immunization practices which health care providers should strive to achieve to the
extent possible. By adopting these Standards, providers can begin to enhance
and change their own policies and practices. It is recognized that not all providers
will have the funds necessary to fully implement the Standards immediately.
Nevertheless, those providers and programs lacking the resources to implement
the Standards fully should find them a useful tool in better delineating
immunization needs and in obtaining additional resources in the future in order to
achieve the Healthy People 2000 immunization objective.

Sfandards for Pediatric Immunization Practices
DiSCUSSOIn
Immunization services dre reddily dvailable.
Immunization services should be responsive to the needs of patients. For
example, in large urban areas, public immunization clinic services should
be available daily, 8 hours per day. In smaller cities and rural areas,
clinics may operate less frequently. To be fully responsive, providers in
many locations should consider offering immunization services each working day as well
as during some off-hours (e.g., weekends, evenings, early mornings, or lunch-hours).
Immunization services should be considered for all days and at all hours that other child
health services in the same site are offered (e.g., Special Supplemental Food Program for
Women, Infants, and Children, [WIC]). Private providers who offer primary care to
infants and children should always include immunization services as a routine part of
that care.
Ready availability of immunization services also requires that the supply of vaccines be
adequate at all times.
There dre no barriers or unnecessary prerequisites to
the receipt of voccines.
Appointment-only systems often serve as barriers to immunization in
both public and private settings. Thus, immunization services should also
be available on a walk-in basis at all times for both routine and new
enrollee visits. Waiting time should be minimized and generally not exceed 30 minutes.
Furthermore, administration of needed vaccines should not be contingent on enrollment in
a well-baby program unless enrollment is immediately available. Children presenting
only for immunizations should be rapidly and efficiently screened without requiring other
comprehensive health services. However, children receiving immunizations in such an
"express lane" fashion and found not to have a primary care provider should be referred to
One.
Physical examinations and temperature measurements prior to immunization should not
be required if they delay or impede the timely receipt of immunizations (e.g., appoint-
ments for physical examination in some facilities may take weeks to months). A reliable
decision to vaccinate can be based exclusively on the information elicited from a parent or
guardian and on the provider's observations and judgment about the child's wellness at
the time of vaccination. At a minimum, children should have pre-immunization assess-




## p. (#348) ################################################

ments, including a) observing the child's general state of health, b) asking the parent or
guardian if the child is well, and c) questioning the parent or guardian about potential
contraindications (see attached table).
In public clinic settings, the administration of vaccines should not be dependent on
individual written orders or on a referral from a primary care provider. Rather, standing
orders should be developed and implemented.
Immunization Services dre CVClildble free or for d
minimdl fee.
In the public sector, immunizations should be free of charge. If fees must
be collected, they should be kept to a minimum. In the private sector,
charges should include the cost of the vaccine, and a reasonable
administration fee. Affordable vaccinations will limit the fragmentation of care and help
assure the immunization of the greatest number of children. Public and private providers
charging a fee to administer vaccines obtained through a consolidated federal contract
should prominently display a state approved sign indicating that no one will be denied
immunization services because of inability to pay the fee.
Providers utilize Cill clinicci encounters to screen for
needed voccines Cind, when indicoted, immunize
children.
Each encounter with a health care provider, including an emergency room
visit or hospitalization, is an opportunity to screen the immunization
status and, if indicated, administer needed vaccines. Before discharge from the hospital,
children should receive immunizations for which they are eligible by age and/or health
status. The child's regular health care provider should be informed about the
immunizations administered. Implementation of this standard minimizes the number of
missed opportunities to vaccinate.
In addition, children accompanying parents or siblings who are seeking any service should
also be screened and, when indicated, given needed vaccines.
Providers in subspecialty clinics (e.g., oncology) who care for children should pay
particular attention to the immunization status of their patients and vaccinate or refer
them to immunization services or primary health care providers as appropriate.




## p. (#349) ################################################

Providers in other specialties should also note the immunization status of children and
refer or immunize as appropriate.

Providers educate porents and guardians about
immunization in general terms.
Providers should educate parents and guardians in a culturally sensitive
way, preferably in their own language, about the importance of
immunizations, the diseases they prevent, the recommended
immunization schedules, the need to receive immunizations at recommended ages and the
importance of bringing their child's immunization record to each visit. Parents should be
encouraged to take responsibility for ensuring that their child completes the full series.
Providers should answer all questions parents and guardians may have and provide
appropriate educational materials at suitable reading levels in pertinent languages.
Providers question parents or guardians about
confraindications and, before immunizing a child,
inform them in specific terms dbout the risks dnd
benefits of the immunizdtions their child is to
receive.
Minimal acceptable screening procedures for precautions and contraindications include
asking questions to elicit a possible history of adverse events following prior
immunizations and determining any existing precautions or contraindications (see
attached table).
The Vaccine Information Pamphlets (required by regulation' to be used universally
beginning April 15, 1992 for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis
and Polio by all providers administering vaccine purchased from the federal contract)
should be provided and reviewed with parents or guardians. Private physicians who
purchase their own vaccines must use these pamphlets or must develop and use
alternative vaccine information materials that meet all the requirements of the law.
Similar information contained in the Important Information Statements for other vaccines
(e.g., hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b) should be provided to all parents or
guardians in public clinics and use of these statements should be considered by private
providers. Providers should ensure that information materials are current and available
in appropriate languages. Providers should ask parents or guardians if they have

Regulations Part 110

questions about what they have read and should ensure that they receive satisfactory
answers to their questions.
Providers should explain where and how to obtain medical care during day- and night-
time hours in case of an adverse event following vaccination.
Providers follow only true confraindications.
Accepting conditions which are not true contraindications as being true
contraindications (see attached table) often results in the needless
deferment of indicated immunizations. The attached table of true
contraindications is based on the recommendations of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the recommendations of the Committee
on Infectious Diseases (Red Book Committee) of the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP). Sometimes these recommendations may vary from those contained in the
manufacturer's package inserts. For more detailed information, providers should consult
the published recommendations of the ACIP, the AAP, the American Academy of Family
Physicians (AAFP), and the manufacturer's package inserts.
Providers dominister simultaneously dil voccine
doses for which a child is eligible at the time of
edch visit.
Available evidence suggests that the simultaneous administration of
childhood immunizations is safe and effective. In addition, evidence
suggests that the simultaneous administration of multiple needed vaccines can potentially
raise immunization coverage by 9%-17%. If providers elect not to administer a needed
vaccine simultaneously with others (based either on their judgment that this action will
not compromise the timely immunization of the child or on a request by the parent or
guardian), they should document such actions and the reasons why the vaccine was not
administered. The record should be flagged with an automatic recall for an appointment
to receive the needed vaccine(s). This next appointment should be discussed with the
parent or guardian of the child.
Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine should always be used in combined form when
providing routine childhood immunizations.
Providers use docurate and complete recording
procedures.
Providers are required by statute to record, what vaccine was given, the
date the vaccine was given (month, day, year), the name of the
manufacturer of the vaccine, the lot number, the signature and title of the





## p. (#351) ################################################

person who gave the vaccine, and the address where the vaccine was given.” In addition,
providers should record on the child's personal immunization record card (preferably the
official state version) what vaccine was given, the date the vaccine was given and the
name of the provider. Providers should encourage parents or guardians to maintain a
copy of their child's personal immunization record card. This card should be updated at
each visit for immunizations. If a parent fails to bring their child's card, a new one
should be issued containing all previous immunizations and designated as a replacement
record card. When accepting immunization record data from parents, providers should
confirm that prior doses of vaccines have actually been administered, either by reviewing
immunization record cards or by contacting former providers and entering this verified
information onto their records. When a provider who does not routinely vaccinate or care
for a child administers a vaccine to that child, the regular provider should be informed.
Providers with manual record-keeping systems should maintain separate or easily
retrievable files of the immunization records of preschoolers to facilitate assessment of
coverage as well as the identification and recall of children who miss appointments. In
addition, preschooler immunization files should be sorted periodically, with inactive
records placed into a separate file. Providers should indicate in their records, or in an
appropriately identified place, all primary care services that each child receives in order to
facilitate co-scheduling with other services.
Providers co-schedule immunization appointments
in conjunction with appointments for other child
hedlth services.
Providers of immunization-only services which require an appointment
should co-schedule immunization appointments with other needed health
care services such as WIC, dental exams or developmental screening provided such
scheduling does not create a barrier by delaying needed immunizations.
Providers report adverse events following
immunization promptly, dccurately and completely.
Providers should encourage parents or legal guardians to inform them of
adverse events following immunization. Providers should report all such
clinically significant events, including those required by law, to the
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), regardless of whether or not they
believe the events are caused by the vaccines. Report forms and assistance are available
by calling 1-800-822-7967. Providers should document fully the adverse event in the
medical record at the time of the event or as soon as possible thereafter.
*42 US Code 300aa-25




## p. (#352) ################################################

Providers operate d fracking system.
A tracking system should produce reminders of upcoming immunizations
as well as recalls for children who are overdue. A system may be
automated or manual and may include mailed or telephone messages. In
the public sector, health department staff may also make home visits. All
providers should identify, for additional intensive tracking efforts, children considered at
high risk of failing to complete the immunization series on schedule (e.g., children who
start their series late).
Providers dohere to dppropriote procedures for
vaccine management.
Vaccines should be handled and stored as recommended in the
manufacturer's package inserts. The temperatures at which vaccines are
stored and transported should be monitored daily and the expiration date
for each vaccine should be noted.
Providers using publicly purchased vaccine should periodically report usage, wastage, loss
and inventory as required by state or local public health authorities.
Providers conduct Semi-Gnnudl audits to ossess
immunization coverage levels and to review
immunization records in the potient populations
they serve.
In both the public and private sector, the assessment of immunization services for pre-
school-aged patients should include audits of immunization records or inspection of a
random sample of records (1) to determine the immunization coverage level (i.e., the
percentage of children that are up-to-date by their second birthday), (2) to identify how
frequently opportunities for simultaneous immunization are missed and (3) to assess the
quality of documentation. The results of such assessments should be discussed by
providers as part of their ongoing quality assurance reviews and used to develop solutions
to the problems identified.





## p. (#353) ################################################

Providers mdinfoin up-to-date, edsily retrievable
medical profocols of dll locotions where vaccines
dre doministered.
Providers administering vaccines should maintain a protocol which, at a
minimum, discusses the appropriate vaccine dosage, vaccine
contraindications, the recommended sites and techniques for vaccine administration as
well as possible adverse events and their emergency management. Such protocols should
specify the necessary emergency medical equipment, drugs (including dosage) and
personnel to safely and competently deal with any medical emergency which may arise
after the administration of a vaccine. All providers should be familiar with the content of
these protocols, their location and how to follow them. Vaccines can be administered in
any setting (e.g., schools, churches) where providers can adhere to these protocols.
Providers proctice patient-oriented and community-
1 6 based dpprodches.
- - Public providers should routinely seek the input of their patients on
specific approaches to better serve their immunization needs and
implement the changes necessary to provide more user-friendly services.
Public providers should adopt a community-based approach to the provision of
immunization services which calls for reaching high coverage levels in their catchment
area populations and not only in the active patient populations they serve. Such a
community-based approach requires all public providers to publicize the availability of
their immunization services and to conduct community outreach activities to increase
demand for immunization services. Private providers should cooperate with local health
officials in their efforts to assure high coverage levels throughout the community.
Without high immunization coverage levels, no community is completely protected against
vaccine-preventable diseases. All providers share in the responsibility to achieve the
highest possible degree of community protection.
Voccines are doministered by properly frained
individuCils.
Only properly trained individuals should administer vaccines. However,
the task of administering vaccines need not be assigned exclusively to
physicians and nurses. With appropriate training, including the
management of emergency situations, and under professional supervision, other personnel
can skillfully and safely administer vaccines. In some jurisdictions, statutory
requirements may limit the administration of vaccines to licensed physicians and/or




## p. (#354) ################################################

nurses which could therefore create barriers to immunization. If so, legal opinion should
be sought locally to determine the necessary steps to overcome this barrier.
Providers receive ongoing education dnd fraining
on current immunizCition recommendotions.
Providers include all individuals who are involved in the administration
of vaccines, the management of immunization clinics, or the support of
these functions. Training and education should cover current guidelines
and recommendations of the ACIP, AAP and the AAFP as well as the Standards for
Immunization Practices and other immunization information sources such as the
manufacturer's package inserts. Providers should also receive information about ongoing
national efforts to reach the year 2000 goal of 90% series complete immunization by the
second birthday.

'The events or conditions listed as precautions, although not contraindications, should be carefully reviewed. The benefits and risks of administering
a specific vaccine to an individual under the circumstances should be considered. If the risks are believed to outweigh the benefits, the immunization
should be withheld; if the benefits are believed to outweigh the risks (for example, during an outbreak or foreign travel), the immunization should be
given. Whether and when to administer DTP/DTaP to children with proven or suspected underlying neurologic disorders should be decided on an
individual basis. Avoiding administration of certain vaccines to pregnant women is prudent on theoretical grounds. If immediate protection against
poliomyelitis is needed, either OPV or IPV is recommended.
*Acetaminophen given prior to administering DTP/DTaP and thereafter every 4 hours for 24 hours should be considered for children with a personal

*The decision to give additional doses of DTP/DTaP should be based on consideration of the benefit of further vaccination vs. the risk of recurrence
of GBS. For example, completion of the primary series in children is justified.

“Measles vaccination may temporarily suppress tuberculin reactivity. MMR vaccine may be given after, or on the same day as, TB testing. If MMR
has been given recently, pospone the TB test until 4-6 weeks after administration of MMR. If giving MMR simultaneously with tuberculin skin test,
use the Mantoux test and not multiple puncture tests, because the latter require confirmation if positive, which would have to be postponed 4-6
weeks.
*The decision to vaccinate should be based on consideration of the benefits of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella vs. the risk of recurrence or
exacerbation of thrombocytopenia following vaccination, or from natural infections of measles or rubella. In most instances, the benefits of
vaccination will be much greater than the potential risks and justify giving MMR, particularly in view of the even greater risk of thrombocytopenia
following measles or rubella disease. However, if a prior episode of thrombosytopenia occurred in close temporal proximity to vaccination, it might
be prudent to avoid a subsequent dose.
“Recent data suggest that most anaphylactic reactions to measles- and mumps-containing vaccines are associated with hypersensitivity not to egg
antigens but to other components of the vaccines. Because the risk of anaphylactic reactions after administration of measles- or mumps-containing
vaccines in persons who are allergic to eggs is extremely low and skin testing with vaccine is not predictive of allergic reactions to these vaccines,
skin testing and desensitization are no longer required before administration of MMR vaccine to persons who are allergic to eggs.

when administered separately 230 days apart.
*Varicella vaccine should not be given for at least 5 months after administration of blood (except washed red blood cells), or plasma tranfusions,
immune globulin, or VZIG. Immune globulin or VZIG should not be given for 3 weeks following vaccination unless the benefits exceed those of the
vaccination. In such cases, the vaccinee should either be revaccinated 5 months later or tested for immunity 6 months later and revaccinated if
seronegative.
*Varicella vaccine should not be given to a member of a household with a family history of immunodeficiency until the immune status of the
recipient and other children in the family is documented.

How to Read a CASA Summary Report: Just for Starters
Introduction
What is CASA?
The Clinic Assessment Software Application, CASA, is a
menu-driven relational database developed by the National
Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), as an assessment tool for immunization
clinics and providers. CASA is used for the data entry and
analysis components of a practice-based vaccination
assessment. It includes reminder and recall tracking capabilities, as well as many other special
features. A CASA assessment can help providers understand their current vaccination coverage
levels and diagnose their immunization delivery system problems. CASA provides an extensive
body of data that can be accessed and organized to suit individual practice needs.
“Just for Starters” is an introduction to reading the CASA Summary Report. More in-depth
materials and training are available from the CDC National Immunization Program.
NOTE WELL: The information in “Just for Starters” refers only to the CASA Summary Report,
NOT to the CASA Diagnostic Report. A copy of a CASA Summary Report is attached.
CASA is constantly evolving. Definitions, vaccine-specific age criteria, and diagnostic
capabilities are continuously being updated to reflect changing ACIP recommendations and user
needs. This is not the last word.
Important Abbreviations and Definitions
Vaccines
DTP In CASA reports, there is no distinction between DTP, DTaP, and DT
Polio In CASA reports, there is no distinction between OPV and IPV.
Hib In CASA reports, there is no distinction between Hib brands.
Though the CASA analyses do not distinguish among the various types, the specific types
of vaccine (e.g., IPV vs. OPV, Hibbrands) can be entered into CASA.
MOGE (pronounced moe-ghee)
Moved Or Going Elsewhere, i.e., there is documentation that the person has moved out of
the jurisdiction or is going elsewhere for services. Documentation of at least one of the
following is required:
- Copies of the child's records were transferred to a new practice.
- A letter was received from another provider that the patient is in a new practice.
o A mailed reminder card/letter was returned by the post office with no forwarding
address.
e The parent/guardian informed the practice of the intent to transfer the child's care
to another primary care provider during a previous office visit, home visit, or
telephone contact.

## p. (#360) ################################################

Date of Assessment
Provider Review Date: the date the assessment was conducted
Common Review Date: When doing assessments for a group of practices, each practice
has its own provider review date. However, when comparing the vaccination levels at the
sites, one review date must be used for all sites — for fairness' sake. That somewhat
arbitrarily chosen, single point in time is called the Common Review Date.
When conducting an assessment for one clinic/provider only, the Provider Review Date
and the Common Review Date are identical. The Common Review Date is what appears
on the CASA Summary Report.
Up-To-Date (UTD)
UTD means “fully vaccinated for age.” The number of doses of each vaccine that a child
needs can be customized by the CASA user to reflect any criteria at any age. As a
default, children are considered UTD if they have received the following number of
vaccines by the ages shown. Please note that only the ages at which criteria change are
shown. For example, the default criteria are the same at 12 months as they are at 7
months, the same at 18 months as at 16 months.
Age Vaccine
(in months)
DTP | Polio || Hib | Hep B MMR
3 1 1 1 1
5 2 2 2 2
7 3 2 2 2
16 4 3 3 3 1
24+ 4 3 3 3 1
*criteria same as 16 months
UTD has two subsets:
(1) UTD at the benchmark ages (either 12 mos or 24 mos)
(2) Late UTD – i.e., UTD at the time of the CASA assessment, but not at the
benchmark age
Missed Opportunities (or Non-Simultaneous Vaccination)
Failure to give all needed vaccines simultaneously on the last vaccination visit.
(There is a special CASA option that allows you to enter non-vaccination visits.
Discussion of this option is beyond the scope of this introduction.)
“Lost” or “Lost to Follow-Up”
Eligible for vaccine, but not seen in the past 12 months
Page 2 of 7



## p. (#361) ################################################

Not Eligible for Vaccine
Not eligible at 24 months because of minimum intervals needed between vaccine doses
Late Start Rates
Failure to begin office-based immunization by 3 months of age.
Late Start rate is calculated as the 9% of infants who do not have one DTP or polio or Hib
vaccine by 3 months of age. The Hepatitis B vaccine given at birth is not counted.
Drop-Off Rates
The drop-off rate measures a sharp decline in DTP status from one age cohort to another.
The Drop-Off Rate is calculated as:
At 24 mos of age = % with DTP1 at 6 mos minus 9% with DTP4 at 24 mos
At 12 mos of age = % with DTP1 at 6 mos minus 9% with DTP3 at 12 mos
CASA Reports Immunization Levels in Several Ways
Please refer to the attached CASA Summary Report.
Not Up-To-Date:
This can be found on the flow chart after the second branching. As the words imply, this
tells how many children in the cohort were missing one or more shots at the time of the
assessment. The goal is to have 10% or less Not Up-To-Date.
UTD Grid and UTD Percentages Graph:
On WINCASA reports, these can be found on the pages after the flow chart.
The UTD Grid shows the 9% of children who were UTD for all needed vaccines by age.
The number of each vaccine needed to be considered Up-To-Date is included in the grid.
The “9% Coverage” column shows the age-specific immunization levels.
The UTD Percentages Graph shows the same data in a graphic format.
UTD by vaccine dose:
CASA also reports the age-specific immunization levels for each specific dose of each
vaccine (e.g., DTP4).
CASA Helps Pinpoint Specific Problems
CASA provides detailed reports on the specific diagnosis of the problem, for example, whether
record-keeping and documentation are adequate, whether children start their series on time,
whether and when patients drop out of the system, whether recall is used effectively, whether
vaccines are given simultaneously. It can also be used to identify specific vaccines (e.g., MMR)
or specific doses of vaccines (e.g., DTP4) that are a problem for the practice. This important
diagnostic capability of CASA facilitates a focused — rather than a “laundry list” — approach to
change at the site.
Although CASA can be used for adolescent and adult practices, the diagnostics capabilities are
currently limited for these groups. Efforts to expand CASA for these groups are underway.

## p. (#362) ################################################

Moved Or Going Elsewhere (MOGE)
This can be found on the flow chart after the first branching. Take the MOGE number
shown and divide it by the number of records reviewed (the very top of the flow chart). If
this is much less than 15% for a 24-month-old cohort, a question arises about the
possibility of poor documentation. Other explanations (e.g., early archiving) are also
possible — ask about these. Usually, a low % MOGE will be accompanied by a high 9%
of children who are eligible for vaccine, but not seen in the past 12 months (i.e., “Lost” or
“Lost to Follow-up”). Note that CASA does not include “MOGE” records in its analyses.
% Missed Opportunities (or Non-Simultaneous Vaccination)
This can be found on the flow chart after the third branching. If this is more than 5%, we
ask why there was a failure to give all needed vaccines simultaneously on the previous
vaccination visit. Good questions include:
e Is there an office policy against:
- simultaneous administration?
- any particular vaccine (e.g., MMR or DTP4)?
- vaccinating at the earliest time (e.g., MMR or DTP4 at 12 mos)?
e Does the whole staff support simultaneous administration? To pinpoint
individuals who do not support simultaneous administration of vaccination, it may
be useful to use a log book in which providers document their reasons for NOT
immunizing simultaneously.
e How are parents approached when several injections are due? Are they subtly
encouraged not to have several vaccines given on the same day? Providers who
are not thoroughly convinced of the merits of simultaneous administration may
give negative messages subconsciously. It may not be WHAT is said, but HOW
it is said that dissuades parents.
e Are parents prepared to expect 3 or 4 inoculations at the next visit? It helps to
say something like, for example, “We want you to come back in 2 months. That’s
Quinn's 6 month birthday -- right before Labor Day. At that visit, he’ll get the
same vaccines as today, plus his last hepatitis B.”
% Not Eligible for Vaccine
This can be found on the flow chart after the 4th branching. It shows the proportion of
children who presented, but could not be vaccinated because the minimal interval
between doses had not elapsed. If this is more than 5-10%, it may be because there are
many patients who start late (see “Late Start Rates” below). However, if the Late Start
Rate is NOT also high, good questions include:
e Do providers follow false contraindications? Note that a high proportion of
children falling behind between DTP1 and DTP2 may indicate use of false
contraindications early in the series.
o Is an effective reminder/recall system used? Note that drop-offs later in the
series are more likely due to general reminder/recall deficiencies. (See “Drop-Off
Rates” below)
e Is the accelerated schedule used?
Page 4 of 7


## p. (#363) ################################################

% Last Visit P= 12 Months Ago (Lost)
This can be found on the flow chart after the last branching. A high 9% of patients who
are eligible for vaccine, but who have not been seen in the past year may mean that there
are many patients who have moved or gone elsewhere for services without
documentation. Good questions include:
e Are appointment notices, reminder messages, and recall messages simply not
arriving?
- Does the clerical staff update the record of each patient’s address and
phone number at every visit?
Are changes in patient addresses & phone numbers regularly exchanged
with other programs (e.g., WIC)?
e If tracking is being done aggressively, is information from the tracking system
making it to the patient’s record? (e.g., if appointment notices are returned with a
“No Forwarding Address” stamp, is that information recorded in the chart?)
e Is there a high Drop-Off Rate, either early or later in the 1st 2 years of life? (See
“Drop-Off Rates” below)
e Is there a high 9% of Late Starts? (See “Late Start Rates” below) Are (managed
care) children who are registered as patients at this facility aware that this is their
primary care site?
Late Start Rates
This can be found on the first page of the summary report, toward the bottom. It
indicates the 9% of children who start at > 3 months. If this is more than 10%, there are 2
main possibilities:
a) many infants are not reporting to the practice within 3 months of birth or
b) many infants who are reporting to the practice within 3 months of birth are not
being vaccinated then.
To determine which it is, you can ask the staff their impressions and/or (if documentation
is good) randomly select a small % of records to determine if there is a high rate of non-
vaccination at the 2 month visit.
If many infants are not reporting by 3 months of age, ask;
© Would the practice’s relationship with the local birthing sites and OB practices
allow prenatal immunization education for parents emphasizing the importance of
a timely first visit?
e Is a postpartum intervention possible? Postpartum interventions range from post
cards and phone calls to new moms to hospital/home visits for “high risk” infants.
e Are (managed care) children who are registered as patients at this facility aware
that this is their primary care site?
If many infants are not being vaccinated at the early visit, ask:
o Are one or more providers following false contraindications (e.g., prematurity,
mild illness)?
Page 5 of 7


## p. (#364) ################################################

Drop-Off Rates
This can be found on the first page of the summary report, toward the bottom and shows
the 9% of children who begin the DTP series, but fail to complete it by 12 or 24 months of
age. If this is more than 10% at either age, good questions include:
e Are there only one or two specific ages at which the problem is most severe?
Sometimes specific interventions can be focused at particular problem times
during the immunization series (e.g., a reminder birthday card at one year,
simultaneous administration of DTP4 with MMR).
e Is an aggressive reminder/recall system in place for all ages and all antigens?
Reminder notices or calls should come to parents before each immunization due
date. Recall messages to families who don’t come in for the visit should start
immediately following the missed visit and should be repeated at varying times of
the day and evening. If a reminder/recall system is in place, is its importance
articulated to parents. In other words, is there parent “buy-in” of the system?
© Are there physical barriers (e.g., long waiting times, long distances to the site,
limited parking) that discourage parents from returning for needed
immunizations? Client-flow observations and adjustments in office hours and
appointment schedules should be considered.
e Are there psychological barriers that discourage parents from returning for
needed immunizations? Non-affirming attitudes of office staff and general
discourtesy can cause parents to procrastinate (or boycott) subsequent
immunization visits. Patient surveys and suggestions boxes are often helpful in
identifying barriers. They also encourage staff to be more responsive to patients.
e Are parents personally informed at each visit what additional vaccine doses are
needed and when they are expected to return to the practice? One-on-one
simple, direct personal communication can enforce the importance of remaining
on schedule and produce a vivid reminder of what is due and when to return. (For
example, a provider might say: “Here are the three points I want you to remember
about returning for immunizations...”)
o Is there non-simultaneous administration of vaccine? (e.g., DTP4 is not given
with MMR)

Common Casa Questions
If a child got NO vaccines at his last office visit because of an invalid contraindication (e.g.,
minor illness), will that be counted as a “Missed Opportunity" on a CASA Summary Report?
No, not if a standard CASA assessment is done because this information would not be
collected. The CASA definition of “Missed Opportunity” (also known as Non-
Simultaneous Vaccination) is “failure to give all needed vaccines simultaneously on the
last vaccination visit.” If a child got NO vaccines at his last office visit because of an
invalid contraindication, CASA would not have a record of that visit at all. The child
would NOT have an apparent “Missed Opportunity.”
It is important to note that the CASA assessment can be modified prior to data entry
and/or the Missed Opportunity Conversation Report can be used to obtain additional
information on missed opportunities.
A child got only one of the recommended vaccines at her first vaccination visit, but at the MOST
RECENT vaccination visit she got all needed vaccines. Will her record be counted as a
“Missed Opportunity?”
Again, not if a standard CASA assessment is done. A “Missed Opportunity” is failure to
give all needed vaccines simultaneously on the last vaccination visit. If a child received
only one of the recommended vaccines at her first vaccination visit, but all the needed
vaccines at the last vaccination visit, CASA would report on the latest visit. The child
would NOT have an apparent “Missed Opportunity.”
If a newborn received Hepatitis B vaccine in the hospital, but did not show up until 4 months of
age at his primary care site, will the record be counted as a Late Start?
Yes. By definition, a Late Start is failure to begin office-based immunization by 3
months of age. Of course, if the first set of DTP, polio, or Hib vaccines is given
anywhere and then recorded in the office record, that is sufficient.
What are the age definitions used in CASA?
Age in months --- 3 5 7 12 15 16 19 24
# of days -- 92 153 214 366 458 488 549 732

with assessment. This video is a great way to introduce health care providers to assessment and feedback.

A Management Self-Assessment
Tool for Providers of Immunization
Services to Young Children
This toolkit contains the Reconnnnended childhood immunization Schedule. United States, January-December 1997
CDC A:.
*:::::::: * Pediatrics




## p. (#376) ################################################

CDC A:.
Dear Colleague.
How often do you remember to check the chart for immunization status when a child appears
for acute or follow-up care? If you don't, you may be missing opportunities to make sure that your
patients are fully immunized.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have produced Make Every Visit Count, a self-
assessment kit that leads to the identification of specific management steps you can use to help
achieve full immunization of the children in your practice.
We have focused Make Every Visit Count on children aged two and younger. While nearly all children
in the United States are fully immunized by school entry, nearly one million children aged two and
younger are not fully immunized.
Many factors contribute to inadequate immunization rates. One is indicated in a 1992 survey of pedia-
tricians and family physicians. Only 28 percent were taking advantage of mild acute illness visits, when
many children could receive vaccines (Pediatrics, Vol. 94, Oct. 94). Thus, the Make Every Visit Count
self-assessment concentrates primarily on screening patients aged two and younger at every visit.
This toolkit contains everything you need: the standards for pediatric immunization practices; the
contraindications to immunization, the recommended vaccine schedule, and the forms that you need
to collect and analyze the data. The vaccine schedule is reviewed and changed, if appropriate, every six
months and this booklet contains the most current version as of the date of printing. Check that it
is still Current.
We have found that the process of collecting and analyzing the information for Make Every Visit
Count takes between two and three person-hours. We urge you to lead your staff in conducting the
self-assessment and to discuss the results with all office staff. Relatively simple changes in office
management procedures, which you identify and implement as a result of using the self-assessment,
have the potential to boost and maintain good immunization rates among the children in your practice.
Two hundred years ago, Edward Jenner gave the first successful vaccination. With your help, we will
meet the year 2000 goal for our nation-complete immunization for at least 90 percent of all children
two years old and younger.

Introduction
| believe that the...
toolkit is generally
well done. The direr-
tions are 31faignt-
forward and easy for
office staff and phys:
c sma to follow. "
* The toolkit was
quite useful and
concise. ”
* I am satisfied with
my immunization
rates, but continue
Nearly a million children aged 2 and under are not appropriately immunized...
some of these children may be your patients.
T he Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) has developed this Make
Every Visit Count kit to help you identify reasons
why children aged two and younger in your
practice may not be fully immunized. While there
are many influences on immunization status, an
important one is the protocol followed in the
physician's office. For example, office procedures
may not routinely include screening for compli-
ance with the immunization schedule at all types
of visits, even though many children can be
safely immunized at acute care, follow-up, or
other visits. The kit suggests office management
steps that address each potential reason for
underimmunization that you identify through
self-assessment.
The Make Every Visit Count
kit can help you.
- Assess how well your office is complying
with the Standards for Pediatric Immunization
Practices
- Identify new opportunities for immunizations
to remind myself and
staff to review immu-
nization status at all
encounters.”
* Suggest practical ways to improve your mmu-
nization practices
In tests of this kit,
more than one-third
of those physicians
who used it reported
that it significantly
changed their immu-
nization practices.
The self-assessment
procedure is straightforward:
1. Screen 30 consecutive children aged 24
months and younger for immunization status
during their next visit (whether acute, follow-up,
emergency, or well child). Use the Individual
Encounter Records on the enclosed pad. Pages
4 and 5 provide instructions and a sample of a
completed form.
2. Analyze the accumulated 30 individual
encounters using the Summary and Analysis on
pages 6 and 7.
3. Consult the Suggestions for Next Steps on
pages 8 and 9 to determine whether there are
improvements that you --
can incorporate into º
your office protocols.
Remember. Your office
staff will assess only
your next 30 visiting
patients aged 24
months and younger—
and each assessment
should require only
a few minutes to
complete.

Standards
"If the provider con-
ducts the assessment

be educating them-
selves about missed
opportunities. WW
4ſ. Taken as a whole,
my belief is that Make
Every Visit Count will
be useful in strength-
ening immunization
delivery systems. 7.
* The tool...helps

work. 31
for Pediatric Immunization Practices
T he Standards represent the consensus of the
National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC)
and of a broad group of medical and public
health experts about what constitute the most
desirable immunization practices. It is recognized
by the NVAC that not all of the current immuniza-
tion practices of public and private providers are
in compliance with the Standards. Nevertheless,
the Standards are expected to be useful as a
means of helping providers to identify needed
changes, obtain resources if necessary, and
implement the desirable immunization practices
in the future.
Standard 1. Immunization services are readily
available.
Standard 2. There are no barriers or unnecessary
prerequisites to the receipt of vaccines.
Standard 3. Immunization Services are available
free or for a minimal fee.
Standard 4. Providers utilize all clinical
encounters to Screen and, when indicated,
immunize children.
Standard 5. Providers educate parents and
guardians about immunization in general terms.
Standard 6. Providers question parents or
guardians about contraindications and, before
immunizing a child, inform them in specific terms
about the risks and benefits of the immunizations
their child is to receive.
Standard 7. Providers follow only true
contraindications.
Standard 8. Providers administer simultaneously
all vaccine doses for which a child is eligible at the
time of each visit.
Standard 9. Providers use accurate and
complete recording procedures.
Standard 101 Providers Co-Schedule
immunization appointments in conjunction with
appointments for other child health services.
Standard 11] Providers report adverse events
following immunization promptly, accurately, and
completely.
Standard 12. Providers operate a tracking
system to identify and notify patients due or
Overdue for immunization.
Standard 131 Providers adhere to appropriate
procedures for vaccine management (storage and
handling).
Standard 14) Providers conduct semi-annual
audits to assess immunization coverage levels and
to review immunization records in the patient
populations they serve.
Standard 15. Providers maintain up-to-date,
easily retrievable medical protocols at all locations
where vaccines are administered.
Standard 16. Providers operate with patient-
oriented and community-based approaches.
Standard 17. Vaccines are administered by
properly trained individuals.
Standard 18. Providers receive ongoing
education and training on current immunization
recommendations.

HOW to Use the
Count!
-tº-
Plan the ASSessment
1. Decide when the self-assessment will begin for example, at 10 a.m. on
the leastbusy day of the week.
2. Review the Individual Encounter Record and staff roles in the 3elf:
assessment with participating staff
Important: Once the assessment begins, screen every child aged 24 months
or younger who appears in the office until you have screened 30. Do not skip
some children and include others. In a multiple provider practice, each par-
ticipating providershould collect data on 30 eligible children
Before each child is seen:
1. Check the patient chart. If the child is 24 months old or younger, fill in
the name and birth date on the Individual Encounter Record. Note: Children
older than 24 months are not a part of this assessment.
2. Find the column that represents the child's age. If the child's age is not
listed, look at the closest younger age (Example: for a 9-month-old, focus on
the 6-month column.) Cross out the columns to the right.
3. Section I, History and Recommended Schedule---Compare the child's
immunization history with the recommended schedule. If the child has had all
doses of vaccine recommended in the series for that age group, check the "Up
to-Date" box for that vaccine in Section II.
If all series are up-to-date, go on to Section Ill. Keep the Record for the
Summary and Analysis (pages 6 and 7).
If the child is not fully up-to-date for all vaccines, you will need all of the
immunization dates to complete the self-assessment. Complete section I or
attach a copy of the child's immunization history to the Individual Encounter
Record. You may wish to ask if immunizations have been given elsewhere.
4. Section II, Analysis of Today's Visit---Complete the age-appropriate column
foreachvaccine.
"Could Be Immunized." If you know that the child is the appropriate age,
there has been a sufficient interval since the last immunization in the series,
and there are no contraindications, check "Could Be Immunized." See pages
2 and 3 for information on intervals. See pages 10 and 11 for information on
true contraindications. If you identify a contraindication, list it under section
Ill. If you are unsure about whether to check the "Could Be Immunized" box,
circle the box for consideration during the child's visit with the physician
5. Section ||. Type of Visit—Check the appropriate box.
6. Clip the Individual Encounter Record to the child's medical record
During the visit with the physician:
1. Section II, Analysis of Today's Visit---Look for "Could Be Immunized"
boxes. If there are no contraindications, immunize and check"Immunized
today." If now up-to-date for child's age, check the "Up-to-Date" box.
2. Section|||. Conclusion of Visit---if the child is up-to-date for all|mmuniza-
tions at the end of the visit, check"Yes." If the child is not up-to-date for all
Individual Encounter Record
immunizations, check "No" and complete the remaining sections. If the cri:
could not be immunized today, check all reasons why not and fill in the
blanks as indicated. List contraindications (see pages 10 and 11).
If the child is not up-to-date for all vaccines by the end of the visit, reminº
the parent to make another appointment for missing immunizations and
check "Yes" under "Follow-up." If you do not remind the parent to make
another appointment, check "No" and indicate why not
3. Remove the form (and any attached copies of immunization records) and
keep for analysis.
4. When you have completed forms for 30 children, use the forms to cond.:
the Summary and Analysis on pages 6 and 7.
Sample Record
The sample Individual Encounter Record on the opposite page is for John
Smith, born 6/10/95 and seen on 3/10/96. This patient has not been into
Dr. Brown's office since 11/15/95, when he had a follow-up visit for otits
media. His mother reports that he needs to be seen for a “stomach flu," with
symptoms limited to diarrhea and 100.5°F rectal temperature.
Before the child is seen:
The office nurse fills in John's name and date of birth, since he is the right
age for this assessment. John is 9 months old. The nurse crosses off all of
the columns to the right of the 6 months column.
The nurse reviews John's chart, noting that it appears that John is not
up-to-date for the HB, DIaR* and HiFi series. The nurse asks the mother
whether John has been immunized elsewhere. He has not. The nurse Com-
pletes all of the dates for the HB,DEAP and HHseries (needed for analysis
Since John received IPV at age 2 months and 4 months, he will not need
another dose (of either OPV or IFV) until he is 12 months old. The nurse
checks "Up-to-Date" for polio. The nurse determines that John is old enough
to receive HB3, DTaf’3 and Hi83 and there has been a sufficient interval
since the last dose in each of the series. The nurse circles the "Could Be
Immunized" box for HB, DTaP and HiBito indicate that John should be eval
uated for immunization.
The nurse checks that this is an acute care visit and clips the record to
John's chart for Dr. Brown to review and complete during the visit
During the visit with the physician:
Dr. Brown notes that John needs to receive HB3, DTaP3 and HB 3. John's
symptoms and diagnosis are not contraindications. John receives the three
immunizations and Dr. Brown checks the "Immunized Today" and "Up-to-
Date" boxes by those vaccines in section II. In section III, Di Brown checks
"Yes" in answer to the question about immunization status.
After the visit, the office clerk detaches the record and files it for use
in the Summary and Analysis.

Suggestions for Next Steps
ſº Completing the
toolkit got me
thinking about a
few things. I real-
ized our office was
not set up to give
vaccines on sick
visits. *
* The toolkit is a
valuable assess-
ment. Our office
has pretty good
rates, but improve-
ment is always
desirable."
* There are a lot
of great ideas in
here."
After reviewing the self-assessment data and your own practice patterns, you may wish
to use these suggestions. Some of the following reasons for underimmunization and
related suggestions concern office procedures. Reviewing them with your staff may provide
opportunities for useful exchange about how the entire practice team can work together to
improve immunization rates.
Reason for LOW
Immunization Rates
Suggested Practice Management
Steps to Improve Immunization Rates
Use of inappropriate
contraindications
Review contraindications list on pages 10 and 11 to ensure
that only medically indicated contraindications are being followed.
Children began series late
or fell behind
Use the minimum interval schedule on page3 to quickly
bring children up-to-date for all vaccines.
Children could not
be brought up-to-date
in one visit
Using the minimum interval schedule schedule on page 3 as
a guide, schedule follow-up immunization visit(s) as necessary.
Reluctance to administer
simultaneous immunizations
(May be a particularly applicable
factor for visits of children aged
12-15 months)
Review your current practice and decide on ways to
(1) provide parent education and assurance about the benefits
of immunization,
(2) remind staff about the need for all immunizations to be
administered, and/or
(3) establish an office policy to make an appointment for the next
immunization before the child leaves the office.
Parent unable to pay
lf insurance coverage is in question, talk to the plan Medical
Director or contact your local or State health department for
information on free vaccines.


## p. (#385) ################################################

Referral to
health department
Review practice protocols to make sure that
(1) parents are reminded of the importance of seeking on-time
immunizations,
(2) parents' copies of immunization charts are reviewed at
every visit to make sure that all immunizations were given and
recorded, and
(3) all immunizations, regardless of source, are recorded on the
patient record in your office.
Vaccine unavailable
If supplies are depleted too quickly or expire before use, review
use patterns and Ordering procedures to ensure adequate supply.
Missed appointments
Institute reminder procedures by telephone or postcard.
Parent refusal
Emphasize the importance of age-appropriate immunization: de-
scribe vaccine-preventable diseases, review immunization record
forms, use handouts such as the CDC Vaccine Information Statements
(see page 12 for ordering information). Check materials for parents
to ensure language and cultural appropriateness. Emphasize
safety of immunizing child/baby with mild acute illness. This is
a standard recommendation of AAPIAAFP.
Immunization available
only during well child visits
Revise office protocols so that immunization status is reviewed
and immunizations are provided as appropriate during every
encounter with a child.
Difficulty assessing
immunization status quickly
Add an immunization form to chart and record immunizations
there as well as in the chronological chart.
Low rates for a specific
vaccine prevent children
from being up-to-date
Improve immunization status review procedures. Emphasize
parent education about all vaccine-preventable childhood diseases
and vaccines.

Note 8 : Do not give varicella vaccine for at least 5
months afer administration of blood (except washed red
blood cells) or after plasma transfusions, IG, or VZIG. Do
not give KS or Vzló for 3 weeks after vaccination unless
the benefits exceed those of the vaccination. In such
instances, either revaccinate 5 months later or test for
immunity 6 months later and revaccinate if seronegative.
Note 9: The great majority of children with chronic ill-
nesses should be appropriately vaccinated. The decision
whether or not to vaccinate these children, and what vac-
cines to give, should be made on an individual basis
Note 10: Do not give OPV, varicella vaccine, or MMR
vaccine to a member of a household with a family history
of immunodeficiency until the immune status of the recip-
ent and other children in the family is documented.
Note 1 1 : A protocol exists for use of varicella vaccine in
patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). See
Varicella Prevention: Recommendations of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices.
Note 12: Whether and when to administer DTP or DTaP
to children with proven or suspected underlying reurologic
disorders should be decided individually. Generally, infants
and children with stable neurologia conditions, including
well-controlled seizures, may be vaccinated.
Note 13: The appropriate age for initiating vaccinations
in the prematurely born infant is the usual chronologic age
(same dosage and indications as for normal, full-term
infants).
Note 14: For hepatitis B vaccine, if the mother is
antigen-positive, use the vaccine schedule in which the
first dose is given at birth.
Note 15: Contraindicates vaccination only with vaccine
to which reaction occurred. If tetanus toxoid is contraind-
cºrd for a child who has not completed a primary series
of tetanus toxoid immunization and that a child has a
wound that is neither clean nor minor, give only passive
vaccination, using tetanus immune globulin (TIG).

Note 16 Not a contraindrcation, but consider carefully
the benefits and ſkººl of this vaccine under these circum
stances If the risks are believed to outweigh the benefits,
withhold the vaccination, if the benefits are believed to
outweigh the risks (for example, during an outbreak or for-
eign travel), give the vaccine
Note 17 Consider givrng acetaminophen before DTP or
DTaP and every 4 hours thereafter for 24 hours to children
who have a personal or a family history of convulsions
Note 18 The decision to give additional doses of
DTP/DTaP should be based on consideration of the benefit
of further vaccinatron versus the risk of recurrence of GBS
For example, completion of the primary series in children
is justified
Note 19 There is a theoretical risk that the adminigtre+
tion of multiple live virus vaccines (OPM MMR, and vari-
cella] within 30 days of one another not given on the
same day will result in a suboptimal immune response
There are no data to substantiate this with current vao
C n e s
Note 20 Consider the benefits of immunify to measles,
mumps, and rubella versus the risk of recurrence or exac-
erbation of thrombocytopenia after vaccination or risk from
natural irnfectirons of measles or rubella In most instances,
the benefits of vaccination will be much greater than the
potential risks and will justify giving MMR, particularly in
wew of the even greater risk of thrombocytopenia following
measles or rubella disease However, d a pior episode of
thrombocytopenia occurred near the time of vaccination, ſº
might be prudent to avoid a subsequent dose
Note 21 Measles vaccination may temporarily suppress
tuberculin reactivity MMR vaccine may be given after, or
on the same day as, TB testing If MMR has been given
recently, postpone the TB test until 4-6 weeks after admin-
istration of MMR if giving MMR simultaneously with
tuberculin skin test, use the Mantoux test, not multiple
puncture tests, because the latter, d results are positive,
require confirmation (and confirmation would then have to
be postponed 4-8 weeks)
Note 22 If the parent or other adult household contact
of a child recenwing OPV has never received polio vaccine,
this person should consider being vaccinated witH IPV
before or at the same time as the child Vaccination of the
child should not be delayed
Note 23 Vomiting and OPV Infants sometimes do not
swallow OPV If, in the judgement of the vaccinator, a sub-
stantial amount of the vaccine is spit out or vomited within
5-10 minutes after administration, another dose can be
given at the same visit If this repeat dose is not retained,
neither dose should be counted, and the vaccine should
be readministered at the next visit

ARI ICI. I.
The Impact of Interventions by a Community-Based
Organization on Inner-city Vaccination Coverage
Fulton County, Georgia, 1992-1993
Charles W. LeBaron, MD; Debi Starnes, PhD, Eugene F. Dini, MPA; Julie W. Chambliss, BA; Michael Chaney, MBA
objective: To evaluate the impact of interventions by
a community-based organization on immunization
rates.
Designs Controlled community intervention trial.
Setting and Participants: Children aged 3 to
59 months in Fulton County, Georgia, who were
patients of 1 of 4 public clinics (clinic based), or resi-
dents of 1 of 9 inner-city communities (residence
based).
Interventions: (1) Clinic-based intervention in-
cluded monthly review of clinic vaccination records to
identify undervaccinated children followed by contact
with family (reminder-recall strategy); (2) residence-
based intervention included door-to-door assessment and
education campaigns followed by mobile van vaccina-
tions, temporary on-site vaccination stations, free child
care and transportation to providers, incentives of food
and baby products, focus groups, and coalitions with lo-
cal organizations (community saturation with vaccina-
tion messages and opportunities).
Outcome Measures: Change in vaccination rates af-
ter 1 year based on clinic record reviews and population
surveys.
Results: For clinic-based intervention, series comple-
tion rates improved from 43% (87/204) to 58% (99/170) in
intervention clinics (P=.003), while rates in control clin-
ics did not change from the baseline of 52% (8.1/157 to
78/150), for a net difference between intervention and
control arms of +15 percentage points (P=.046). For resi-
dence-based intervention, age-appropriate vaccination
rates improved from 44% (154/347) to 61% (260/429)
in intervention communities (+17 percentage points;
P<001) compared with improvement of 44% (78/178)
to 58% (129/221) for control communities (+14 percent-
age points; P=.004), but the difference between arms was
not significant (+3 percentage points, P=.78).
Conclusions: Reminder-recall activities by the commu-
nity-based organization improved vaccination rates in in-
tervention clinics compared with control clinics. A sta-
tistically significant impact on vaccination rates could not
be detected for residence-based interventions by the com-
munity-based organization.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
Clinic Based
COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION
The organization in receipt of the award had been in exist-
ence since 1984 with a mission of providing health-related
outreach to disadvantaged populations in the county. It had
an office with 28 paid staff, 300 volunteers, and several mo-
bile vans. It was supported by private donations and gov-
ernment grants, had established ties with local groups, par-
ticularly those in Hispanic and public housing communities,
and had the support of local and state health departments.
STUDY SUBJECTS
Subjects were Fulton County children 3 to 59 months of
age who were (1) patients in l of 4 public clinics: 2 public
clinics serving predominantly African American popula-
tions and 2 serving predominantly Hispanic populations,
with 1 intervention and 1 control clinic for each ethnic cat-
egory and (2) residents of l of 9 lower socioeconomic com-
munities: 6 public housing communities with predomi-
nantly African American populations (3 intervention, 3
control) and 3 private housing communities with predomi-
nantly Hispanic populations (2 intervention, l control).
SELECTION OF SITES
Consistent with demonstration project methods, interven-
tion sites were chosen by the organization based on estab-
lished relationships of the organization to the underserved
communities and clinics, with the advice and consent of the
Fulton County Department of Health, Ga DPH, and CDC.
Control sites were selected prospectively by agreement of the
same partners based on racial/ethnic composition of the popu-
lations and comparability in access to care. None of the in-
tervention clinics was located in a control community and
none of control clinics were located in intervention commu-
nities; hence, the 2 groups of study subjects were distinct.
INTERVENTIONS
Interventions were chosen by the organization based on prior
experience and were applied for a duration of 1 year (Sep-
tember 1, 1992, to August 31, 1993).
In the 2 intervention clinics, workers reviewed vaccina-
tion records monthly, identified children in need of vac-
cinations, and made contact with the family, usually by tele-
phone or mail but, where necessary, by home visit.
Residence Based
The project was begun in the 5 intervention communities
with door-to-door campaigns to (l) identify the undervac-
cinated, (2) provide immunization education to families,
(3) provide them with culturally sensitive promotional lit-
erature, and (4) introduce them to the services the com-
munity-based organization would provide. This was fol-
lowed by establishment of weekly mobile van vaccinations
and/or temporary on-site vaccination stations, provision of
free child care and transportation to clinics for vaccina-
tions, and incentives of food and baby products. Focus
groups were formed to help identify ways in which the or-
ganization could better serve the community, and coali-
tions were developed with other community organiza-
tions, such as local churches and child care centers. The
spectrum of interventions was intentionally broad, impro-
visational, and opportunistic, rather than sharply defined
and invariant across populations and study period. The ob-
jective was to saturate the at-risk communities in as many
ways as possible with a variety of vaccination messages and
opportunities, a common method among community-
based organizations.”
OUTCOME MEASURES
Clinic Record Review
The Ga DPH has been measuring vaccination rates in
every public clinic in the state since 1986 with methods
that have been described in detail," and no changes in
these methods were made for purposes of this study. In
brief, the Ga DPH district immunization officer visited
each county clinic and reviewed the health records of all
children who had been seen in the clinic and were 21 to
23 months of age at the time of the officer's visit. Each
from 1992 to 1993, compared with 0% for the 2 control
clinics (Table 1). The rate of improvement for each in-
tervention clinic exceeded its matched control, but the
difference was only statistically significant for 1 pair. In
intervention clinics, the proportion of children who were
unvaccinated and had not been seen in intervention clin-
ics for a year was reduced from 40% to 21% (P<.001),
while in control clinics the proportion was also reduced
but not to a statistically significant extent, 37% to 27%
(P=.055). Rates of missed opportunities for simulta-
neous vaccination were not changed significantly in ei-
ther intervention or control clinics.
When the 19 county clinics providing complete data
were rank-ordered by coverage for 1992 and for 1993, the
2 intervention clinics both rose in rank (intervention clinic
A, 14th to 8th; intervention clinic B, 8th to 5th), while both
control clinics declined in rank (control clinic A, 6th to 12th;
control clinic B, 10th to 13th). The coverage improve-,
ment of 15 percentage points in the 2 intervention clinics
exceeded the improvement in the county's 17 noninter-
vention clinics (+8 percentage points), but the difference
was not statistically significant (P=.157).
RESIDENCE BASED
Population Surveyed and Ascertainment Rate
The total number of housing units in the 9 study commu-
nities was 2093, of which 1273 (61%) were occupied (range,
25%-85%); of these, 600 (47%) were occupied by families
known to have children younger than 6 years; 439 (73%)
of these units were successfully surveyed, identifying a study
population of 755 children (1.72 children 36 years old per
unit), of whom the vaccination status was successfully docu-
mented for 674 (89%). The total population of children
younger than 6 years living in the 9 communities was es-
timated at 1040 (600 units with children 36 years × 1.72
children/unit). Thus, overall vaccination ascertainment for

## p. (#393) ################################################

child's birthdate and vaccination dates were entered by the
health officer into a software application and, after exclud-
ing children who were documented to have moved or gone
elsewhere, vaccination rates were calculated. Included in
study analysis were Ga DPH data for 1992 (“before") and
1993 (“after") from the 4 study clinics, as well as from the
15 other county clinics.
Population Survey
A pilot survey conducted in May 1993 indicated that
many residents were reluctant to admit unknown persons
to their homes or to provide information to outsiders. As
a consequence, for the final survey, a community sur-
veyor strategy was adopted: the community-based organi-
zation recruited 29 residents from the study communities
to conduct the survey, under the supervision of a profes-
sional community survey research organization. These
community surveyors were paid to attend a training ses-
sion, and thereafter were paid $3.75 for each completed
household survey.
The pilot survey indicated that public and private land-
lords were unable to provide reliable lists of occupants, many
units listed as occupied were actually vacant, while some
units listed as vacant were actually occupied with some of
the occupants consisting of families with children younger
than <6 years. This suggested that sampling techniques
would be difficult to apply since the population denomi-
nator could not be reliably estimated beforehand. As a con-
sequence, the final survey consisted of a census of all hous-
ing units in all 9 study communities, and was conducted
between August 28 and October 31, 1993, immediately af-
ter the completion of the intervention phase of the project.
Unit maps of each community were used to ensure that all
units were surveyed, and for each unit, surveyors re-
corded whether the unit was occupied and the number of
children younger than 6 years in each occupied unit. For
units determined to be occupied but for which there was
no answer, surveyors returned on at least 3 subsequent days.
Where the immunization record was available, birthdate
and vaccination dates were recorded for each child younger
than 6 years. Where the vaccination card was not avail-
able, surveyors obtained the child's birthdate and the name
of the provider(s); vaccination dates were then obtained
from the provider(s). A brief questionnaire was adminis-
tered to families in intervention communities to assess the
extent to which they had been exposed to the activities of
the community-based organization.
Population estimates for the total number of children
younger than 6 years in each community were obtained by
multiplying the average number of children younger than
6 years in each successfully surveyed unit by the total num-
ber of units in the community known to have children as
occupants. After ascertainment rates were calculated, only
children whose vaccination status had been documented
were included in analysis. For the “before" subgroup, only
children who were 3 to 59 months of age on August 31,
1992, were included and only vaccines received on or be-
fore that date were counted; for the “after" subgroup only
children who were 3 to 59 months of age on August 31,
1993, were included and only vaccines received on or be-
fore that date were counted.
As a comparison to the population survey, we exam-
ined immunization rates for 1991 and 1992 in the 6 pub-
lic clinics serving the 9 study communities. Since non-
study communities were also served by these clinics, and
the clinicassessment method had a much narrower age range
(21-23 months) than the population survey, comparisons
were imprecise but did provide information on trends in
public clinic coverage for the catchment districts in which
the study population lived.
ANALYTIC METHODS
Data were entered into SAS' and analyzed. Age-appro-
priate vaccination status was determined using Ga DPH stan-
dards: by 3 months of age, 1 dose of diphtheria and teta-
nus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP) and 1 dose of oral
poliovirus vaccine (OPV); by 5 months of age, 2 doses of
DTP and 2 doses of OPV; by 7 months of age, 3 doses of
DTP and 2 doses of OPV; by 16 months of age, 3 doses
of DTP, 2 doses of OPV, and 1 dose of measles, mumps,
and rubella vaccine (MMR); and by 19 months of age, 4
doses of DTP, 3 doses of OPV, and l dose of MMR (“4-3-1
series complete"). Before-and-after changes were assessed
using a 2-tailed X’ test.
the survey was estimated at 65% (674 children 36 years
with vaccination status documented/1040 estimated total
population <6 years).
Baseline Coverage
In 1992, the overall age-appropriate vaccination rate for
the children who were 3 to 59 months of age (median,
27 months) was 44%, with identical 44% rates for the in-
tervention and control arms, as well as for children in
Hispanic and public housing communities, although sub-
stantial coverage rate variation was present among sub-
strata (Table 2). Age-specific coverage rates for chil-
dren younger than 24 months are imprecise because of
small numbers in the youngest age groups, but data sug-
gest that vaccination rates may have been very low around
the first birthday: 3 to 4 months, 69% (9/13); 5 to 6
months, 40% (8/20); 7 to 15 months, 14% (14/102); and
16 to 24 months, 32% (31/96).
For comparison to the population survey, the se-
ries completion rate in 1992 for children (median age,
22 months) in the 6 public clinics providing services to
the 9 surveyed communities was 48% (238/493), a rate
that is not significantly different (P=.192) from the 44%
(232/525) obtained by the population survey.
Changes in Vaccination Rates From 1992 to 1993
Overall age-appropriate vaccination rates rose from 44%
in 1992 to 60% in 1993 (+16 percentage points; P3.001)
according to the population survey, and improvements
were seen in all subgroups (Table 2). Since the median
age of the study population increased from 27 months
in 1992 to 36 months in 1993, a proportion of this im-
provement may be attributable to the progressive vacci-
nation of an aging cohort. However, age-specific cover-
age improved for all 5 age groups except the 7- to 15-
month age group (average percentage point change of

For comparison with the population survey, these-
ries completion rate in 1993 for children (median age,
22 months) in the 6 public clinics providing services to the
9 surveyed communities was 57% (235/.414), a rate that
is not significantly different from the 60% (389/650) rate
obtained by the population survey (P=.320). The im-
provement of 9 percentage points in these public clinics
over the previous year (P=.011) is also consistent with
the population survey (P=.144).
Intervention Impact
The increase in vaccination rates among children in in-
tervention communities was 3 percentage points greater
than among children in control communities but the dif-
ference was not statistically significant overall or for any
stratum (Table 2).
For comparison with the population survey, series
completion rates in the 4 clinics serving intervention com-
munities improved from 53% (139/262) in 1992 to 58%
(124/215) in 1993 (+5 percentage points; P=.313), while
rates in the 2 clinics serving control communities im-
proved from 43% (99/231) in 1992 to 56% (111/199) in
1993 (+13 percentage points; P=.008), for a nonsignifi-
cant 8-percentage point difference in improvement rates
favoring controls (P=.201).
Questionnaire Results
A total of 341 families with children younger than 6 years
were estimated to be residing in the 5 intervention com-
munities, and 264 (77%) were successfully surveyed. Of
these, 75% were familiar with the activities of the com-
munity-based organization, and the majority found the
organization's staff to be friendly and professional. How-
ever, 76% preferred to obtain their children's vaccina-
tions from their usual health care provider rather than
the organization's mobile van or temporary clinics. The
distribution of usual health providers was public clinic,
63%, private physician, 22%; and other provider, 15%.

We report the first controlled study, to our knowledge,
of the impact of interventions by a community-based or-
ganization on vaccination rates. Results suggest that the
organization's clinic-based reminder-recall activities may
have produced improvements in coverage compared with
controls, but no impact was detected where a broad spec-
trum of residence-based interventions was aimed by the
same organization at particular communities.
Baseline coverage estimates from both the popula-
tion (44%) and clinic surveys (47%) indicated low cov-
erage among study children. The consistency of results
suggests that costly and difficult residence-based sur-
veys may not identify populations in greater need than
would be found in a review of records for providers serv-
ing the same community. These findings agree with other
studies that found that undervaccinated children visit pro-
viders, often frequently,” and thus confirm that door-
to-door efforts are not needed to identify and access
undervaccinated children.
Generalized improvements in vaccination cover-
age, independent of study interventions, were found in
the population survey, and coverage improvements were
also seen in public clinics that were not involved in the
study, suggesting general improvements in vaccination
rates in the county. The causes of this large-scale im-
provement cannot be determined by this study. How-
ever, a program of measurement and feedback has pre-
viously been documented as instrumental in raising
coverage 7% to 9% a year in Georgia public clinics dur-
ing 1988 to 1994, a period that includes the time of this
study." Since 63% of families surveyed in the interven-
tion communities reported using public clinics as their
usual health care provider (consistent with indepen-
dent data indicating that 65% to 72% of the state birth
cohort was vaccinated in public clinics'), one would ex-
pect population-based coverage to rise, and the extent
of the rise in Fulton County is consistent with what would
be expected from public clinic trends.
Intervention clinics improved vaccination rates more
than control clinics. Since rates of missed opportunity
for simultaneous vaccination did not change in either in-
tervention and control clinics, internal clinic practices
do not appear to have improved. In contrast, dropout rates
in intervention clinics were reduced almost in half com-
pared with a nonsignificant reduction in control clinics,
suggesting that the community-based organization's re-
minder-recall activities may have been instrumental in
improving the vaccination status of children in interven-
tion clinics. The 15-percentage point improvement in cov-
erage in 1 year is also consistent with studies on the ef-
fect of provider-based reminders,” and the organization's
methods were similar to those used in such studies:
monthly inventory of provider records, followed by con-
tact with the families of unvaccinated children, usually
by telephone or mail. However, certain cautions are
needed in interpreting the results. Only 4 clinics were
involved in the study, the 2 intervention clinics were cho-
sen specifically for their intervention potential, the 2 pro-
spectively selected control clinics underperformed the rest
of clinics in the county, and, although intervention clin-
ics improved their standing in a rank-order of county clin-
ics, the difference in coverage improvement between in-
tervention and other county clinics was not statistically
significant. On the other hand, using series completion
at 21 to 23 months of age as the outcome measure for an
intervention lasting only 1 year may underestimate ul-
timate intervention effect.
For residence-based interventions, impact on vac-
cination rates was not detected in any strata of the popu-
lation survey or in the independent data from clinics serv-
ing the study communities despite the fact that most of
the community-based organization's efforts and re-
sources were directed at this aspect of the project. The
majority of children in targeted communities were in need
of vaccination, and during the study period vaccination
rates improved in both intervention and control com-
munities, so the situation does not appear to have been
refractory to change.
Consistent with the demonstration project design,
a number of operational factors favored impact: the com-
munity-based organization had extensive prior experi-
ence with outreach and long-standing ties with the tar-
get communities, it was allowed to choose the intervention
communities and have input in the selection of control
communities, the target populations were relatively small,
the project budget was more than $450,000, a 6-month
preparation period preceded the 12-month interven-
tion, and the size of the surveyed population was ad-
equate to detect an 8-percentage point difference in vac-
cination rates between intervention and control.
Funding community-based groups to provide in-
terventions to inner-city communities is often justified
on the plausible basis that an intermediary organization
with established connections to and knowledge of “hard-
to-reach" communities may improve the provision of in-
terventions. However, none of the individual interven-
tions used by the organization in the residence-based
phase of this study had been tested in previous immu-
nization studies, and their collective effectiveness was not
demonstrated in our study. In contrast, provider-based
reminder systems have been found effective in multiple
studies,” and there was evidence of impact in our study,
though not beyond levels previously reported. These re-
sults suggest that in hard-to-reach populations, favor-
able characteristics on the part of organizations provid-
ing interventions may be less important than whether the
interventions work.
Interventions using residence-based methods to iden-
tify and track unvaccinated children must overcome a
number of barriers. In this study, half of all households
did not have preschool children, and in other vaccina-
tion surveys as many as 17 households had to be con-
tacted to find an eligible child." Particularly in high-
risk areas, problems can be encountered gaining access
to the home, ascertaining the initial vaccination status
of the child from records available there," monitoring
subsequent vaccination status, and identifying children
born or migrating into the community after the initial

survey. Repeated door-to-door surveys can involve high
costs. In contrast, provider-based record reviews can iden-
tify, ascertain, and monitor groups of unvaccinated chil-
dren swiftly, with time-consuming and potentially haz-
ardous home visits saved for those who fail telephone and
mail reminders.
Three quarters of surveyed families in the interven-
tion communities were familiar with the activities of the
community-based organization and regarded the staff as
friendly and professional, but most families preferred to
have their children vaccinated by their usual health care
provider, which in most cases was a public clinic. Resis-
tance by inner-city families to vaccination outside com-
prehensive and usual health care has been found in other
studies,” and although this resistance may limit the ef-
fectiveness of interventions that focus on a single aspect
of health, ensuring that children receive nonfrag-
mented, regular care is consistent with public health goals.
Because this study was conducted among a limited
number of communities in one city, the results may not
apply elsewhere. Selection of intervention sites was not
random, but based on the community-based organiza-
tion's previous ties and perceptions of intervention fea-
sibility; similarly, the organization was permitted input
into the selection of control sites. This demonstration
project method explicitly favors the detection of im-
pact. In contrast to hypothesis-testing studies in which
biases favor the null, the absence of an impact under dem-
onstration project circumstances is less likely to be at-
tributable to study constraints, whereas an impact that
is detected requires confirmation with more rigorous study
conditions.
Other limitations should be noted. In the popula-
tion survey, the number of children in each community
had to be estimated based on survey findings, and the
vaccination ascertainment rate was 65%, with no data
available concerning the children not surveyed or ascer-
tained. Although higher ascertainment rates have been
reported for vaccination surveys of representative samples
of the general population, the rates for this study are con-
sistent with others in which high-risk populations were
targeted.” The study population was not character-
ized, risk factors for undervaccination were not identi-
fied, the age ranges of the clinic-based and residence-
based study populations were not identical, and the 4-
3-1 immunization standard has now been replaced by a
larger battery of antigens. Since the community-based or-
ganization did not provide a few highly defined inter-
ventions to target communities for the duration of the
study, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the ef-
ficacy of any of the many individual interventions they
used.
The use of community-based organizations is com-
mon in areas of public health where access to high-risk
urban populations is desired, but a search of the litera-
ture did not suggest that controlled trials of impact on
public health outcomes have been reported to date. The
one previous study in immunization reported that, among
295 inner-city children targeted by community-based or-
ganizations in New York City, age-appropriate vaccina-
tion rates improved over time, but there was no popu-
lation denominator, no ascertainment rate, and no
controls, and project costs were not provided.” Where
legislators and other public health decision makers choose
to invest heavily, as they have in the past, in providing
interventions through community-based organizations,
they should consider studies involving controls to evalu-
ate impact on measurable public health outcomes.

Methodological Difficulties in Assessing
Contributions by Community-Based Organizations
to Improving Child Health
HERE IS growing interest in establishing
partnerships between health care provid-
ers and community-based organizations as
a means to more effectively achieve pub-
lic health goals.” Community-based or-
ganizations play a key role in reaching health care con-
sumers and marketing public health. They interpret
scientific jargon into culturally appropriate messages and
package educational and referral services according to in-
dividual needs. Community-based organizations also iden-
tify and relay public health needs of the community to
health care providers. In this liaison role, community-
based organizations serve to bridge these 2 groups and
mobilize community resources for public health initia-
tives.**

The study by LeBaron et al" in this issue of the
ARCHIVES compares the impact of an intensive,
community-based immunization outreach and educa-
tion intervention with a clinic-based, reminder-recall
intervention. The community-based intervention
included a broad range of activities that aimed to
reduce barriers of knowledge, motivation, and access,
and to remind parents to have their young children
vaccinated. The clinic-based intervention consisted of
monthly assessments of vaccination coverage followed
by telephone, mail, or home visits to families of chil-
dren who were behind in their immunizations. The
study is the first comparative study of a clinic-based vs
a community-based intervention to increase vaccina-
tion coverage.
As the authors describe, the outreach and educa-
tional activities carried out by the community-based
organization were improvisational and opportunistic.
The messages were not systematically delivered or tar-
geted to specific audiences. Instead, the community-
based organization chose services and messages appro-
priate to the needs of the particular neighborhood.
These included door-to-door campaigns, family educa-
tion with culturally sensitive literature, weekly mobile
van vaccinations, temporary on-site vaccination sta-
tions, provision of free child care, transportation to pro-
viders, and vaccination incentives to families. This is an
impressive array of activities undertaken by the organi-
zation, touching on frequent barriers to completion of
immunizations, such as lack of knowledge, motivation,
limited access to transportation and immunization

Both interventions were associated with increases
in vaccination coverage rates during the study period: 15
percentage points in the intervention clinics and 16 per-
centage points in the communities involved in the com-
munity-based intervention. However, the increase rela-
tive to that obtained in the control clinics was significant
only for the clinic serving primarily the African Ameri-
can community, and not for the pair serving the pri-
marily Hispanic community. Furthermore, the increase
in immunization coverage observed in the community
receiving the community-based intervention was not
significantly greater than that experienced in the wider
control community.
The conclusion that the clinic-based reminder-
recall intervention was effective in increasing immuniza-
tion coverage is encouraging and supports the develop-
ment of more extensive clinic-based follow-up and tracking
of children who are behind in their immunizations. In ad-
dition to underscoring the importance of timely and fo-
cused reminders, this study emphasizes that clinic-based
interventions invoke the sense of parental responsibility
when interacting with providers. The differential effec-
tiveness of the reminder system in the clinics serving the
African American vs Hispanic communities might reflect
a difference in parental interaction with the provider, and
should certainly be investigated in future studies.
The stronger positive results seen for the clinic-
based intervention may reflect the more specific target-
ing of outreach efforts in that intervention. The clinic-
based intervention focused on recall and tracking of
children 21 to 23 months of age, a narrow age range when
most of the vaccination activity involves catch-up. In con-
trast, the community-based intervention targeted chil-
dren 3 to 59 months of age, spanning 2 distinct cohorts:
infants and school-bound children. With such a broad

age range in their target population, the community or-
ganization's outreach and educational strategy may have
been too diluted to be effective for any particular group.
In addition, the clinic-based intervention only
targeted children who were enrolled in primary care,
reminding parents who had already established a rela-
tionship with the provider. In contrast, the commu-
nity organization's reminders were provided to parents
both with and without established relationships with
providers. This heterogeneity with regard to primary
care linkage is one factor that makes community-
based interventions difficult. For some parents, the
message is simply to return to the provider, while
for others the message needs to be complemented
by referrals to a primary care provider. One of the
most important yet time-consuming elements of a
community-based organization's immunization out-
reach is referral to and follow-up with pediatricians to
ensure that children keep their scheduled appoint-
ments.”
It is precisely this linkage to primary care that ap-
pears to have been a problem for the community out-
reach in the study by LeBaron et al.” The community or-
ganization discovered that most parents did not want to
use the organization's vans or temporary vaccination sites,
which made the primary care linkage more difficult. Most
parents took their children to a public health clinic or to
a previously selected private provider, with whom the or-
ganization had no provision for tracking or follow-up.
This lack of follow-up may have been one factor dilut-
ing the impact of the community organization's out-
reach. At the same time, it is possible that the parents'
use of a variety of public clinics in the county may have
contributed to the increases in vaccination coverage ob-
served at all the public health clinics, both intervention
and control, a possibility the authors recognize. While
their study design is meant to separate interventions by
area, the possibility of contamination always exists for
community-wide interventions. Development of low-
cost methods to track immunizations and clinic visits by
the intervention group would help researchers better
evaluate community outreach strategies.
In addition, it is not known how much of the orga-
nization's efforts were spent in conducting door-to-
door outreach vs operating the mobile vans, or whether
activities were equally distributed across the entire tar-
get zone vs concentrated in certain neighborhoods, such
as the public housing units. Without specific data re-
garding the intensity or distribution of specific outreach
activities, the authors have little choice but to conclude
that the community-based intervention failed to in-
crease vaccination coverage significantly. The interven-
tion was associated with greater increases in immuniza-
tion coverage among those living in public housing, the
African American population, and children 2 to 5 years
of age. Were these differences due to different amounts
or types of interventions? There is an inherent danger
in concluding generically that the community-based in-
tervention was ineffective. One or 2 of the many inter-
ventions may have been highly effective, while others less
so or even counterproductive. These details are needed
for community-based organizations to achieve a more ef-
fective strategy mix and to prevent outright dismissal of
their contributions.
Appropriately, this study assesses changes in vac-
cination coverage with both clinic-based and population-
based instruments. This dual methodology allows them
to make conclusions about the effectiveness of each in-
tervention, but as they recognize, there are limitations
imposed by their data.
Although population-based surveys are able to
assess impact regardless of clinic visit status, they are
costly, and sample size, such as in the present study, is
often not large enough to include a sufficient sample
of the younger age groups in which one is most inter-
ested in assessing changes in immunization. In addi-
tion, population-based reviews are subject to limita-
tions, because parent-held records are not always
available, legible, or used systematically by parents or
providers. In this study, survey vaccination ascertain-
ment rates were 65%. The combined effect of these
limitations meant that the survey included fewer than
100 children younger than 24 months, before or after
the intervention. Much as the study would have ben-
efited from a comparison of changes in immunization
coverage in comparable age groups, the authors sim-
ply were not able to do so within the limitations of
their budget and study design.
On the other hand, accuracy of clinic-based
assessments also is affected by documentation issues.
In this study, the authors assume that parents in the
areas selected by the community organization would
use the public clinics closest to their residence. If par-
ents used other clinics, the audit results at particular
clinics might contain a mixture of children correctly
attributed to the designated study arm and some who
actually had experienced other interventions. How-
ever, identification of the child's residence was not a
part of the clinical audit method. Thus, this study, like
any other using standard clinical audit procedures,
makes assumptions that contamination effects do not
exist.
These limitations reflect the hard choices faced by
studies documenting the impact of community-wide in-
terventions. As this study demonstrates, compromises in-
evitably must be made concerning outcome measures and
the precise tracking of study subjects by interventions
received.
The different interventions and outcome measures
make this a complex study to digest. But the findings merit
consideration, not only for their implications for effec-
tive reminder-recall systems, but also for their method-
ological implications.
This study challenges us to integrate the usually
separate worlds of clinic-based and community-based
interventions and evaluations. Future research should
include process and outcome measures with more sen-
sitive indicators of the performance and impact of
community-based interventions. Rigorous program
evaluations should be a required element of funding
for outreach activities conducted by community-based
organizations. Public health departments, academic
medical centers, and schools of public health can
assist by providing technical expertise. In the interest

) Important Vaccine Facts for Seniors
1. Each year up to 60,000 adults, many aged 65 or older, die of infectious diseases
that can be prevented, such as flu and pneumococcal infection.
2. All people 65 years of age or older should get flu, pneumococcal, and
tetanus/diphtheria vaccines. People in certain high-risk groups should get the
hepatitis B vaccine.
3. Pneumonia and flu together are the 6TH LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH in
the U.S. Most of these deaths occur in people aged 65 or older.
4. Pneumococcal pneumonia is one of the most common types of
pneumonia. It often leads to hospitalization.
5. Pneumococcal vaccine can prevent up to 60% of serious
pneumococcal infections, but it will not protect you from other types
of pneumonia
6. You cannot get pneumonia from the vaccine.
7. Flu vaccine can prevent up to 70% of hospitalizations and 85% of
deaths from flu-related pneumonia.
8. Since flu viruses change each year, people should get the new
vaccine each year, usually in the fall.
9. You cannot get the flu from the vaccine. However, flu vaccine will
not protect you from other lung infections, such as colds and
bronchitis.
10. Because most cases of tetanus and diphtheria occur in adults, ALL adults should
receive booster shots every 10 years. People who travel outside the U.S. should be
evaluated for other vaccines that may be necessary.

Adult Immunization
Summary of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee Report
David S. Fedson, MD, for the National Vaccine Advisory Committee
In January 1994 the National vaccine Advisory Committee adopted a report that
reviewed the status of adult immunization in the United States. vaccine-
preventable infections of adults represent a continuing cause of morbidity and
mortality. Their majorimpactis amongolderpersons. Effective and safe vaccines
against these diseases are available, but they are poorly used. Several reasons
account for low immunization levels among adults, including inadequate aware-
ness by health care providers and the public of the importance and benefits of
vaccination. Health care providers often fail to take advantage of opportunities
to immunize adults during office, clinic, and hospital contacts and fail to organize
programs in medical settings that ensure adults are offered the vaccines they
need. Inadequate reimbursement for adult immunization by public and private
health insurers and a lack of federal programs to support vaccine delivery are
also major problems. The National Vaccine Advisory Committee's report in-
cludes five goals and 18 recommendations for improving adult immunization. To
reach the Public Health Service adult immunization goals for the year 2000, the
Committee recommends (1) improvements in public and providereducation; (2)
major changes in clinical practice; (3) increased financial support by public and
private health insurers; (4) improved surveillance of vaccine-preventable dis-
eases and vaccine production and delivery; and (5) support for research on
vaccine-preventable diseases, new and improved vaccines, immunization prac-
tices, and international programs for adult immunization.
IMMUNIZATION programs in the
United States have dramatically reduced
the occurrence of many childhood infec-
tious diseases (Table 1).” Diphtheria and
childhood tetanus have practically disap-
peared,andfatalcasesofpertussis(whoop-
ing cough) are rare.” No cases of indig-
enous poliomyelitis have been reported
since 1979." The occurrence of measles
has been substantially reduced." Cases of
childhoodrubella are rarely observed, and
there are few reports of congenital ru-
bellasyndrome.*Childhood mumpsis sel-
domencountered by physicians.” The re-
cent extraordinary decline in Haemophi-
lus influenzae typebmeningitis is largely
attributable to widespread use of Hae-
mophilus influenzae type b vaccines."
Nonetheless, thereemergence of measles
during the period 1989through 1991, the
persistence of congenital rubella syn-
drome," andlingering questions about the
safety of pertussis vaccine” are sobering
remindersthatcontrol of vaccine-prevent-
able childhood diseases requires constant
vigilance. Our nation has responded with
an unhesitating commitmentofresources

to expandourinmunization efforts, most
notably the president's Childhood Immu-
nization Initiative.”
The contrast between the impact of
vaccine-preventable diseases of adults
compared with those of children is strik-
ing. Each year, fewer than 500 persons in
the United States diedfwaccine-prevent-
able diseases of childhood. By compari-
son, 50000 to 70000 adults die of influ-
enza, pneumococcal infections, and hepa-
titis B(Table 2).” In addition, many child-
hood vaccine-preventable infections are
now found among young adults. Out-
breaks of measles,” rubella,” and
mumps”have caused major disruptions
on college campuses, in the workplace,
and in institutions such as hospitals and
prisons. Vaccine-preventable diseases re-
main an important cause of costly hospi-
talization, especially among the elderly.”
Currently, 98% or more of American
children are fully immunized by the time
of school entry." Although in some com-
munities the proportion fully immunized
by 2 years of age is much lower, several
programs have been established to ad-
dress this problem." In contrast, and in
spite of the much heavier burden of dis-
ease, vaccines that are recommended for
adults are not widely used (Table 2).”
Several reasons have been given to ex-
plain this. First, there is a limited per-
ception on the part of both health care
providers and the general publicthat adult
vaccine-preventable diseases are signifi-
cant health problems. Second, there are
doubts in the minds of some health care
providers and the public about the effi-
cacy and safety of several of the vaccines
used for adults. Third, adult immuniza-
tion is selective not universal; different
vaccines have different target groups
(Table 3). Fourth, the sizes of the adult
target populations for individual vaccines
vary and for some vaccines are much
larger than the target population for child-
hood vaccination. Fifth, unlike the child-
hood vaccination schedule that must be
completed if children are to enter school,
there are no statutory requirements for
adultimmunization. Sixth, unlike the child
health care practices in most communi-
ties, there are few programs in either the
public or private sectors for vaccinating
adults. Finally, reimbursement for adult
immunization has traditionally been ne-
glected by both government and private
insurers; children can usually obtain in-
expensive or free vaccines from public
health clinics, but until recently most
adults have had to pay the full costs for
most of their vaccines. The public avail-
ability of vaccines, school entry vaccina-
tion requirements, and responsible
parenting have given our nation a high
level of childhood immunization. In the
best of circumstances, it would be diffi-
cult to achieve the same for adults.
In spite of these problems, adult im-
munization has not been ignored. More
than 10 years ago two new vaccines for
adults were licensed: pneumococcal vac-
cine in 1977 and hepatitis B vaccine in
1983. The 1980s brought many new ini-
tiatives to promote adult immunization,
including those of the Advisory Commit-
tee on Immunization Practices,” the
American College of Physicians,” the In-
fectious Diseases Society of America,” and
the US Preventive Services Task Force.”
In 1988 the Health Care Financing Ad-
ministration (HCFA) launched its Medi-
care Influenza Vaccine Demonstration.”
During the next 4 years, close to $69 mil-
lion was spent in a multifaceted program
to increase influenza vaccination among
Medicareenrolleesandtoevaluate its cost-
effectiveness and health benefits.

Discussion of how to improve adultim-
munization must be included in the de-
care costs on the nation. Yet, there is
strong evidence that adult immunization
is highly cost-effective.” Thus,thechoice
we face is not simply deciding whetherto
pay for adult immunization, it is whether
to pay more for the costs of treating un-
prevented illness or less for preventing it
from occurring in the first place.
In January 1994 the National Vaccine
Advisory Committee (NVAC) adopted
a report that reviewed the status of adult
immunization in the United States.” This
article summarizes the NVAC report,
including the committee's goals and rec-
ommendations (Table 4).
1. INCREASE THE DEMAND
FOR ADULT. VACCINATION
BY IMPROVING PROVIDER
AND PUBLIC AWARENESS
In 1980 the surgeon general recom-
mended that by 1990.60% of all elderly
and high-risk persons should be immu-
nized with influenza and pneumococcal
1134 JAMA, October 12, 1994—vo. 272. No. 14
vaccines and 50% of target groups for
new vaccines (eg, hepatitis B vaccine)
should be vaccinated within 5 years of
vaccine licensure.” In 1990 these goals
had not been reached.
Surveys conducted during the 1980s
showed that physicians generally under-
stood the importance of vaccine-prevent-
able diseases and knew about the efficacy
and safety of vaccines recommended for
adults. However, they often failed to
translate their knowledge into clinical
practice.*Several studies demonstrated
that good administration and organiza-
tion were the keys to the success of vac-
cination programs.” Although specificqe-
tails varied, for each successful program
a decision had been made to establish an
organized approach for offering vaccines
to adults on a regular basis.
Better public understanding of the se-
riousness of vaccine-preventable diseases
and the benefits of vaccination is essen-
tial.” Many elderly patients fail to ap-
preciate that influenza presents a risk of
severe illness that may lead to hospital
admission ordeath.*Mostelderly patients
have no knowledge of the frequency or
severity of pneumococcal infections. Few
young adults who have multiple sexual
partners understand their risks for ac-
quiring hepatitis B. Many adults are un-
aware of the clinical effectiveness and
safety of the vaccines that can prevent
these diseases. Educational programs can
helpincrease public understanding of the
need for and benefits of adult immuniza-
tion. This was illustrated recently during
the HCFA Medicare Influenza Vaccine
Demonstration, when a letter sent to
Medicare enrollees by the HCFA admin-
istrator was helpful in persuading older
persons to get vaccinated.”
The NVAC recommends that educa-
tional programs be undertaken to improve
the adult immunization practices of phy-
sicians and other health care providers.
These programs should emphasize wide-
spread dissemination of the goals and rec-
ommendations for adult immunization, pe-
riodic assessment of provider knowledge
and attitudes about vaccines and immu-
nization practices, and better understand-
ing of the administrative and organiza-
tional features of successful vaccination
programs. Greater emphasis should be
given to adult immunization in profes-
sional education and certification, and
more attentionshould be devoted to prac-
tical approaches for vaccine delivery in
training programs, including appropriate
immunization of students and trainees
themselves. The committee recommends
that the public also be better informed of
theimportance of vaccine-preventabledis-
eases of adults and of the safety and ben-
efits of immunization. This will requirean
understanding of factors that constitute
barriers or promote easy access to vac-
cination services. The committee recom-
mends educational programs and media
campaigns for adult immunization, espe-
cially those that are linked to announce-
ments routinely directed to target popu-
lations by governmentagencies and com-
munity organizations.
2. ASSURE THAT THE HEALTH
CARE SYSTEM HAS AN ADEQUATE
CAPACITY TO DELIVER
VACCNES TO ADULTS
An efficacious vaccine will be effective
in preventing disease only if it is given to
those who will benefit. The importance of
vaccine delivery has been dramatically
demonstrated by the contributions of the
Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion(CDC) to childhood immunization. Ap-
proximately half of all children in the
United States are immunized through
state and local public health programs that
use vaccines purchased under federalcon-
tracts negotiated by the CDC. Studies
by CDC investigators on the epidemiol-
ogy of vaccine-preventable diseases, the
susceptibility of children to infection, and
the shortcomings of vaccine delivery pro-

grams provide the basis for the Childhood
Immunization Initiative." This research
has shown that the majority of children
and adults who develop vaccine-prevent-
able illnesses have been seen previously
by health care providers and could have
been vaccinated at the time but were not.”
Such “missed opportunities" for vaccina-
tion have several causes, including mis-
conceptions about contraindications to vac-
cination and the lack of an organized ap-
proach to offering vaccines. The failure to
prevent vaccine-preventable diseases is
far more often due to the failure to vac-
cinate rather than to the failure of the
vaccines themselves. The costs of these
“missed opportunities” are very high.
Most vaccines given to adults are ad-
ministered by generalist physicians, yet.
wide variations have been shown in their
immunization practices.” Many adults
who should be vaccinated receive their
principal care from specialists rather than
general physicians or from highly spe-
cialized teams of health care profession-
als or administrative units such as clinics.
In such settings, a single focus of respon-
sibility for offering vaccines is often dif-
ficult to identify. Thus, efforts to improve
adult immunization must focus on devel-
oping workable systems for regularly of.
fering vaccines to patients at risk, re-
gardless of where they receive their care.
Such systems should reflect practice
guidelines, and their evaluation should
become a common feature of quality as-
surance and accreditation programs.
The NVAC recommends that the CDC
and other federal agencies assume in-
creased responsibility for assuring that
adults are appropriately immunized. This
will require support for vaccine purchase
and program administration at the state
and local levels, as well as increased staff
and support at the CDC itself. The com-
mittee urges that all health care provid-
ers, whether generalists or specialists, con-
sider any contact with adult patients as
an opportunity to provide recommended
vaccines. The committeerecommends that
healthcare providers and the institutions
in which they practice adopt administra-
tive and organizational arrangements that

to adults, develop and implement stan-
dards and practice guidelines for adult
immunization, and include regular evalu-
ation of immunization practices as part of
their quality assurance programs.
3. ASSURE ADEQUATE FINANCING
MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT
THE EXPANDED DELIVERY
OF WACCINES TO ADULTS
Childhood immunization programs
have long received financial support from
federal, state, and local governments. Pub-
lic agencies have been much less involved
with adultimmunization; in 1991 less than
10% of all doses of influenza and pneu-
mococcal vaccines used in the United
States were given bystate and local health
departments (CDC, unpublished data,
1993). To address this problem, in 1981
the Congress instructed the HCFA to
pay physicians for pneumococcal vacci-
nation of elderly patients under Part B of
the Medicare program.” In 1984 reim-
bursement for hepatitis B vaccination was
added for Medicare patients with end-
stage renal disease. In 1993 Medicare was
authorized to pay for influenza vaccine
and its administration.”
The implementation of Medicare reim-
bursement for vaccination has not mea-
sured up to its promise. For example,
Medicare reimbursement for pneumococ-
cal vaccination during the 1980s barely
covered the cost of the vaccine alone.”
Each year during the period 1985through
1988, only 300000to 400000doses of pneu-
mococcal vaccine—25% of all doses dis-
tributed nationwide—could be accounted
for by the Medicare reimbursement pro-
gram. Whetheradequate reimbursement
isimportantforadultimmunizationshould
become apparent in Medicare's recently
established program to pay for annual
influenza vaccination.
There is little information on the ex-
tent to which private health insurance
companies provide coverage for adultim-
munization. Health maintenance organi-
zations may provide such services, but
theirimmunization rates are often nobet-
terthan those of patients covered by tra-
ditional health insurance.* Reliance on
regulatory approaches to improve private
health insurance coverage of adult im-
munization may not be sufficient; busi-
nesses that self-insure their employees
are not subject to regulation by state gov-
ernments. Proposals for health system
reform usually include coverage of child-
hood immunization. Similar coverage is
needed for adult immunization.
The NVAC recommends that publicly
funded health insurance programs ad-
equately reimburse providers for the
costs of vaccines and their administra-
tion to adults. Medicare and Medicaid
reimbursement policies must be moni-
tored to ensure that they are effectively
implemented by fiscal intermediaries and
providers alike. When problems are iden-
tified, technical assistance must be pro-
vided and financial or other incentives
considered so that adults enrolled in these
programs are appropriately immunized.
Similarly, the committee recommends
that private health insurance companies
adequately reimburse providers for adult
immunization, without requiring indi-
vidual co-payments ordeductibles. Busi-
ness and labor leaders and state-health
insurance regulators should encourage
inclusion of adult immunization as a cov-

the committeestrongly recommends that
all national health system reform pro-
posals include coverage for adult immu-
nizationservices and providemechanisms
to finance their delivery.
4. MONITOR AND IMPROVE THE
PERFORMANCE OF THE NATION'S
VACCINE DELIVERY SYSTEM
The nation's ability to control vaccine-
preventable diseases requires continu-
ing surveillance of the diseases them-
selves, an assured manufacturing capac-
ity to provide the vaccines needed, and
periodic assessment of whether the vac-
cines are reaching the persons for whom
they are intended.
The effective and efficient use of vac-
cines in adults depends on a clear un-
derstanding of which diseases are epi-
demiologically important and which per-
sons are at risk of infection. The CDC
works closely with state and local health
departments to monitor the occurrence
of vaccine-preventable diseases. For ex-
ample, it regularly provides timely ad-
vice on the identity of influenza viruses
causing outbreaks and information on
whether the current influenza vaccine
should be protective.” Surveillance by
the CDC has provided better under-
standing of the epidemiology of hepati-
tis B" and pneumococcal infections.”
These programs could be improved if
inexpensive methods were developed for
more rapid diagnosis of disease. Sur-
veillance is also essential for accurately
assessing the economic impact of vac-
cine-preventable diseases.
The success of our nation's immuniza-
tion programs depends on the capacity of
our vaccinemanufacturers to produce and
distribute a constant supply of vaccine
products. During the swine influenza pro-
gram in 1976, our system for vaccine sup-
ply was severely tested.” In the 1980s
liability costs contributed to the rise in
prices forchildhood vaccines and seriously
threatened the economic viability of vac-
cine manufacturers.” The National Wac-
cine Injury Compensation Program, es-
tablished in 1986, provides a mechanism
by which claims for childhood vaccine-as-
sociated injuries can now be settled.” Al-
though its implementation has been costly
and not without problems, the program
has succeeded in stabilizing the market
for the vaccine manufacturers.
. Onereason why the 1990goals for adult
immunization were not reached may be
the failure to monitor adult immunization
practices. In 1989 the National Center for
Health Statistics began to gather better
information on vaccination levels against
influenza, pneumococcal disease, tetanus,
and diphtheria. Its National Health In-
terview Survey has shown, for example,
1138 JAMA, October 12, 1994—vo. 272, No. 14
tna onlyzarzooieiuerly persons nave ever
received pneumococcal vaccine.” How-
ever, little is known about geographic
variations in the use of this vaccine or
about vaccination rates in persons at in-
creased risk of disease. For hepatitis B
vaccine, a great deal is known about vac-
cination status of health care workers,
but almost nothing is known about the
status of the other high-risk groups that
account for more than 95% of all cases of
the disease.”
The NVAC recommends that surveil-
lance of vaccine-preventable diseases by
the CDC and by state and local health
agencies be strengthened, including the
development of better methods of diag-
nosing disease. The committee recom-
mends that the capacity of the nation's
vaccine manufacturers to meet current
and future needs for vaccines be peri-
odically assessed to identify potential
technical, regulatory, financial, legal, or
political problems that could threaten
adequate supplies of vaccines for adult
immunization. This assessment should
also determine the appropriate level of
federal involvement in vaccine purchase,
production, and compensation for vaccine-
related adverseevents. Toreach the adult
immunization goals of Healthy People
2000, the committee recommends more
detailed evaluation of vaccination levels
in adults with specific high-risk condi-
tions and in specific population groups at
risk. It also recommends supportforpro-
grams to improve vaccine deliverywhere
immunization rates are found to be un-
satisfactory. (The adult immunization
goals of Healthy People 2000 provide for
increases in immunization levels as fol-
lows: (1) pneumococcal pneumonia and
alized chronically illor older people to at
least 80%; (2) pneumococcal pneumonia
and influenza immunization among non-
institutionalized, high-risk populations as
defined by the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices to at least 60%;
and (3) hepatitis B immunization among
high-risk populations, including infants
or surface antigen-pôsitive mothers, to
at least 90%;occupationally exposed work-
ers to at least 90%; intravenous-drug us-
ersindrug treatment programstoatleast
50%;and homosexual mentoatleast 50%.)
5. ASSURE ADEQUATE SUPPORT
FOR RESEARCH
Basic research on the viruses and bac-
teria that cause disease is essential if we
are to develop new and improved vac-
cines.” Equally important is research on
host responses to infection and vaccina-
tion, especially the responses of older
adults whose immune systems become
less responsive with advancing age. For

those of immunocompromised and aging
individuals. The committee urges the de-
velopment of better measures of the
health and economic consequencesofcur-
rent and future vaccine-preventable dis-

viability of our nation's adult immuniza-
tion programs requires continued evi-
dence of the efficacy, effectiveness, safety,
and cost-effectiveness of current and fu-
ture vaccines. The committee recom-
mends greater attention be given to stud-
ies of the epidemiology of immunization
practices. Researchonnew and improved
vaccines for use in the United States and
internationally must be assured stable
and continuing support. Finally, the com-
mittee encourages greater collaboration
betweenfederal agencies, nongovernmen-
tal organizations, professional associa-
tions, and vaccine companies in the United
States and their counterparts in interna-
tional organizations and in countries
throughout the world.

CONCLUSION
In making its recommendations, the
NVAC recognizes that none of its goals
for adult immunization will be reached
without giving attention to all. Thetaskis
complex and the effort and resources
needed to achieve success will be sub-
stantial. However, in undertaking this
work, the committee is reminded that our
nation's programs for childhood immuni-
zation have reduced the costs of health
care and improved the well-being of all
our children.We can and should expectno
less from our efforts to immunize adults.
The National Vaccine Program was established in
1986 by the Public Health Service Act to achieve op-

Vaccinations for Adults
Influenza
“flu shot"
You're NEVER too old to get shots!
Getting immunized is a lifelong, life-protecting job.
Make sure you and your health care professional
keep your shots up-to-date! Don't leave your clinic
without making sure that you've had all the shots
you need.
Many adults don't know they are supposed to get
immunized against diseases. They think shots are
for kids. There are millions of adults in this country
who need influenza, pneumococcal, tetanus, and
other shots. Are you one of them?
The "flushot" is recommended every fall for people age 65 or older; women who will be in their 2nd or
3rd trimester of pregnancy during flu season; residents of long-term care facilities; people younger than
65 who have medical problems such as heart or lung disease (including asthma), diabetes, kidney disease,
or an immune system weakened by disease, medication, or a physical condition; and for those who work
with or live with any of these individuals.
^^^^^^^^^^^%!"
Pneumococcal
"pneumococcal shot"
The "pneumococcal shot" is recommended one time at age 65 (or older if it was not given at 65). This
shot is also recommended for people younger than 65 who have certain chronic illnesses. Some individu-
als with particular health risks will need a one-time revaccination dose 5 years later. Consult your doctor.

A Message for Health Care Providers
A person who has had an anaphylactic
type allergic reaction to a vaccine or a
vaccine component should not receive that
vaccine without allergy testing. Frequently
noted components include:
• Bakers' yeast (the yeast used for
bread) in hepatitis B vaccine
• Gelatin in chickenpox and measles
(including MMR) vaccines
• Neomycin in inactivated polio (IPV),
chickenpox, and measles (including
MMR) vaccines
• Streptomycin & polymyxin B in
inactivated polio (IPV) vaccine
Allergies to thimerosol and latex are usually
contact dermatitis-type allergies and should
not deter vaccination. If the possibility of
true anaphylactic type allergy is present, you
may choose to consult with an allergist.
The management of moderate to severe
acute illness may be complicated by
vaccine administration. If a patient’s care
may be confused by vaccine side effects,
defer vaccination until symptoms lessen.
Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) has not
been clearly associated with currently used
influenza vaccine. However, patients with a
history of GBS are at increased risk for
recurrences so the health care provider must
weigh the patient’s risk of the vaccine
against the risk of influenza complications.
During pregnancy, a woman should not
receive live injected vaccines (e.g., measles,
mumps, rubella, and varicella). If a woman
states that she is not pregnant and will not
become pregnant within three months, no
pregnancy test is needed before vaccination.
The antibodies passively transferred during
the receipt of blood products may
interfere with live injected vaccines (e.g.,
measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella).
The time between the receipt of the
antibody-containing blood product and the
vaccine varies by blood product.
For more information regarding vaccines
or their contraindications, please call your
local or state health department. There often
is an immunization specialist on the staff.

Control & Prevention (CDC):

:
Then you Are old?
Are you one of them?
you 11–19 years need to be vaccinated
against these eerious diseases!
Many people between the ages of 11 and 19 think they are done getting immunized against diseases
like measles and tetanus. They think shots are just for little kids. But guess what? There are millions
of people between the ages of 11 and 19 who need tetanus-diphtheria shots, hepatitis B shots,
hepatitis A shots, chickenpox shots, measles-mumps-rubella shots, “flu” and/or pneumococcal shots.
Getting immunized is a lifelong, life-protecting job. Make sure you and your doctor or nurse keep it
up! Don't leave your clinic without making sure you've had all the shots you need.
Hepatitis B
(Hep-B)
You need three doses of hepatitis B vaccine if you have not
already received them.
Measles, Mumps, Rubella
(MMR)
Check with your doctor or nurse to make sure you've had your
second dose of MMR.
Tetanus, diphtheria
(Td) ("tetanus shot")
You need a booster dose of Td between the ages of 11–16 (if it
has been 5 years or more since your last dose). After that you will
need a “tetanus shot" every ten years. A tetanus shot is not just
something you get when you step on a nail!
Varicella (Var)
("chickenpox shot")
If you have not been previously vaccinated and have not had
chickenpox, you should get vaccinated against this disease.
Children 12 years of age and under need one dose. Teens 13
years of age and older need two doses.
Hepatitis A
(Hep A)
Many teens need protection from hepatitis A. Do you travel outside
the United States?” Do you live in a community with a high rate of
hepatitis A? Are you a male who has sex with another male? Do
you inject drugs? Do you have a clotting factor disorder or chronic
hepatitis? Talk to your doctor or nurse regarding your risk factors.
Influenza vaccine
("flu shot")
Do you have a chronic health problem such as asthma, diabetes,
heart disease, etc.? “Flu shots” are recommended every fall for
many people with chronic diseases. Ask your doctor or nurse if
you should have a yearly “flu shot.”
Preumococcal vaccine
("pneumococcal shot")
Do you have a chronic health problem? Talk to your doctor or nurse
about whether you should receive a “pneumococcal shot.”
* Do you travel outside the United States?
If so, you may need additional vaccines, including hepatitis A vaccine. Consult your clinic or local
health department about recommended and/or required vaccines for your destination.
A special message for parents of 11-12 year olds
A visit to the clinic when a child is 11–12 years old is recommended by the American Academy of Pe-
diatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Medical Association, and the U.S.
Public Health Service. This visit is a good time to make sure your child has had all the shots
he or she needs!

Use of the Vaccine Information Statements (VISs)
Aust. I use the VISs?
(ES! All U.S. health care providers must use
hem if they administer any of the following
accines or toxoids, alone or in combination:
Diphtheria Measles
Tetanus Mumps
Pertussis Rubella
Hepatitis B Varicella
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)
Polio (either live or inactivated)
Rotavirus (when the VIS is available)
The relevant VIS must be given prior to
dministration of every dose of the vaccine.
This is required under the National Childhood
Vaccine Injury Act.'
n addition to the VISs, providers should give
isual and oral explanations to people who
night not otherwise understand.
1ay I change the VIS or make up my own?
No, Federal law requires that the VISs
roduced by the Centers for Disease Control
nd Prevention (CDC) be used. You may add
he name, address, etc. of your practice, but
ubstantive changes are not acceptable.
'o whom do I give the VIS!
'ederal law says a VIS must go to:
. Any adult receiving one of the vaccines,
OT
. The parent or legal representative of any
child receiving one of the covered vaccines.
"Legal representative" is defined as a
person who is qualified to consent to
immunization of a minor under State law.
' 42 U.S.C. § 300aa-26
escGG DCGss
May I give VISs at other times, too?
Yes. In addition to the required use, it’s a good idea
to give parents copies of all VISs prior to the first
visit for immunization.
How should we record that we have given the VIS!
Health care providers must note in each patient's
permanent medical record at the time a VIS is
given: which specific VIS was given (e.g., polio),
the
date of publication of the VIS (on the back, bottom
right), and the date the VIS was provided.
Federal law also requires that all health care
providers record in the patient's permanent medical
record (or a permanent office log)
e the name, address, and title of the person who
administered the vaccine
&= the date of administration
EP the vaccine manufacturer and
e the lot number of the vaccine used.”
Know your State requirements
Health care providers should consult their legal
counsel to determine additional State requirements
pertaining to immunization. The Federal
requirement to provide the VISs is in addition to
any applicable State law and no State law can
negate that requirement.
How can I get copies of the VISs?
Single camera-ready copies of the VISs are
available from State health departments. The VISs
are also available on the Internet at www.cdc.gov/
nip/publications/vis/. More detailed instructions
regarding the use of the VISs can also be found on
the National Immunization Program (NIP) Website.

Vaccine Information Statements: Questions & Answers
What Vaccine Information Statements (VIS's) must be used?
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) requires all health care providers in
the United States who administer any vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis,
measles, mumps, rubella, polio, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and
varicella antigen to provide a copy of the relevant VIS to either the adult vacinee or, in the
case of a minor, to the parent or legal representative.
As of January, 1999, rotavirus is in the process of being added the vaccine injury table.
The currently-available interim rotavirus VIS may be used until a final version is published.
For vaccines not covered by the NCVIA, use of available VIS’s is strongly encouraged.
What is the difference between VIS's, Important Information Statements
(IIS's), and Vaccine Information Materials (VIM's)?
Technically, the law designates statements describing vaccines covered by the NCVIA as
Vaccine Information Statements. Important Information Statement is a term that was used
for these statements in the past, and is still sometimes used to describe statements for
vaccines not covered by NCVIA (e.g., hepatitis A, influenza). Vaccine Information
Materials is a generic term that has been used to describe any of these statements. For
convenience sake, we are using the term VIS for all current information statements,
regardless of whether or not they describe a vaccine covered by NCVIA.
Incidentally, from 1991 to 1994 we used multi-page “Vaccine Information Pamphlets”
(VIP's) for MMR, DTP, Tó, and Polio. These are no longer used.
What VIS's are currently available from CDC7
• MMR • Hib • Hepatitis B • Influenza
• DTP/DTAP • Chickenpox • Hepatitis A • Pheumococcal
• Polio • Rotavirus • Tol
How can I tell if the VIS's I am using are the most up-to-date versions?
Check the VIS section of NIP's website at http://www.cdc.gov/nip/publications/VIS/. The
VIS’s posted there are current ones for each vaccine.



## p. (#479) ################################################

Who must use these Vaccine Information Statements?
All public and private providers who administer the vaccines covered by the NCVIA are
required to use the CDC-developed materials. In 1994, an amendment to the act deleted the
language that allowed providers who buy their own vaccine the flexibility to develop their
own materials.
May immunization projects add state or local health department
identification to the VIS's?
Yes. But any other addition to these documents or variations from their language or format
must have the prior written approval of the Director of CDC’s National Immunization
Program.
How are VIS's distributed?
Camera-ready copies and explanatory information are sent to all Immunization Projects.
The Immunization Projects are responsible for printing and distributing VIS’s to their
public health clinics. They will also be asked to print and distribute single camera-ready
copies to all providers who administer vaccine in their state or metro area. Funds have been
included in the Immunization Project grants for printing and distribution of the VIS’s.
Some private provider organizations also print and sell copies of the VIS’s.
The VIS’s are also available on the internet (see “Where can I get the VIS’s,” below).
These are identical to the printed VIS’s, and may be downloaded and printed out by
Immunization Projects or providers and used as camera-ready copy.
What does “camera-ready” mean?
A camera-ready copy is a “master” that is used to make additional copies, and therefore
should be clear and easy to read. CDC’s camera-ready copies are printed on high-quality
paper designed to copy well. Projects may determine for themselves what they want to send
out as camera-ready. A good first-generation photocopy can be used as a camera-ready
copy.

Are VIS's considered to be “informed consent?”
Informed consent requirements are determined by state law. The VIS’s were written to
fulfill the information requirements of the amendment to the NCVIA, and are not
designated informed consent documents. However, because the materials cover both
benefits and risks associated with vaccinations, they provide enough information that
anyone reading them should be adequately informed.
Nevertheless, you should consult your state law to determine if there are any specific
“informed consent” requirements relating to immunization. The requirements could include
procedural requirements (e.g., whether informed consent is required prior to vaccination,
whether it may be oral or must be in writing, whether state law requires a signature prior to
vaccination) or substantive requirements (e.g., the types of information the state would
require to be included in any informed consent).
NOTE: In addition to any requirements of state law, all health care providers are still
required to provide VIS’s whenever vaccines are given.
What are the recordkeeping requirements regarding VIS's?
Health care providers are not required to obtain the signature of the patient, parent or legal
representative acknowledging receipt of the VIS’s. However, to document that the VIS was
given, health care providers must note in each patient’s permanent medical record at the
time a VIS is provided: (1) the date printed on the VIS and (2) the date the VIS is given to
the vaccine recipient, or the parent or legal representative.
In addition, the NCVIA still requires that health care providers note in the patient’s
permanent medical record:
(1) the date of administration of the vaccine
(2) the manufacturer and lot number of the vaccine
(3) the name and address of the health care provider administering the vaccine (This
should be the address where the record is kept. If immunizations are given in a
shopping mall, for example, the address would be the clinic where the permanent
record will reside.)
What does “legal representative” mean?
A “legal representative” is a parent or other individual who is qualified under state law to
consent to the immunization of a minor.

Must a VIS be given out every time a vaccine is administered?
Yes. A VIS must be given out with every vaccination, including each dose of a multi-dose
series. This is done for several reasons. The statement might have been updated between
visits, or the health status of the child could have changed (e.g., he or she may have an
evolving neurological disorder).
Must the patient, parent, or legal representative physically take away a copy
of each VIS, or is it acceptable to simply let them read a copy and ensure
that they understand it?
It is desirable for the person getting the shot or their representative to actually take the
VIS’s home, because they include information that may be needed later (e.g., the
recommended schedule for the vaccines, information concerning what to look for and do
after the vaccination, and what to do if there is a serious reaction). Even if some patients
may elect not to take the VIS’s home, the provider should offer them the opportunity to do
SO.
What about patients who are illiterate?
It is the spirit of the law that providers give their patients certain information about
vaccines. If patients are unable to read the VIS’s, it is up to the provider to ensure that they
have that information, either by reading or paraphrasing the VIS’s to them, and confirming
that they understand.
The Michigan Department of Community Health has produced a set of 6 VIS’s in
videotape format, in Spanish, for parents who have difficulty reading or who would prefer
to hear, rather than read, the information. (See “Where can I get the VIS’s,” below.)
Are the VIS's available in languages other than English?
There are currently no “official” CDC translations of the VIS’s. Several states have done
translations, and sharing of translations among states is encouraged. Projects or providers
may translate the VIS’s into other languages. These do not have to be approved by CDC.
(See “Where can I get the VIS’s,” below.)
Current translation capabilities of California and Minnesota are as follows (Note: this does
not mean that all VIS’s are currently available in all of these languages):
California: Armenian, Cambodian, Chinese, Farsi, Hmong, Japanese, Korean, Laotian,
Portugese, Romanian, Russian, Samoan, Spanish, Tagalog, & Vietnamese.
Minnesota: Amharick, Arabic, Cambodian, Chinese, Croatian, French, German, Hmong,
Japanese, Laotian, Oromo (Ethiopian), Russian, Somali, Spanish, & Vietnamese.

Mention of trade names, commercial products, or organizations does not constitute endorsement
by the National Immunization Program (NIP) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC).
Introduction
This guide was produced by the National Immunization Program, Vaccine Safety and
Development Activity, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to help
individuals research issues surrounding vaccine safety. A large portion of this guide is devoted to
identifying search tools and resources that are available electronically over the Internet. This
document also contains descriptions of selected vaccine-related publications, government
agencies involved in national immunization efforts and vaccine control, and organizations that
can provide pertinent information or assistance. This document is divided into seven parts:
I. National Library of Medicine Resources
II. Internet Resources
III. Vaccine-Related Publications
IV. State and Local Agencies
V. Federal Agencies and Programs
VI. International Organizations
VII. Other Resource Organizations
I. National Library of Medicine Resources
Comprehensive medical and health information is available through MEDLARS (Medical
Literature Analysis and Retrieval System), a computerized system of databases offered by the
National Library of Medicine (NLM). Of greatest use to the researcher investigating the
scientific and clinical aspects of vaccine safety is MEDLINE, a database of citations and
abstracts for articles published in medical journals. Journals relevant to immunization issues
include: Canadian Journal of Infectious Disease, Clinical Infectious Diseases, Journal of
Pediatrics, Journal of Infectious Disease, Pediatrics, Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, Public
Health Reports, and Vaccine.
MEDLINE and other MEDLARS resources can generally be accessed at medical or university
libraries, and they are also available at no cost through the following Internet sites:
Page 1 of 19


## p. (#486) ################################################

Internet Grateful Med
Web site: igm.nlm.nih.gov
Internet Grateful Med offers assisted searching of MEDLINE and other NLM databases,
including HealthSTAR (non-clinical planning and health care delivery citations) and HSRPROJ
(detailed descriptions of ongoing health research projects).
PubMed
Web site: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed
PubMed also accesses MEDLINE with the enhanced abilities to combine more than one search
and to automatically retrieve related items.
When conducting a database search in MEDLINE, it is helpful to be familiar with the subject
terms, officially called the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), consistently used throughout the
database. If you use a MeSH term, your search will be more precise, retrieving more relevant
records and eliminating "false hits" or records that are not really relevant. Below is a categorized
list of terms that you can use individually or in combination to retrieve vaccine-related
information:
Vaccination: Immunization, Vaccines, Acellular vaccines, Attenuated vaccines, Combined
vaccines, Conjugate vaccines, DNA vaccines, Inactivated vaccines, Synthetic vaccines,
Secondary immunization (use for boosters).
Specific adverse effects: For example, Arthritis, Encephalitis, Guillain Barre syndrome, Reyes
syndrome, SIDS.
Specific vaccine-preventable diseases of interest: Chickenpox, Diphtheria, Hib, Influenza,
Measles, Mumps, Whooping Cough, Pneumococcal infections, Poliomyelitis, Rubella, Tetanus.
For further information or assistance with your search, contact the National Library of Medicine's
Service Desk: (888) FIND-NLM. Additional information about the National Library of Medicine
is available at their Web site: www.nlm.nih.gov.
II. Internet Resources
The Internet is a valuable, ever growing resource of health-related information. The way to
search for Web sites that contain vaccine-related materials is through a Web search engine, such
as AltaVista, Excite, InfoSeek, HotHot, or Yahoo. Most of these engines let you type a plus sign
(+) before a term that must appear in the Web site, a minus (-) sign before a term that must not
appear in the Web site, and quotation marks ("...") around an exact phrase. For example, the
search
+vaccine +safety -flu
Page 2 of 19


## p. (#487) ################################################

will retrieve sites that discuss vaccine safety except as it relates to flu shots. Unfortunately,
unlike MEDLINE, all sites on the Internet do not use the same subject descriptors, so you will
have to experiment until you find the most successful terms and combination of terms. Before
you start searching the Internet, you should be aware that not all information posted on the Web
is valuable or accurate, and it is not always possible to determine the credibility of every Web
site. You can use the following Web sites as starting points that provide useful information
and/or links to many other sites of interest:

This booklet discusses six misconceptions about vaccination often cited by parents as reasons
they question the need to have their children immunized. Each misconception is refuted based on
scientific information and research findings. The misconceptions include (1) diseases already
began to disappear before vaccines were introduced because of better hygiene and sanitation; (2)
the majority of people who get a disease have been vaccinated; (3) so-called "hot lots" of
vaccines have been associated with more adverse events and deaths than others, and parents
should identify the numbers of these lots and not allow their children to receive vaccines from
them; (4) vaccines cause harmful side effects, illnesses, and even death; (5) vaccine-preventable
diseases have been virtually eliminated in the United States, so there is no need for vaccination;
and (6) giving a child multiple vaccinations for different diseases at the same time increases the
risk of harmful side effects and can overload the immune system.

VAERS is a reporting system created by the FDA and the CDC to receive and analyze reports
about adverse events that may be associated with vaccines under the National Childhood Vaccine
Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986. VAERS encourages the reporting of all clinically significant
adverse events following any vaccine, whether or not the vaccine is believed to be the cause of
the event. Both the CDC and the FDA routinely review data reported to VAERS. The FDA
monitors reports to determine whether any vaccine lot has a higher than expected reporting rate
of adverse events. The report of an adverse event to VAERS is not a documentation that a
vaccine has caused the event and does not enter a person into the vaccine injury compensation
process. Because it is difficult to distinguish a coincidental event from one truly caused by a
vaccine, the VAERS database contains events of both types. Anyone (health care providers or
consumers) can report an adverse event 24 hours a day.

COMMONLY ASKED OUESTIONS ABOUT
THE NATIONAL VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM
What is the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP)?
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (the Act) established the VICP.
This Program went into effect in October 1988 and is a Federal "no-fault" system
designed to compensate individuals, or families of individuals, who have been injured
by childhood vaccines, whether administered in the private or public sector.
What vaccines are covered?
Diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP, DTaP, DT, TT, or Tc), measles, mumps, rubella
(MMR or any components), and polio (OPV or IPV).
Effective August 6, 1997, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and varicella
vaccines have been added for coverage under the Program. Eight years' retroactive
coverage will be provided for vaccine-related adverse events associated with these
three new vaccines.
How are new vaccines added for coverage under the VICP7
On March 24, 1997, a final rule was published which, in part, provided for the
"automatic" addition of future vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) for routine administration to children. However,
Congress will still need to set an appropriate excise tax on any new vaccines
recommended by CDC before those vaccines are effectively covered under the
Program. Under the current statutory language, 8 years' retroactive coverage will be
provided for those claiming injury or death resulting from a vaccine newly added to the
VICP.
Who may file a claim?
A claim may be made for any injury or death thought to be a result of a covered
vaccine. These injuries may include, but are not limited to: anaphylaxis, paralytic
polio, and encephalopathy. The injured individual may file; or a parent, legal guardian,
or trustee may file on behalf of a child or an incapacitated person.


## p. (#506) ################################################

What is the time frame in which to file a claim?
For injuries resulting from a vaccine administered on or after October 1, 1988, the
following restrictions apply:
a.
In the case of an injury, the effects must have continued at least 6 months after
vaccine administration and the claim must be filed within 36 months after the
first symptoms appeared.
In the case of a death, the claim must be filed within 24 months of the death
and within 48 months after the onset of the vaccine-related injury from which
the death occurred.
The time for filing claims for injuries resulting from vaccines administered prior to
October 1, 1988, has expired. Any claims filed for that time period are subject to
dismissal by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (the Court).

Washington, D.C. 20005


## p. (#507) ################################################

How is the VICP funded?
Funding of vaccine claims depends on the date of vaccination:
3.
For vaccines administered prior to October 1, 1988, awards are compensated
from Federal tax dollars allocated by Congress at $110 million per year.
For vaccines administered on or after October 1, 1988, awards are paid from
the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund, funded from an excise tax on
every dose of covered vaccine that is purchased.
How does the VICP work?
The VICP is administered jointly by the Court, the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS), and the Department of Justice (DOJ). The process is as follows:
a.
An individual claiming injury from a vaccine files a petition for compensation
with the Court;
A physician at the Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation, HHS, reviews each
petition to determine whether it meets the criteria for compensation. This
recommendation is provided to the Court through a report filed by the DOJ,
although it is not binding.
The HHS position is represented by an attorney from the DOJ in hearings before
a "special master" who makes the initial decision for compensation under the
Program. A special master is an attorney appointed by the judges of the Court.
Decisions may be appealed to the Court and then to the Federal Circuit Court of
Appeals.
How is eligibility for compensation determined?
There are three means to qualify for compensation:
A petitioner must show that an injury found on the Vaccine Injury Table
occurred (see copy attached as Table 1); or
A petitioner must prove that the vaccine caused the condition; or
A petitioner must prove that the vaccine significantly aggravated a
pre-existing condition.
The Vaccine Injury Table lists specific injuries or conditions and the time frames in
which they must occur after vaccine administration. The Table is a legal mechanism
for defining complex medical conditions and allows a statutory "presumption of
causation." It is much easier to demonstrate a "Table Injury" than to prove that the


## p. (#508) ################################################

10.
11.
12.
vaccine caused the condition, and most claims allege that a Table Injury occurred.
Compensation is not awarded, however, if the Court determines that the injury or
death was due to a cause unrelated to the vaccine, even if it was a Table Injury.
In contrast to civil liability suits, hearings to determine eligibility under the VICP usually
last only 1 or 2 days. A case found eligible for compensation is scheduled for a
hearing to assess the amount of compensation. Most claims found to be
noncompensable receive awards for attorney's fees and costs.
How many claims have been received by the VICP and which vaccines are most
commonly involved?
As of June 30, 1998, a total of 5,274 petitions have been filed. The breakdown by
vaccine is as follows:
DTP: 73% Tetanus/To/DT 1%
MMR or components: 1.4% Other *: 2%
|PV or OPV: 10%
*Vaccines not covered under the Program or unspecified vaccines.
What is the amount of an award under the VICP7
Awards to the estate in a vaccine-related death are limited to $250,000 plus attorney's
fees and costs. Awards to individuals with an injury judged to be vaccine-related have
averaged $800,737 although this amount typically represents the cost of an annuity
that pays out significantly more over the life of the petitioner. There is no limitation as
such on the amount of an award in a vaccine-related injury; however, the law does
contain certain restrictions.
How does the VICP protect vaccine administrators and vaccine manufacturers?
a. For vaccine administrators and manufacturers: The Act requires that vaccine
injury claims involving covered vaccines given on or after October 1, 1988,
must first be filed with the VICP before civil litigation through the tort system
can be pursued. If a petitioner accepts an award under the VICP, the claim
cannot be brought subsequently to the tort system.
b. For vaccine manufacturers: In addition to the above, the legislation sets new,
more restrictive standards for actions alleging injury from these covered
vaccines in cases that are brought to the tort system.

16.
Under what circumstances may a vaccine administrator or manufacturer be sued?
a. If the petition has been judged non-compensable or dismissed under the VICP, or
b. If the award granted by the VICP is otherwise rejected by the petitioner, or
C. If the vaccine is not covered under the VICP.
Have there been changes to the Vaccine Injury Table?
On March 10, 1995, a modified Vaccine Injury Table (and the accompanying
Oualifications and Aids to Interpretation) became effective for all claims filed on or
after that date. Significant changes include the addition of chronic arthritis under
vaccines containing rubella (e.g., MMR, MR, R vaccines), and the removal of Residual
Seizure Disorder and Hypotonic-Hyporesponsive Episode (HHE) under the DTP vaccine.
The definition of Encephalopathy was clarified in the Oualifications and Aids to
Interpretation.
On March 24, 1997, further modifications to the Vaccine Injury Table took effect that
include addition of brachial neuritis and removal of encephalopathy for tetanus-
containing vaccines, addition of thrombocytopenia and vaccine-strain measles virus
infection, removal of residual seizure disorder for measles-containing vaccines, and
addition of vaccine-strain poliovirus infection for live polio virus vaccine. Modifications
also include the addition of three new vaccines: hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae
type b, and varicella. The Rule also provides for "automatic " addition of future
vaccines recommended by CDC for routine administration to children, although injuries
for such vaccines will be specified only after additional rulemaking. Coverage for the
three new vaccines went into effect August 6, 1997. All other Table changes became
effective for all claims filed on or after March 24. (See Table 1)
What documentation are vaccine administrators required to keep?
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act requires that the date of administration;
vaccine manufacturer; lot number; and name, address, and title of the health care
provider be recorded in the patient's permanent medical record.
What adverse events are health care providers required to report?
The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), operated by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and the CDC, should be notified of any adverse event by
completing a VAERS reporting form. The following events are required to be reported:
a. Any event set forth in the Vaccine Injury Table that occurs within the time
period specified or within 7 days, if that is longer.
b. Any contraindicating event listed in the manufacturer's package insert.

In addition, VAERS accepts all reports by any interested party of real or suspected
adverse events occurring after the administration of any vaccine.

many have been awarded compensation? How much money has been spent on
compensation awards?

minutes to a few hours after exposure. Death, if it occurs, usually results from airway obstruction caused by laryngeal edema or bronchospasm and may be associated º
cardiovascular collapse. Other significant clinical signs and symptoms may include the following: Cyanosis, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, edemada
pharynx and/or trachea and/or larynx with stridor and dyspnea. Autopsy findings may include acute emphysema which results from lower respiratory tract obstruction. -
hypopharynx, epiglottis, larynx, or trachea and minimal findings of eosinophilia in the liver, spleen and lungs. When death occurs within minutes of exposure and withou
respiratory distress, there may not be significant pathologic findings.
(2) Encephalopathy. For purposes of the Vaccine Injury Table, a vaccine recipient shall be considered to have suffered an encephalopathy only if such recipient manifests,
applicable period, an injury meeting the description below of an acute encephalopathy, and then a chronic encephalopathy persists in such person for more than 6 months
date of vaccination.
(i) An acute Encephalopathy is one that is sufficiently severe so as to require hospitalization (whether or not hospitalization occurred).
(A) For children less than 18 months of age who present without an associated seizure event, an acute encephalopathy is indicated by a “significantly decreased leveld
consciousness” (see “D” below) lasting for at least 24 hours. Those children less than 18 months of age who present following a seizure shall be viewed as havingr
acute encephalopathy if their significantly decreased level of consciousness persists beyond 24 hours and cannot be attributed to a postictal state (seizure) or
medication.
(B) For adults and children 18 months of age or older, an acute encephalopathy is one that persists for at least 24 hours and characterized by at least two of the follow:
(1) A significant change in mental status that is not medication related; specifically a confusional state, or a delirium, or a psychosis,
(2) A significantly decreased level of consciousness, which is independent of a seizure and cannot be attributed to the effects of medication; and
(3) A seizure associated with loss of consciousness.
(C) Increased intracranial pressure may be a clinical feature of acute encephalopathy in any age group
(D) A "significantly decreased level of consciousness" is indicated by the presence of at least one of the following clinical signs for at least 24 hours or greater (see
paragraphs (2)(1)(A) and (2)(1)(B) of this section for applicable timeframes):
(1) Decreased or absent response to environment (responds, if at all, only to loud voice or painful stimuli),
(2) Decreased or absent eye contact (does not fix gaze upon family members or other individuals); or
(3) Inconsistent or absent responses to external stimuli (does not recognize familiar people or things).
(E) The following clinical features alone, or in combination, do not demonstrate an acute encephalopathy or a significant change in either mental status or level of
as described above: Sleepiness, irritability (fussiness), high-pitched and unusual screaming, persistent inconsolable crying, and bulging fontanelle. Seizures in
not sufficient to constitute a diagnosis of encephalopathy. In the absence of other evidence of an acute encephalopathy, seizures shall not be viewed as the first º
manifestation of the onset of an acute encephalopathy.
(ii) Chronic ºncephalopathy occurs when a change in mental or neurologic status, first manifested during the applicable time period, persists for a period of at least 6 mºnº
date of vaccination. Individuals who return to a normal neurologic state after the acute encephalopathy shall not be presumed to have suffered residual neurologic
that event, any subsequent chronic encephalopathy shall not be presumed to be a sequela of the acute encephalopathy. If a preponderance of the evidence indicates tº
chronic encephalopathy is secondary to genetic, prenatal or perinatal factors, that chronic encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Tº |
(iii) An encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table if in a proceeding on a petition, it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence tº
encephalopathy was caused by an infection, a toxin, a metabolic disturbance, a structural lesion, a genetic disorder or trauma (without regard to whether the cause city
infection, toxin, trauma, metabolic disturbance, structural lesion or genetic disorder is known). If at the time a decision is made on a petition filed under section?!!"
Act for a vaccine-related injury or death, it is not possible to determine the cause by a preponderance of the evidence of an encephalopathy, the encephalopathy shall”
considered to be a condition set forth in the Table.
(iv) in determining whether or not an encephalopathy is a condition set forth in the Table, the Court shall consider the entire medical record.

-
jual Seizure Disorder. A petitioner may be considered to have suffered a residual seizure disorder for purposes of the Vaccine Injury Table, if the first seizure or convulsion
ned 5-15 days (not less than 5 days and not more than 15 days) after administration of the vaccine and 2 or more additional distinct seizure or convulsion episodes occurred
in 1 year after the administration of the vaccine which were unaccompanied by fever (defined as a rectal temperature equal to or greater than 101.0 degrees Fahrenheit or an oral
erature equal to or greater than 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit). A distinct seizure or convulsion episode is ordinarily defined as including all seizure or convulsive activity occurring
in a 24-hour period, unless competent and qualified expert neurological testimony is presented to the contrary in a particular case.
-
xurposes of the Vaccine Injury Table, a petitioner shall not be considered to have suffered a residual seizure disorder, if the petitioner suffered a seizure or convulsion
×ompanied by fever (as defined above) before the fifth day after the administration of the vaccine involved.

ure and convulsion. For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this section, the terms, "seizure" and "convulsion" include myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal), and
ile and complex partial seizures. Absence (petit mal) seizures shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the Table. Jerking movements or staring episodes alone are
Thecessarily an indication of seizure activity.
lela. The term "sequela" means a condition or event which was actually caused by a condition listed in the Vaccine Injury Table.
-nic Arthritis. For purposes of the Vaccine Injury Table, chronic arthritis may be found in a person with no history in the 3 years prior to vaccination of arthropathy (joint
ase) on the basis of:
Medical documentation, recorded within 30 days after the onset, of objective signs of acute arthritis (joint swelling) that occurred between 7 and 42 days after a rubella
>ination;
T Medical documentation (recorded within 3 years after the onset of acute arthritis) of the persistence of objective signs of intermittent or continuous arthritis for more than 6
ths following vaccination:
Medical documentation of an antibody response to the rubella virus.
purposes of the Vaccine Injury Table, the following shall not be considered as chronic arthritis: Musculoskeletal disorders such as diffuse connective tissue diseases (including
not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease,
ymyositis/dermatomyositis, fibromyalgia, necrotizing vasculitis and vasculopathies and Sjogren's Syndrome), degenerative joint disease, infectious agents other than rubella
wether by direct invasion or as an immune reaction), metabolic and endocrine diseases, trauma, neoplasms, neuropathic disorders, bone and cartilage disorders and arthritis
ºciated with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, Reiter's syndrome, or blood disorders.
r:
thralgia (joint pain) or stiffness without joint swelling shall not be viewed as chronic arthritis for purposes of the Vaccine Injury Table.
Ichial neuritis is defined as dysfunction limited to the upper extremity nerve plexus (i.e., its trunks, divisions, or cords) without involvement of other peripheral (e.g., nerve roots or
ingle peripheral nerve) or central (e.g., spinal cord) nervous system structures. A deep, steady, often severe aching pain in the shoulder and upper arm usually heralds onset of the
ndition. The pain is followed in days or weeks by weakness and atrophy in upper extremity muscle groups. Sensory loss may accompany the motor deficits, but is generally a less
able clinical feature. The neuritis, or plexopathy, may be present on the same side as or the opposite side of the injection; it is sometimes bilateral, affecting both upper
remities. Weakness is required before the diagnosis can be made. Motor, sensory, and reflex findings on physical examination and the results of nerve conduction and
ctromyographic studies must be consistent in confirming that dysfunction is attributable to the brachial plexus. The condition should thereby be distinguishable from conditions
t may give rise to dysfunction of nerve roots (i.e., radiculopathies) and peripheral nerves (i.e., including multiple mononeuropathies), as well as other peripheral and central
ſºvous system structures (e.g., cranial neuropathies and myelopathies).
º
tombocytopenic purpura is defined by a serum platelet count less than 50,000/mm'. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases of thrombocytopenia associated with other
uses such as hypersplenism, autoimmune disorders (including alloantibodies from previous transfusions) myelodysplasias, lymphoproliferative disorders, congenital
ombocytopenia or hemolytic uremic syndrome. This does not include cases of immune (formerly called idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) that are mediated, for
ample, by viral or fungal infections, toxins or drugs. Thrombocytopenic purpura does not include cases of thrombocytopenia associated with disseminated intravascular
agulation, as observed with bacterial and viral infections. Viral infections include, for example, those infections secondary to Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A and
rhinovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), adenovirus, and dengue virus. An antecedent viral infection may be demonstrated by clinical signs and symptoms and need not
confirmed by culture or serologic testing. Bone marrow examination, if performed, must reveal a normal or an increased number of megakaryocytes in an otherwise normal
intow.
|ccine-strain measles viral infection is defined as a disease caused by the vaccine-strain that should be determined by vaccine-specific monoclonal antibody or polymerase chain
action tests.
ſ
accine-strai to viſal infection is defined as a disease caused by poliovirus that is isolated from the affected tissue and should be determined to be the vaccine-strain by
igonucleotide or polymerase chain reaction. Isolation of poliovirus from the stool is not sufficient to establish a tissue specific infection or disease caused by vaccine-strain
iliovirus.
arly-onset Hib disease is defined as invasive bacterial illness associated with the presence of Hib organism on culture of normally sterile body fluids or tissue, or clinical findings
insistent with the diagnosis of epiglottitis. Hib pneumonia qualifies as invasive Hib disease when radiographic findings consistent with the diagnosis of pneumonitis are
'companied by a blood culture positive for the Hib organism. Otitis media, in the absence of the above findings, does not qualify as invasive bacterial disease. A child is
*sidered to have suffered this injury only if the vaccine was the first Hib immunization received by the child.

DIRECTIONS FOR COMPLETING FORM
(Additional pages may be attached if more space is needed.)
GENERAL
Use a separate form for each patient. Complete the form to the best of your abilities. Items 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 13 are considered
essential and should be completed whenever possible. Parents/Guardians may need to consult the facility where the vaccine was
administered for some of the information (such as manufacturer, lot number or laboratory data.)
Refer to the Vaccine Injury Table (VIT) for events mandated for reporting by law. Reporting for other serious events felt to be related
but not on the VIT is encouraged.
Health care providers other than the vaccine administrator (VA) treating a patient for a suspected adverse event should notify the
VA and provide the information about the adverse event to allow the VA to complete the form to meet the VA's legal responsibility.
These data will be used to increase understanding of adverse events following vaccination and will become part of CDC Privacy
Act System 09-20-0136, “Epidemiologic Studies and Surveillance of Disease Problems". Information identifying the person who
received the vaccine or that person's legal representative will not be made available to the public, but maybe available to the vaccinee
or legal representative.
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS

INTRODUCTION
As a practitioner giving vaccinations, you will encounter patients who have
reservations about getting vaccinations or getting them for their children,
including some who might decline to be vaccinated at all. There can be many
reasons for patients' fear of or opposition to vaccination. Some patients have
religious or philosophic objections. Some see mandatory vaccination as
interference by the government into what they believe should be a personal choice.
Others are concerned about the safety and/or efficacy of vaccines, or may believe
that vaccine-preventable diseases do not pose a serious health risk.
A practitioner has a responsibility to listen to and try to understand a patient's
concerns, fears, and beliefs about vaccination and to take these into consideration
when offering vaccines. This will not only help to strengthen the bond of trust
between patient and provider but will also help you decide what, if any,
arguments might be most effective in persuading these patients to accept
vaccination.
The purpose of this pamphlet is to address five common misconceptions about
vaccination. These are often cited by concerned parents as reasons to question the
wisdom of vaccinating their children, and if we can respond with accurate
rebuttals perhaps we can not only ease their minds on these specific issues but
discourage them from accepting other anti-vaccine "facts" at face value. Our goal
is not to browbeat parents into vaccinating, but to make sure they have accurate
information with which to make an informed decision.

1. Diseases had already begun to disoppedr before vaccines were introduced,
because of better hygiene and sonifation.
Statements like this are very common in anti-vaccine literature, the intent
apparently being to suggest that vaccines are not needed. Improved socioeconomic
conditions have undoubtedly had an indirect impact on disease. Better nutrition,
not to mention the development of antibiotics and other treatments, have
increased survival rates among the sick; less crowded living conditions have
reduced disease transmission; and lower birth rates have decreased the number of
susceptible household contacts. But looking at the actual incidence of disease over
the years can leave little doubt of the significant direct impact vaccines have had,
even in modern times. Here, for example, is a graph showing the reported
incidence of measles from 1920 to the present.

There were periodic peaks and valleys throughout the years, but the real,
permanent drop coincided with the licensure and wide use of measles vaccine
beginning in 1963. Graphs for other vaccine-preventable diseases show a roughly
similar pattern, with all except hepatitis B showing a significant drop in cases
-
"The incidence rate of hepatitis B has not dropped as dramatically yet because
the infants we began vaccinating in 1991 will not be at high risk of the disease
until they are at least teenagers. Therefore we expect about a 15-year lag
between the start of universal infant vaccination and a significant drop in disease
incidence.

corresponding with the advent of vaccine use. Are we expected to believe that
better sanitation caused incidence of each disease to drop, coincidentally, just at
the time a vaccine for that disease was introduced?
Hib vaccine is another good example, because Hib disease was prevalent up until
just a few years ago, when conjugate vaccines that can be used in infants were
finally developed. (The polysaccharide vaccine previously available could not be
used for infants, in whom most of the disease was occurring.) Since sanitation is
not better now than it was in 1990, it is hard to attribute the virtual
disappearance of Hib disease in children in recent years (from an estimated 20,000
cases a year to 1,419 cases in 1993, and dropping) to anything other than the
VaCCII) e.
Varicella can also be used to illustrate the point, since modern sanitation has
obviously not prevented nearly 4 million cases from occurring each year in the
United States. If diseases were disappearing, we should expect varicella to be
disappearing along with the rest of them. But nearly all children in the United
States get the disease today, just as they did 20 years ago or 80 years ago. Based
on experience with the varicella vaccine in studies prior to licensure, we can
expect the incidence of varicella to drop significantly now that a vaccine has been
licensed for the United States.
Finally, we can look at the experiences of several developed countries that let their
immunization levels drop. Three countries — Great Britain, Sweden, and Japan
— cut back on the use of pertussis vaccine because of fear about the vaccine. The
effect was dramatic and immediate. In Great Britain, a drop in pertussis
vaccination in 1974 was followed by an epidemic of more than 100,000 cases of
pertussis and 36 deaths by 1978. In Japan, around the same time, a drop in
vaccination rates from 70% to 20%-40% led to a jump in pertussis from 393 cases
and no deaths in 1974 to 13,000 cases and 41 deaths in 1979. In Sweden, the
annual incidence rate of pertussis per 100,000 children 0-6 years of age increased
from 700 cases in 1981 to 3,200 in 1985. It seems clear from these experiences
that not only would diseases not be disappearing without vaccines, but if we were
to stop vaccinating, they would come back.
Of more immediate interest is the major epidemic of diphtheria now taking place
in the former Soviet Union, where low primary immunization rates in children
and lack of booster immunizations in adults have resulted in an increase from 839
cases in 1989 to nearly 50,000 cases and 1,700 deaths in 1994, with the number of
cases increasing by 2- to 10-fold each year. There have already been at least 20
imported cases in Europe and two cases in U.S. citizens working in the former
Soviet Union.

2. The majority of people getting disease have been fully immunized.
This is another argument frequently found in anti-vaccine literature — the
implication being that this proves vaccines are not effective. In fact it is true that
in an outbreak the cases who were vaccinated often outnumber those who were
not – even with vaccines such as measles, which we know to be about 98%
effective when used as recommended.
This apparent paradox is explained by two factors. First, no vaccine is 100%
effective. To make vaccines safer than the disease, the bacteria or virus is killed
or weakened (attenuated). For reasons related to the individual, not all persons
vaccinated will develop immunity. Most routine childhood vaccines have efficacy
in the 85-95% range. Second, in a country like the United States the people who
have been vaccinated vastly outnumber those who have not. How these two
factors work together to result in outbreaks where the majority of cases have been
vaccinated can be more easily understood by looking at a hypothetical example:
In a high school of 1,000 students, none has ever had measles. All
but 5 of the students have had two doses of measles vaccine, and so
are fully immunized. The entire student body is exposed to measles
and every susceptible student becomes infected. The 5 unvaccinated
students will be infected, of course. But of the 995 who have been
vaccinated, we would expect several vaccine failures. The efficacy
rate for two doses of measles vaccine can be as high as >99%, and in
this class there are 7 vaccine failures, who become infected too.
Therefore 7/12, or about 58%, of the cases are fully vaccinated.
As you can see, this doesn't prove the vaccine didn't work — only that most of the
children in the class had been vaccinated, so the vaccine failures outnumbered the
unvaccinated susceptibles. Looking at it another way, 100% of the children who
were not vaccinated got measles, compared with less than 1% of those who were.
Measles vaccine protected most of the class; if nobody in the class had been
vaccinated, there would have been 1,000 cases of measles.

3. There dre "hot lots" of voccine ſhot hove been dssocioted with more doverse
events Cºnd dedihs thon of hers. Porents should find the numbers of these lots
cºnd not dllow their children to receive voccines from them.
This misconception got considerable publicity recently when vaccine safety was the
subject of a television news program. First of all, the concept of a "hot lot" of
vaccine as it is used in this context is wrong. It is based on the presumption that
the more VAERS" reports a vaccine lot is associated with, the more dangerous
the vaccine in that lot; and that by consulting a list showing the number of
VAERS reports per lot, a parent can identify vaccine lots to avoid.
This is misleading for two reasons:
1. VAERS is a system for reporting events that are temporally
associated with receipt of vaccine; VAERS reports should not be
interpreted to imply causality. In other words, a VAERS report does
not mean that the vaccine caused the event. Statistically, a certain
number of serious illnesses, even deaths, can be expected to occur by
chance alone among children recently vaccinated. While vaccines are
known to cause minor, temporary side effects like soreness or fever,
there is little, if any, evidence linking vaccination with permanent
health problems or death. The point is that just because an adverse
event has been reported to VAERS, it does not mean it was caused by
a vaccine.
2. Vaccine lots are not the same. The sizes of vaccine lots might vary
from several hundred thousand doses to several million, and some are
in distribution much longer than others. Naturally a larger lot or one
that is in distribution longer will be associated with more adverse
events, simply by chance. Also, more coincidental deaths are
associated with vaccines given in infancy than later in childhood,
since the background death rates in children are highest during the
first year of life. So knowing that lot A has been associated with x
number of adverse events while lot B has been associated with y
number would not necessarily tell you anything about the relative
safety of the two lots, even if the vaccine did cause the events.
Reviewing published lists of "hot lots" will not help parents identify the best or
worst vaccines for their children. If the number and type of VAERS reports for a
particular vaccine lot suggested that it was associated with more serious adverse
events or deaths than are expected by chance, FDA has the legal authority to
immediately recall that lot. To date, no vaccine lot in the modern era has been
"The Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) receives reports,
from either providers or patients, of adverse events that occur after the
administration of any vaccine.


## p. (#526) ################################################

found to be unsafe on the basis of VAERS reports.
Every vaccine manufacturing facility and vaccine product is licensed by the FDA.
In addition, every vaccine lot is safety-tested by the manufacturer. The results of
these tests are reviewed by FDA, who may repeat some of these tests as an
additional protective measure. FDA also inspects vaccine-manufacturing facilities
regularly to ensure adherence to manufacturing procedures and product-testing
regulations, and reviews the weekly VAERS reports for each lot searching for
unusual patterns. FDA would recall a lot of vaccine at the first sign of problems.
There is no benefit to either the FDA or the manufacturer in allowing unsafe
vaccine to remain on the market. And since vaccines are given to otherwise
healthy children, the American public would not tolerate them if they did not have
to conform to the most rigorous safety standards. The mere fact is that a vaccine
lot still in distribution says that it is considered safe by the FDA.


## p. (#527) ################################################

4. Vaccines couse many hormful side effects, illnesses, and even death — not
to mention possible long-term effects we don't even know about.
Vaccines are actually very safe, despite implications to the contrary in much anti-
vaccine literature (which sometimes quotes the number of reports received by
VAERS, and allows the reader to infer that they all represent genuine vaccine
side-effects). The vast majority of vaccine adverse events are minor and
;
temporary, like a sore arm or mild fever. These can often be controlled by taking
acetaminophen before or after vaccination. More serious adverse events occur
rarely (on the order of one per thousands to one per millions of doses), and some
are so rare that risk cannot be accurately assessed. As to vaccines causing death,
again there are so few deaths that could plausibly be attributed to vaccines that it
is hard to assess the risk statistically. Of all deaths reported to VAERS between
1990 and 1992, only one is believed to be even possibly associated with a vaccine.
Each death reported to VAERS is thoroughly examined to ensure that it is not
related to a new vaccine-related problem, but little or no evidence exists to suggest
that vaccines have contributed to any of the reported deaths. The Institute of
Medicine in its 1994 report states that the risk of death from vaccines is
"extraordinarily low."
DTP Vaccine and SIDS
One myth that won't seem to go away is that DTP vaccine causes
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). This belief came about because
a moderate proportion of SIDS deaths occur in children who have
recently been vaccinated with DTP; and on the surface, this seems to
point toward a causal connection. But this logic is faulty; you might as
well say that eating bread causes car crashes, since most drivers who
crash their cars could probably be shown to have eaten bread within the
past 24 hours.
If you consider that most SIDS deaths occur during the same range of
ages when 3 shots of DTP are given, you would expect DTP shots to
precede a fair number of SIDS deaths simply by chance. In fact, when a
number of well-controlled studies were conducted during the 1980's,
they found, nearly unanimously, that the number of SIDS deaths
temporally associated with DTP vaccination was within the range
expected to occur by chance. In other words, the SIDS deaths would
have occurred even if no vaccinations had been given. In fact, in several
of the studies children who had recently gotten a DTP shot were less
likely to get SIDS. The Institute of Medicine reports that "all controlled
studies that have compared immunized versus nonimmunized children
have found either no association . . . or a decreased risk . . . of SIDS
among immunized children," and concludes that "the evidence does not
indicate a causal relation between [DTP) vaccine and SIDS."



## p. (#528) ################################################

But looking at risk alone is not enough — you must always look at both risks and
benefits. Even one serious adverse effect in a million doses of vaccine cannot be
justified if there is no benefit from the vaccination. If there were no vaccines,
there would be many more cases of disease, and along with them, more serious
side effects, including death. For example, an analysis of the benefit and risk of
DTP immunization has concluded that without an immunization program there
could be a 71-fold increase in cases of pertussis and a nearly 4-fold increase in
deaths due to pertussis in the United States. A comparison of the risk from
disease with the risk from the vaccines that protect against them can give us an
idea of the benefits we get from vaccinating our children.

The fact is that a child is far more likely to be seriously injured by one of these
diseases than by any vaccine. While any serious injury or death caused by
vaccines is too many, it is also clear that the benefits of vaccination greatly
outweigh the slight risk, and that many, many more injuries and deaths would
occur without them. In fact, to have a medical intervention as effective in
preventing disease as vaccination and not use it would be unconscionable.
Research is underway by the U.S. Public Health Service to better understand
which vaccine adverse events are truly caused by vaccines and how to reduce the
already low risk of serious vaccine-related injury even further.

5. Vaccine-preventable diseases have been virtually eliminated from the
United States, so there is no need for my child to be voccinoted.
It's true that vaccination has enabled us to reduce most vaccine-preventable
diseases to very low levels in the United States. However, some of them are still
quite prevalent — even epidemic — in other parts of the world. Travellers can
unknowingly bring these diseases into the U.S., and if we were not protected by
vaccinations these diseases could quickly spread throughout the population,
causing epidemics here. At the same time, the relatively few cases we currently
have in the U.S. could very quickly become tens or hundreds of thousands of cases
without the protection we get from vaccines.
We should still be vaccinated, then, for two reasons. The first is to protect
ourselves. Even if we think our chances of getting any of these diseases is small,
the diseases still exist and can still infect anyone who is not protected. A few
years ago in California a child who had just entered school caught diphtheria and
died. He was the only unvaccinated pupil in his class.
The second reason to get vaccinated is to protect those around us. There is a
small number of people who cannot be vaccinated (because of severe allergies to
vaccine components, for example), and a small percentage of vaccine failures.
These people are susceptible to disease, and their only hope of protection is that
people around them are immune and cannot pass disease along to them. A
successful vaccination program, like a successful society, depends on the
cooperation of every individual to ensure the good of all. We would think it
irresponsible of a driver to ignore all traffic regulations on the presumption that
other drivers will watch out for him. In the same way we shouldn't rely on people
around us to stop the spread of disease without doing what we can as well.


## p. (#530) ################################################

6. Giving a child multiple vaccinations for different diseases at the same time
increases the risk of hormful side effects dnd con overlood the immune system.
Children are exposed to many foreign antigens every day. Routine consumption of
food introduces new bacteria into the body, and numerous bacteria live in the
mouth and nose, exposing the immune system to still more antigens. An upper
respiratory viral infection exposes a child to between 4 and 10 antigens, and a
case of "strep throat" to between 25 and 50. According to the Institute of
Medicine's 1994 report, Adverse Events Associated with Childhood Vaccines, "In
the face of these normal events, it seems unlikely that the number of separate
antigens contained in childhood vaccines . . . would represent an appreciable
added burden on the immune system that would be immunosuppressive." And,
indeed, available scientific data show no adverse effects of simultaneous
vaccination with multiple vaccines on the normal childhood immune system.
A number of studies have been conducted to examine the effects of giving various
combinations of vaccines simultaneously. In fact, neither the Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) nor the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
would recommend simultaneous administration of any vaccines until such studies
showed the combinations to be both safe and effective. These studies have shown
that the recommended vaccines are as effective in combination as they are
individually, and that such combinations cause no greater risk for adverse side
effects. Consequently, both the ACIP and AAP recommend simultaneous
administration of all routine childhood vaccines when appropriate. Research is
currently underway to find ways to combine more antigens in a single vaccine
injection (for example, MMR and chickenpox). This will assure all the advantages
of the individual vaccines, but require fewer shots.
There are two practical factors in favor of giving a child several vaccinations
during the same visit. First, we want to immunize children as early as possible to
give them protection during the vulnerable early months of their lives. This
generally means giving inactivated vaccines beginning at 2 months and live
vaccines at 12 months. Therefore, doses the various vaccines tend to fall due at
the same time. Second, if we can give several vaccinations at the same time it
will mean fewer office visits for vaccinations, which saves parents both time and
money and may be less traumatic for the child.

( DC Concerns about Vaccine Contamination
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL Questions and Answers
AND PREVENTION
What evidence is there that vaccines are contaminated with agents that can
transmit infectious diseases?
There is no evidence that currently available vaccines are contaminated with
infectious agents that cause disease. Today, manufacturers are required to test cell
lines used in the production of vaccines for the presence of a variety of infectious
agents, to prevent contamination of vaccine products.
Reverse transcriptase (RT)
e Vaccines produced using chick embryo may contain minute quantities of an
avian enzyme necessary for a retrovirus to reproduce. This enzyme does
not confirm the presence of a retrovirus. In addition, this enzyme is not
derived from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a well-known
retrovirus.
Reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme necessary for retroviruses, which are found in many
different species, to reproduce. RT is not infectious in humans or animals, and it has not been
shown to cause any adverse health effects in people. Using a highly sensitive polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) based assay, RT activity has been detected in minute quantities in vaccines
manufactured with chick embryo fibroblasts. The source of the enzyme is probably a partial
viral genome coding for RT, believed to be integrated into chick cells hundreds or thousands of
years ago. Avian retroviruses that produce this RT are not known to affect humans. While the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that leads to AIDS, is a retrovirus, the RT
activity detected in vaccines is definitively not derived from HIV. Furthermore, the presence of
RT does not confirm the presence of a retrovirus.
Among vaccines with evidence of RT are the measles, mumps, influenza, and yellow fever
vaccines. The presence of RT does not necessarily indicate the presence of a retrovirus that
could cause infection or lead to illness in humans. In fact, investigations of the vaccines and the
chick cells from which they were produced, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and others, have found no
evidence of an infectious, transmissible retrovirus.



## p. (#532) ################################################

“Stealth” virus
e There is no evidence that polio vaccine, or any other vaccine, has been
contaminated with a “stealth” virus. To our knowledge, existence of this
virus has not been confirmed by other investigators.
“Stealth” virus is the label that one researcher has given to a cytopathic virus he has described.
He has suggested that such viruses may reside within the body without being detected by the
immune system. There is no evidence that polio vaccine, or any other vaccine, has been
contaminated with a “stealth” virus. To our knowledge, existence of this virus has not been
confirmed by other investigators.
The researcher reports that the “stealth” virus or a related virus has been cultured from the tissues
of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and other chronic neuropsychiatric and autoimmune
conditions. He further suggests that the “stealth” virus could be the cause of these illnesses.
These findings have not been confirmed by any other investigators. Moreover, it has been stated
that the same researcher found similar rates of viral detection among persons with chronic fatigue
syndrome and control persons without these illnesses in a blinded study. If a “stealth” virus were
a cause of these illnesses, higher rates of infection would be expected among ill persons,
compared with healthy control subjects.
He has reported that a partial sequence of this virus is like that of simian cytomegalovirus
(SCMV) and suggests that the source of the SCMV-like virus is the African Green monkey.
Because African Green monkey kidney cells are used in production of live oral polio vaccine, he
hypothesized that the SCMV-like virus (“stealth” virus) may be an adventitious agent in polio
vaccines. Offers to confirm this researcher’s results in independent laboratories have not been
accepted.
In July 1996, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health convened a workshop to review
some of this scientist’s observations. The results presented were considered inconclusive. The
need for sharing among scientists of methods and reagents was emphasized so that other workers
might independently evaluate the methods and conclusions. FDA considers that the methods
applied by the manufacturer to test for SCMV in polio vaccine would detect replicating SCMV.
Simian virus 40 (SV40)
e This virus has no relationship to HIV or simian immunodeficiency virus
(SIV). In the early 1960s, some lots of polio vaccines were discovered to
contain SV40. Since 1961, manufacturers have been required by the Food
and Drug Administration to test for SV 40. There is limited evidence that
SV40 can infect humans, but there is no evidence it causes human health
problems.
Simian virus 40 was discovered in the early 1960s to be present in some lots of polio vaccines It
was found in the inactivated (injectable) polio vaccine and Some experimental lots of oral polio
vaccine. The polio vaccine was manufactured in kidney cells from simians (monkeys) that
harbored SV40. The control methods used before this time did not identify this adventitious
agent. The formalin inactivation process used to kill the poliovirus was found not to inactivate


## p. (#533) ################################################

the SV40 completely. Beginning in 1961, manufacturers have been required by FDA to test for
SV40, using modified methods and different cell cultures, and lots positive for SV40 are not
released. A few years later, the source of monkeys used for production was changed to species
that do not harbor SV40.
SV40 is a polyomavirus. It has no relationship to HIV or simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV;
the virus that causes AIDS in monkeys. SV40 can cause cancer in laboratory animals. Limited
evidence suggests that SV40 can infect humans, but there is no evidence that it causes human
health problems. Recent publications have identified SV40 DNA sequences in samples of tissue
from rare human tumors, including choroid plexus tumors, mesotheliomas, ependymomas, and
osteosarcomas, as well as in apparently normal (non-neoplastic) human tissue. However, this
finding has not been confirmed by some investigators. SV40 has been isolated from one human
choroid plexus tumor. Several epidemiologic studies have failed to find an association in
humans who received polio vaccine containing SV40 and development of any type of cancer.
People who received polio vaccine between 1954 and 1962 may have received a dose that
contained SV40. As many as 10 to 30 million persons in the U.S. could have received SV40-
contaminated injectable polio vaccine. The participants of several clinical trials (approximately
10,000 persons) may have received oral polio vaccine that was contaminated with SV40. Studies
in the U.S. have shown no increased rates of cancer among persons who would have received
polio vaccine between 1954 and 1962; similarly, studies in Sweden have not shown any
increased risk for cancers among people exposed to vaccines potentially containing SV40,
compared with people who were not exposed to these vaccines. Moreover, there is no evidence
that polio vaccine administered since the early 1960s contained SV40. For decades,
manufacturers have been required by FDA to test for SV40 using infectivity assays.
Fetal tissue
e Fetal tissue is not used to produce vaccines; cell lines generated from a
single fetal tissue source are used--vaccine manufacturers obtain human cell
lines from FDA-certified cell banks.
Fetal Tissue and Vaccines. Some vaccines such as rubella and varicella are made from human
cell-line cultures, and some of these cell lines originated from aborted fetal tissue, obtained from
legal abortions in the 1960s. No new fetal tissue is needed to produce cell lines to make these
vaccines, now or in the future. Fetal tissue is not used to produce vaccines; cell lines generated
from a single fetal tissue source are used.--vaccine manufacturers obtain human cell lines from
FDA-certified cell banks.
In 1964, there were an estimated 20,000 babies born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in
the United States. When women contract rubella disease during early pregnancy, this often
causes miscarriage or neurological damage to the unborn child, resulting in the child suffering
blindness, deafness and retardation. In 1993, the number of CRS cases was seven, reflecting a
99.9% reduction in this preventable disease since 1964.
In 1996, CDC, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family
Physicians jointly recommended routine use of varicella vaccine to protect children from chicken


## p. (#534) ################################################

pox. In March 1995, this vaccine was licensed for use in the United States by the FDA and was
shown to be safe and effective. Widespread use of varicella vaccine--which took more than 20
years for the development, testing, and licensing--can help prevent thousands of children from
being hospitalized each year because of complications from chicken pox. Complications include
secondary infections such as group A streptococcal infections that can lead to necrotizing
fasciitis, multiple organ failure, shock, and death. In the United States each year, from 50 to 100
previously healthy children or adults die from complications associated with their chickenpox
illness.
Precautions Against Contamination
O Vaccines are safe and effective. The FDA requires manufacturers to adhere
to numerous procedures to protect its purity and safety when producing
vaccines. All vaccines undergo rigorous clinical trials for safety and
effectiveness before being licensed by the FDA for use in the United States.
FDA has many procedures in place, designed to detect and prevent the presence of adventitious
agents in vaccines. These procedures include characterizations of the cell substrates used for
vaccine production as well as testing the products by specified methods. For example,
manufacturers today are required to test the cell lines (monkey kidney cells) used for the
production of poliovirus vaccines for a variety of infectious agents: tuberculosis, SV40, herpes
viruses (including simian cytomegalovirus), Coxsackie virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus, measles, and others. Cell (tissue) culture tests must show an absence of cytopathogenic
effects. Adult and suckling animals are also used to screen for viable microbial agents. A
neurovirulence safety test is conducted for live oral poliovirus vaccine. The cell substrates used
for measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine are derived from flocks free of avian leukosis virus.
MMR vaccine also undergoes extensive testing for adventitious viral activity.
As technology improves, the FDA may require the application of new methods to screen for
infectious agents in vaccines. Experimental assays have been applied by FDA on an ad hoc basis.
For example, RT and PCR methods have been applied to some monopools' of polio vaccine to
assure the absence of SIV and HIV. Other vaccines have been examined using other highly
sensitive PCR methods.
For more information about vaccines and vaccinations, contact CDC’s National
Immunization Information Hotline: 1-800-232-2522, English, or 1-800-232-0233, Spanish;
or visit CDC’s Internet page www.cdc.gov
"There are three types of polio: Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. During vaccine production, vaccines for the three types
are produced separately, each being a monopool. The three monopools are then combined to produce the polio vaccine, which is
a trivalent vaccine.

C Chemical Additives in Vaccines
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL
AND PREVENTION
Why are chemicals added to vaccines?
Many things in today's world, including foods and medicines, have chemicals
added to them to prevent the growth of germs and reduce spoilage.
Chemicals are added to vaccines for the same reasons, to prevent growth of
bacteria, helping to preserve the vaccine and prevent it from losing its potency
Over time.
What chemicals are found in vaccines?
e Antibiotics are added to vaccines to prevent the growth of germs (bacteria) in
vaccine cultures. Neomycin is one of the more common antibiotics used for this
purpose. Penicillin is not used in vaccines today because of the number of
persons with sensitivities to penicillin.
o Aluminum gels or salts of aluminum are added as adjuvants to help the vaccine
stimulate production of antibodies to fight off diseases. Adjuvants are substances
that aid other substances in their action. In vaccines, adjuvants may be added to
help promote an earlier response, more potent response or more persistent
immune response to disease.
e Formaldehyde is used to kill unwanted viruses and bacteria that might be found
in cultures used to produce vaccines.
o Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is used as a stabilizer in a few vaccines.
Stabilizers help the vaccine remain unchanged even in the presence of forces
that would normally change the vaccine's state or condition (such as heat, light,
acidity, humidity etc.). Monosodium Glutamate is also found in many foods
especially oriental foods.
o Sulfites such as sodium metabisulfite are also stabilizers. Sulfites might be
added to some vaccines to help stabilize and preserve the vaccine if it were
exposed to adverse conditions. Sulfites are also found in many foods and some
alcoholic beverages.
e Thimerosal is a preservative that might be added to help keep the vaccine from
spoiling. Thimerosal contains mercury and is made from a combination of ethyl
mercuric chloride, thiosalicylic acid, sodium hydroxide and ethanol. Thimerosal
is also found in contact lens solutions and throat sprays.

How can I find out what chemical additives are in specific vaccines?
Ask your health care provider or pharmacist for a copy of the vaccine package insert.
The package insert lists ingredients in the vaccine and discusses any known adverse
reactions.
Should l stop taking vaccinations if I am allergic to any of these chemicals?
Persons who have allergies to chemicals may not have a reaction to these same
chemicals in vaccines. The amount of chemical additives found in vaccines is very
small and may not be enough to cause a serious allergic response. However, if you
have concerns about receiving a vaccination, you should always discuss it with your
health care provider. You should also consult your health care provider if you have had
any reaction to a vaccine in the past.
Many scientist and physicians believe that your risk of having a serious illness or death
from diseases that vaccines protect you from is much greater than your risk of having
serious side effects from any chemical additives found in vaccines.

CDC CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL
Vaccines and Chronic Disease
AND PREVENTION
Q. Do vaccines cause chronic diseases, such as autism, diabetes, Crohn’s disease, AIDS,
and cancer?
A. After decades of vaccine use in the United States, the current research
shows no conclusive evidence proving vaccines cause chronic illness. Vaccine
safety research--including research into theories linking vaccines to chronic
diseases--is being conducted on a regular basis in the United States and overseas
to make sure the public is receiving the safest possible vaccine.
e In some instances, researchers have published articles on their studies that support their
theories about vaccine and chronic illness; however, when other researchers attempt to
duplicate their results (the test of good research), they can’t. Medical conclusions about
the safety of vaccines or the cause of a disease must be judged on the quality of the
scientific research and the weight of evidence.
e Because no vaccine is without risk, when medical and public health professionals
recommend vaccines for infants and children to protect children against serious infectious
diseases, they must balance the scientific evidence of benefits, costs, and risks.
e The balance of benefits and risks can change as diseases are controlled or eradicated. For
example, smallpox has been eradicated worldwide and the risk of complications
associated with smallpox vaccine now outweigh any theoretical risk of contracting
smallpox or related virus for the general population. Therefore, smallpox vaccine is no
longer recommended.
e CDC believes that parents should be fully informed about the risks and benefits of
vaccination and should talk to their child’s trusted health care provider.

Immunization Resources You Need To Know About
Deborah L. Wexler, MD
A 10-month-old Mexican immigrant child is brought to your clinic with the following
immunization history: oral poliovirus vaccine at birth and 1, 2, and 4 months of age;
diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine at 2 and 4 months of age; and one measles vaccine at
9 months of age. What vaccines does this child need? How many more doses of polio,
Haemophilus influenzae type b, and measles-mumps-rubella vaccines? Does the single-
antigen measles vaccine count as a dose? What about hepatitis B and varicella? When
should you tell the parent to bring the child back to the office?
If you don’t know the answers to these questions, what immunization resources
do you turn to? The following two excellent resources, The 1997 Red Book and the
Summary of Rules for Childhood Immunization will answer your questions...and more.
The 1997 Red Book—The Report of the Committee on Infectious Diseases
This publication (Committee on Infectious Diseases, American Academy of Pediatrics
[AAP], Elk Grove Village, Ill., 1997) is the pediatrician's definitive immunization
reference guide. Written, edited, and reviewed by some of the leading immunization
experts in the United States, it can help answer nearly all of your questions about
immunization and the prevention and management of infectious diseases. It describes the
AAP's recommendations and rationale for various childhood immunizations. No clinic
seeing children should be without this resource. Call the AAP at 800-433-9016 to order a
copy.

Summary of Rules for Childhood Immunization
This popular, single-page document will help you quickly and accurately assess almost
every child’s immunization needs. Published by the Immunization Action Coalition
(IAC), this two-sided reference table consolidates the complicated recommendations for
immunization, such as at what ages to give vaccines, what to do if children have fallen
behind in their immunizations, and precautions and contraindications. It has been
reviewed for technical accuracy by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) and a host of nationally renowned immunization experts.
There are other excellent resources that health care professionals need in order to
have the tools necessary to improve childhood immunization rates. In my opinion, the
best immunization resources come from “The Big Five”—the CDC, the IAC, the AAP,
state health departments, and the vaccine manufacturers.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
The CDC offers many services and references, including those listed below.
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Statements
ACIP statements are published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).
They are easily obtained by the following methods:
• If you want new ACIP recommendations as soon as they are released, go to the
CDC's Web site at ‘www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/mmwr.html>. You can also request
a free electronic subscription to MMWR at this site.
• Call CDC’s immunization hotline at 800-232–2522.
• E-mail your request to <nipinfo@cdc.gov-.
• Call your state immunization program.

Varicella is ubiquitous, leading to 50-100 deaths each year in the U.S. It is communicable before
the rash and can be spread by airborne droplet as well as direct contact. The vaccine is composed of
live virus, has 95% efficacy (breakthrough disease is mild), and is recommended for
immunocompetent: (1) children 12-18 months of age, (2) susceptible persons at high risk of
exposure or severe illness, and (3) susceptible persons likely to expose persons at high risk of severe
illness (e.g., health care workers). Immunity appears to be long-lasting. Zoster is more severe and
is 4-5 times more likely after natural disease than after immunization.
Acellular pertussis vaccine is purified subunit vaccine, has 71-84% clinical efficacy, and,
although the schedule and precautions/contraindications are the same, it is preferred over whole cell
vaccine because it causes fewer adverse reactions. 4" dose tip. This can be given if child is at least
12 months old and it’s been at least 6 months since DTaP3. 5" dose tips: This should be given if
DTaP4 was before 4" birthday. Tripedia and Infanrix are not yet licensed for 5" dose if all
preceding doses were DTaP; all brands are acceptable for the 5" dose if a preceding dose was whole
cell. DTaP-Hib is ONLY licensed for the 4" dose.
Polio is being eradicated! To reduce the number of number of people who get polio from (live)
OPV while keeping gut immunity high, the ACIP has recommended an interim IPV-IPV-OPV-OPV
schedule. The U.S. will be moving toward an all IPV schedule.
Hepatitis B still causes 5,000-6,000 deaths each year in the US. All infants and teens should get
this inactivated vaccine. Perinatally exposed neonates & persons at continued risk of exposure
(e.g., health care workers) should get post-vaccination testing (1-2 months after the 3" dose; no
additional testing if anti-HBSAg is +). Neonates should be at least 2000 grams before getting
routine Hep B vaccination; still give these neonates Hep B vaccine and HBIG if the mother is
acutely or chronically infected.


## p. (#556) ################################################

Influenza vaccine is inactivated so it CAN'T CAUSE FLU! It's efficacy is best in healthy
people and against hospitalization and death in the elderly. It is recommended for (1) everyone at
risk of serious disease or complications (e.g., 2 65 yrs old, chronic illness, pregnant women, at least
6 months old on chronic aspirin), (2) everyone who surrounds immunodeficient people in #1 above
(e.g., health care workers), and (3) everyone who doesn’t want to get flu. Immunity is not
immediate and it lasts * 1 year. Vaccinate annually in the fall. A live intra-nasal vaccine for
children is being tested.
Pneumococcal disease is a big killer and it may be worse as antibiotic effectiveness is
challenged. The vaccine is inactivated polysaccharide vaccine that is 60-70% effective against
invasive disease. One dose and selective one time re-vaccination is recommended. It is
recommended for people at risk because of chronic illness, old age, or immunocompromise. A
conjugated vaccine that can be used in children less than 2 years old is being tested.
Td, a toxoid, is now recommended to be part of the 11-12 year visit if at least 5 years have passed
since the preceding dose.
MMR, is a live vaccine. Egg allergy IS NOT a contraindication, but gelatin allergy and severe
immunosuppression are contraindications. What is proof of immunity for people born 1957 or
more recently?
Acceptable ‘proof Measles Mumps Rubella
Documented case ºf ºf NO
Birth before 1957 ºf ºf **:::::::::::-"
Serologic testing ºf ºf */
Doses of vaccine 2 doses 1 dose 1 dose
Being born before 1957 does not insure immunity, so women who may become pregnant should be
tested and/or vaccinated for rubella.
Hepatitis A vaccine is inactivated whole virus, has 94-100% clinical efficacy, and is
recommended for persons at high risk of exposure (e.g., children - 2 yrs old in communities with
high rates of Hep A, homosexual men, drug users, people with occupational risk (not HCWs) or
severe illness (e.g., chronic liver disease patients).

Rotavirus Disease and Vaccine
*Background Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children in the
U.S. Rotavirus is estimated to account for about 50,000 hospitalizations each year among children ‘ 5 years
fold. Rotavirus also accounts for about 500,000 physician visits each year, and 20-40 children die each year
from rotavirus disease.
Rotashield vaccine is also know as RRV-TV, which stands for rhesus rotavirus tetravalent. It is a live oral
vaccine. The vaccine contains four viruses that express the most common rotavirus VP7 antigens, serotypes
G1, G2, G3, and G4. The vaccine has been found to be 49-68% effective in preventing any rotavirus diarrhea
and 64-91% effective in preventing severe diarrhea.
At it's June 1998 meeting, the ACIP voted to recommend routine immunization of all full term infants with 3
doses of rotavirus vaccine. The vaccine should be administered at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, and should be
given simultaneously with other vaccines given at these ages.
Rotavirus schedule. Efforts should be made to complete the series prior to the winter rotavirus season. If an
accelerated schedule is needed to accomplish this, the minimum interval between doses is 3 weeks. The
minimum age of the first dose of rotavirus vaccine is 6 weeks. Information available now indicates that
infants given their first dose of rotavirus vaccine after 6 month of age have an increased risk of fever, so the
maximum age of the 1st dose is 6 months. The maximum age for the 3rd dose is 12 months of age, even if the
~child hasn’t completed the 3 dose series. There isn’t enough safety & efficacy data right now to recommend
the vaccine for these older children.
Adverse reactions. The most common adverse reaction has been fever. Temperature of 238°C attributable
* to the vaccine was reported in 3-25% of vaccine recipients, fever usually occurring 3-5 days after the 1st dose.
Contraindications and precautions. Rotavirus vaccine is a live virus vaccine, so contraindications to it’s use
- are somewhat similar to other live virus vaccines.
º
“ As with all vaccines, a severe allergic
reaction to a prior dose, or a vaccine
component is a contraindication.
* Known or suspected immunodeficiency is
also a contraindication to vaccination.
Infants born to women with HIV infection
should not be vaccinated unless the it is
established that the child is NOT HIV
infected. Healthy infants with an
immunocompromised household member
should be vaccinated as usual.
* Children with moderate or severe acute
illness should not be vaccinated until their
illness improves.
* Infants with persistent vomiting should
not be routinely vaccinated.
And the efficacy of the vaccine among infants
with ongoing diarrhea is not known, so it is
prudent to avoid vaccination of these children
until the illness improves.
There are few data on the use of rotavirus
vaccine among premature infants. So infants
born at less than 37 weeks gestation should not
be routinely vaccined. Providers may decide to
give the vaccine if the benefit clearly outweighs
the risk.
The vaccine safety and efficacy vaccine among
children with chronic gastrointestinal disease

consider the benefits and risks of vaccination.
Breast feeding is not a contraindication.
