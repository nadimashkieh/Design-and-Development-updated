PREFACE
The 1994 National Vaccine Plan illustrates clearly the U.S. Government's commitment to rational reform
of the health care system. For the first time in the Nation's history, the plan provides a framework in which
diverse domestic and international, public- and private-sector activities in immunization and vaccine development
can be effectively coordinated to achieve their ultimate public health goal - the safe and effective prevention of
infectious diseases.
This document responds to the mandate of Congress contained in P.L. 99-660, in which the vision of a
National Vaccine Program (NVP) was first outlined. This first plan ~ the 1994 plan - is an initial step in
forging a truly integrated national effort to give all Americans the fullest possible protection.
As reflected in the plan, statutory responsibility for public health in the United States rests with States;
in the promotion and delivery of immunization, States and municipalities have played a pivotal role, which this «
plan envisages continuing. Some Federal agencies have also traditionally played an important part in combating
infectious diseases, through research on vaccines or support of vaccination efforts, and the plan outlines priorities
for Federal activities. The plan also acknowledges the critical role played by the private sector in vaccine
development and immunization. Vaccine companies develop, request licensure for, and supply vaccines under
those circumstances in which they believe a commercially viable product is feasible. Private-sector health care
providers deliver a large proportion of vaccinations. These private-sector contributions are essential parts of the
collective national effort. Through further discussions with the private sector, we hope to identify optimal
approaches to public/private collaboration on the development of vaccines, particularly for diseases where
commercial viability may be uncertain, and on the effective delivery of vaccinations. Future plans will reflect
these deliberations. In addition, they will relate Federal agency activities more specifically to overall NVP goals
and objectives.
This plan describes the way in which the United States should promote immunization to protect the
health of all people. Promoting immunization will ensure that we achieve the full benefits of those vaccines
already licensed. Accelerating the development and use of promising new and improved vaccine candidates will
mean that their benefits will reach the American public that much sooner.
The challenge to the Federal Government is to implement the National Vaccine Program - effectively
and efficiently - to achieve the goals outlined in this plan. The President's proposal for a Childhood
Immunization Initiative and congressional commitment of the necessary resources already represent significant
steps made toward meeting the Nation's health goals. /J . yj

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Vaccines hold enormous potential for the control of infectious diseases and their costs. However,
despite many significant accomplishments in vaccine development and immunization and clear evidence of their
benefit and cost-effectiveness, the potential of vaccines to avert suffering and death remains underexploited both
domestically and globally. Infectious diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide, and many newly
emerging or reemerging infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and drug-resistant tuberculosis,
threaten human health.
Vaccines need to be developed for many infectious diseases such as childhood pneumococcal and viral
respiratory diseases, diarrheas, and sexually transmitted diseases including HIV. Vaccines for other diseases,
such as malaria, are especially needed for people in developing countries and for travelers to endemic areas. The
use of all existing vaccines — whether for children or adults - needs to be improved. For example, in the
United States, more individuals (or parents) need to seek vaccination, and health care providers need to avoid
missing opportunities to vaccinate. New biotechnology approaches to making vaccines and new techniques for
understanding pathogens and the human immune system already offer the opportunity, if they are applied
energetically on a broad front, for there to be an unprecedented wave of vaccine development. Yet vaccine
innovation, improvement, and progress in use remain slower than public health experts feel is desirable.
The process of disease prevention through vaccine research, development, licensure, manufacturing, and
delivery to vaccinees through the health system entails complex collaborative efforts between the many public-
and private-sector participants at the various stages of the process. There has existed for some time the feeling
that progress in disease prevention would be greater if ways could be found to bring greater cohesion to the
individual activities of those participating in these efforts. In P.L. 99-660, Congress created the National
Vaccine Program - a cross-departmental, multi-agency collaboration led by the Public Health Service's National
Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) - as a vehicle for coordination and intervention to meet public health needs in
the prevention of infectious diseases.
The National Vaccine Plan provides a framework - including goals, objectives, and strategies - for
pursuing the prevention of infectious diseases under which Federal agencies, States, municipalities, and those in
the private sector, such as vaccine companies and health care providers, can undertake their individual activities
in a more coordinated manner. The plan also indicates how the United States can contribute to, and benefit
from, global efforts in the prevention of infectious diseases. It identifies four goals responding to P.L. 99-660
and the National Vaccine Program's ultimate mission of preventing infectious diseases:
Goal 1: Develop new and improved vaccines;
Goal 2: Ensure optimal safety and effectiveness of vaccines and immunization;
Goal 3: Better educate the public and members of the health professions on the benefits and risks of
immunizations; and
Goal 4: Achieve better use of existing vaccines to prevent disease, disability, and death.
The objectives related to these goals are shown in the accompanying summary table. The NVPO provides
leadership, oversight, and coordination among Federal agencies.

PRIORITIES
Immediate priorities for FY 1994 and FT 1995 have been established for pursuit of the plan's goals. These
priorities reflect the fact that improved protection against infectious diseases can rapidly be achieved by better
use of existing vaccines in immunization programs and that improving on protection possible with currently
licensed vaccines will require the development of improved and new vaccines.
Immunization
The U.S. measles epidemics of 1989-91, with over 55,000 cases and 136 deaths, have shown that many of
the Nation's children are at risk of preventable diseases because they are not vaccinated on the proper schedule
during the critical first two years of life. Hence, the President has proposed and Congress has appropriated funds
for a Childhood Immunization Initiative (CII). The aim of the CII is to eliminate childhood cases of six vaccine-
preventable diseases, namely, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis, measles, poliomyelitis,
rubella (German measles), and tetanus, and to significantly reduce the occurrence of three other diseases, namely,
pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B, and mumps, by 1996. This aim will be accomplished by increasing
vaccination coverage levels to at least 90 percent among 2-year-old children by 1996 for each of the vaccinations
routinely recommended, and by establishing a vaccination delivery system that maintains and further improves
high coverage levels. CII activities under goals 3 and 4 of the National Vaccine Plan will focus on
o Improving the infrastructure for providing vaccines;
o Increasing community participation and parent/provider education;
o Reducing vaccine cost for parents;
o Improving the monitoring of vaccination coverage and disease; and
o Improving vaccines and vaccination schedules.
The activities of the CII lay the groundwork for a general enhancement of immunization; during FY
1994 and FY 1995, the NVPO with other agencies will identify steps that Federal agencies can take to
implement the National Vaccine Advisory Committee report on "Adult Immunization."
Vaccine Development
Priorities in the development of new or improved vaccines for general use include focusing on HIV and
other sexually transmitted diseases, influenza (improved), malaria, pneumococcal disease (in young children),
pertussis (improved), rotavirus and shigella diarrheas, streptococcal disease (group B), and tuberculosis. The
plan also places emphasis on combination vaccines that can simplify vaccination delivery; such improvements to
make delivery easier are included in the CII. Priority also will be given to selected activities directed toward
understanding pathogens and immunity, strengthening vaccine testing and assessment capabilities, and evaluating
and improving vaccine safety.
Policy Development
The NVPO in collaboration with National Vaccine Program participating agencies will address cross-
cutting policy issues relevant to disease prevention. These include public/private sector collaboration in vaccine
development, including the priorities of the global Children's Vaccine Initiative; Federal technology transfer for
vaccine development; and other issues where interagency coordination in policy development is desirable, such as
in the introduction of new vaccines.

ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES
Provision of adequate resources to make possible the vigorous and comprehensive pursuit of the wide
range of activities outlined in the National Vaccine Plan could result in substantial health benefits for the
American people by the year 2000. These benefits are expected to be realized as the following outcomes:
o Age-appropriate immunization with all recommended vaccines will be extended to at least 90
percent of infants and children, and access to affordable vaccination services will be made available
for every person in the United States.
o Diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, rubella, mumps, some forms of hepatitis, pertussis
(whooping cough), and bacterial meningitis (from Haemophilus influenzae type b) will be
essentially eliminated as significant causes of death, disease, and disability in the United States.
o Educational communication networks will be in place that will inform all health care providers,
communities, and families of the benefits and risks of vaccination.
o In a global context, polio will be drastically reduced, if not eliminated, and neonatal tetanus and
measles will be better controlled.
o Pneumococcal pneumonia and influenza in American adults over the age of 65 will be significantly
reduced.
o A nationwide system will monitor the vaccines that children receive, and will remind parents when
individual infants and children should be vaccinated.
o A nationwide surveillance system will report and investigate cases of vaccine-preventable diseases.
o Vaccine safety and efficacy will be continuously monitored, and adverse events following
immunization will be reported and carefully analyzed.
o Improved vaccines will replace some of the vaccines in current use.
o Some vaccines requiring multiple doses and multiple contacts with the health care system will be
replaced by more cost-effective ones that will improve people's access to immunization.
o Many new vaccines will be developed, or be much closer to licensure, for diseases for which
effective vaccines do not now exist.
o New mechanisms for the more rapid assessment of vaccines proposed for licensure will be in place.
o A reliable supply of all recommended vaccines and a capability to respond to emergencies and
emergent threats to public health will be achieved and sustained.
o Information on the costs and benefits of the National Vaccine Plan will be made available on an
ongoing basis to the American people.

I.
THE PROMISE OF VACCINES
Vaccines are widely recognized as one of the most cost-effective health-promoting interventions.
Through their use in immunization programs, they hold enormous potential for controlling the incidence of
infectious diseases and thus the costs of medical care. For most diseases, treatment, hospitalization, or coping
with the effects of disability are more costly than vaccination programs. When worldwide eradication of a
disease is feasible, as has been achieved for smallpox and could soon occur for poliomyelitis, the cost savings
become even greater because immunization is no longer necessary after eradication.
Recently, the World Bank in its "World Development Report: 1993, Investing in Health," reaffirmed
that immunization is first among the public health initiatives that governments around the world should use to
save lives and avert disease and disability (World Bank, 1993). Yet the potential of vaccines to avert suffering
and death remains underexploited both globally and domestically. Infectious diseases remain the leading cause
of death worldwide (World Health Organization, 1992). In the United States, health care providers often do not
assign appropriate priority to disease prevention and miss opportunities to vaccinate. On the other hand, many
individuals fail to seek vaccination because the demand for preventive health services is traditionally not as
strong as the desire for medical treatment. New or improved vaccines are needed against literally dozens of
major diseases, and the biotechnology revolution has made many of these vaccines feasible. But the United
States and most other countries remain essentially reliant on a very small number of vaccine companies for their
present and future vaccine supply. For complex reasons the pace of vaccine innovation and improvement is
slower than public health experts believe is desirable, and the benefits of new vaccines in developing countries
are often delayed.
Notwithstanding these concerns, there are indeed many notable achievements in vaccine development
and immunization, as outlined in sections VI and VII. However, there has existed for some time the belief that
even more could be accomplished if ways could be found to bring greater cohesion to the individual activities of
those participating in these efforts. The promise of vaccines, coupled with the challenges their development and
use pose, motivated Congress to create the National Vaccine Program as a vehicle for coordination and
intervention to meet public health needs. That legislation (P.L. 99-660) called for the development of a National
Vaccine Plan that would be updated annually (see appendix 1).

II. THE MISSION OF THE NATIONAL VACCINE
PROGRAM AND PURPOSE
OF THE NATIONAL VACCINE PLAN
Infectious diseases that are preventable through the use of vaccines are still a major cause of death,
disease, and disability in the United States and worldwide, and their treatment entails substantial medical costs.
Accordingly, Congress has declared that the mission of the National Vaccine Program is to "achieve optimal
prevention of human infectious diseases through immunization and to achieve optimal prevention of adverse
reactions to vaccines" (P.L. 99-660).
The National Vaccine Program is a multifaceted, cross-departmental endeavor encompassing numerous
activities related to vaccine development and immunization. These activities are implemented by various Federal
departments and agencies acting in concert with each other, the States, and the private sector. The departments
and agencies specifically covered by the statute creating the program (or which have assumed responsibilities in
it) include the U.S. Agency for International Development; the Department of Defense; and the Department of
Health and Human Services, including the Health Care Financing Administration and various agencies of the
Public Health Service (PHS), namely, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the Health Resources and Services Administration,
and the National Institutes of Health (see appendix 2). Other Federal departments whose mandates address
health and welfare but not specifically immunization are also involved in the effort and include the Department
of Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Agriculture. The
PHS's National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) monitors, coordinates, and provides leadership for the overall
collaborative effort. In addition, the NVPO attempts to ensure that no gaps occur in Federal planning.
The National Vaccine Plan provides a strategic framework — including goals, objectives, and
strategies - for pursuing the prevention of infectious diseases. The purpose of the framework is to enable
Federal agencies, States, municipalities, and private-sector entities to undertake their individual activities in a
more coordinated fashion. The framework also will provide a basis for incorporating various other specific
efforts, such as the President's Childhood Immunization Initiative, which is aimed at establishing an effective and
sustainable vaccination delivery system for young children.
Some of the plan's goals, objectives, and strategies, as laid out in this document, are necessarily long-
term ones because successful vaccine development is a lengthy process and because achieving a sustainable,
effective vaccination delivery system within the present U.S. health care environment is likely to be complex and
difficult.
This first plan, the 1994 plan, reflects the initial efforts of the National Vaccine Program Office and
agencies collaborating in the National Vaccine Program to forge a truly integrated national effort in disease
prevention through vaccine development and immunization. As subsequent plans are prepared, the NVPO
expects to be able to coordinate more closely with the private sector and to show better the contributions of
specific Federal agency activities to meeting the plan's goals.

III. DISEASE PREVENTION THROUGH VACCINE
DEVELOPMENT AND IMMUNIZATION
Prevention of infectious diseases through the development of new or improved vaccines and their use in
immunization programs is a multifaceted process, as illustrated in figure 1. Surveillance provides accurate
information on the incidence and distribution of disease, and that information informs policy makers and the
public about threats to health and thereby helps guide the setting of priorities for vaccine development and
immunization efforts. To be useful in planning, surveillance must include the capability for early detection of
new, expanding, and reemerging infections (Institute of Medicine, 1992). In the case of diseases for which no
vaccines yet exist, biomedical research must first be conducted to understand how protection might be
accomplished. Vaccine candidates are then developed, usually by vaccine companies, through applied research,
including process development and scale up, with subsequent testing for safety and protective efficacy. The next
step is licensing, with prospective manufacturers seeking licenses for effective vaccines if they believe there is a
commercially viable market for such products.1
Immunization efforts proceed once the supply of a licensed vaccine is ensured. Immunization entails a
number of steps, including vaccine purchase or procurement, distribution, and administration by providers to the
target recipients. The effectiveness of such immunization efforts can be measured by determining "vaccination
coverage" (the proportion of the target population that is properly vaccinated) ~ which is dependent on the health
care infrastructure, access to and cost of vaccination services, and acceptance by health care providers and the
public -- and ultimately the reduced occurrence of the disease is detected through surveillance.
The vaccine development and immunization process necessarily involves many active participants,
including vaccine recipients (and for children, their surrogate decision makers); health care providers and payers;
vaccine companies; Federal, State, and local government agencies; and international organizations. The roles of
these contributors to the process are summarized in figure 2.
The actual rate of progress made in disease prevention through vaccine development and immunization
is governed by four main factors. These factors are:
o the "demand" for control of the disease, that is, the perceived public health threat and the expected
benefits of control;
o the scientific feasibility of making the desired vaccine and the demonstration of its safety and
effectiveness;
o the perceived existence of a commercially viable market for the vaccine, which determines whether
a potential producer will develop, seek licensure for, and manufacture the needed product; and
o a commitment to the effective use of the vaccine by public health and political decision makers, as
well as provision of the human and financial resources necessary to achieve effective use.
'In the United States, nearly all vaccines are made by commercial vaccine companies. In addition, two
States, Massachusetts and Michigan, hold vaccine licenses and have a limited-volume production capacity.
5


## p. 6 (#18) ###############################################

It should be noted that once promising vaccine candidates have been identified, the main constraint on
the rate of progress, if the other factors are favorable, is the availability of resources — either public or private ~
to expedite development. Furthermore, although the provision of resources for basic research cannot guarantee
success in identifying feasible approaches to vaccines, delays in vaccine development - and ultimately in disease
control - are certain to occur if the available resources are inadequate for following up on promising scientific
opportunities or for promoting immunization.
ACCELERATING VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND DISEASE PREVENTION
In the early 1980's, senior officials at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
recognized that emerging technologies in molecular biology and immunology were about to open up almost
unlimited opportunities for developing vaccines (see section VI). To prepare for using resources in the most
productive way possible, they commissioned a study by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of
Sciences to suggest ways of setting priorities for the accelerated development of vaccines, based on public health
needs and scientific opportunity. The Institute identified the possibility of accelerating, in the ensuing decade,
the development of vaccines for 14 of 35 diseases of importance in the United States and 19 of over 100
diseases of importance in developing countries. (The U.S. Agency for International Development joined NIAID
in supporting the international phase of the study). The Institute also suggested certain priorities for vaccine
development (Institute of Medicine, 1985a; 1986).
Progress has been made on many of the priority candidates (see National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, 1993a). For example, vaccines have been licensed recently for hepatitis B (recombinant
vaccine), Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis, typhoid, and Japanese encephalitis; licensing has been
requested for varicella (chicken pox) and hepatitis A vaccines. However, the overall rate of new product
licensure has been lower than expected by the Institute of Medicine. The reasons for the lower-than-expected
rate are both that the science has not evolved and that neither the Federal resources available to accelerate
vaccine development nor private-sector development activity have reached the levels necessary to match
scientific opportunities and public health needs.
ASSESSING PROGRESS TOWARD DISEASE PREVENTION
The number of human diseases caused by infectious agents is not known with certainty; new causative
agents are continually being recognized. The number of infectious agents identified worldwide as causes of
human disease probably well exceeds 200. For most of these agents, more basic research is needed to identify
approaches to their prevention through immunization. A disease may be judged "potentially vaccine preventable"
if enough is known from basic research to envision a vaccine candidate. The progress of a vaccine candidate
toward licensure can be evaluated by determining what stage it has reached in the development "pipeline" of
prelicensure activities. Where a vaccine is licensed, the extent to which it reaches the population for which it is
recommended is a rough guide to its impact on the incidence of disease.
As of January 1994, vaccines have been licensed in the United States for 22 diseases (figure 3, section
A), and roughly twice that number of diseases are now judged to be potentially vaccine preventable (figure 3,
section B). Nevertheless, of the vaccines licensed in the United States, none fully reach the populations for
which they are recommended, and many need to be improved so that they are more effective and result in fewer
adverse effects.

Although figure 3 provides a useful summary of the current status of vaccine development and
immunization in the United States, it also masks the substantial research efforts that are under way to improve on
or combine vaccines already licensed. These efforts target measles vaccines for use under 9 months of age;
pneumococcal vaccines for use under 12 months of age; new cholera and typhoid vaccines; heat-stable
poliomyelitis vaccines; timed-release "micro-encapsulated" tetanus toxoid vaccines; and improved meningococcal
and pertussis vaccines. In addition, various combination vaccines currently are undergoing testing. Many of the
improvements likely to result from these efforts not only will improve the level of public health in the United
States but also will be of particular importance for disease control in less developed countries. Some of these
improvements, and the new vaccines, will be possible only with the better understanding that derives from basic
research. Accordingly, in accelerating the development of new or improved vaccines, the earlier that resources
can be provided, the sooner the public health benefits from immunization will begin to accrue.

IV. THE GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND STRATEGIES
OF THE NATIONAL VACCINE PLAN
The core of the National Vaccine Plan consists of a set of goals, objectives, and strategies aimed
primarily at reducing the incidence of infectious diseases through vaccine development and immunization. These
planning elements have been developed by the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) in response to the
congressional requirements set forth in title XXI of the Public Health Service Act as amended by P.L. 99-660
(see appendix 1), and taking into account the current vaccine- and immunization-related activities of both the
public and private sectors. The plan is intended to integrate all U.S. efforts on vaccine development and
immunization, irrespective of whether their short-term focus is domestic or global.
The four goals of the National Vaccine Plan are:
Goal 1: Develop new and improved vaccines.
Goal 2: Ensure the optimal safety and effectiveness of vaccines and immunization.
Goal 3: Better educate the public and members of the health professions on the benefits and risks of
immunizations.
Goal 4: Achieve better use of existing vaccines to prevent disease, disability, and death.
For each of the four goals, the NVPO has identified a set of related objectives and the strategies through
which these objectives will be pursued. The ordering of goals, objectives, and strategies in this plan corresponds
with the mandate of P.L. 99-660 and does not indicate a ranking or imply a chronological sequence. The goals,
objectives, and strategies will be pursued in parallel, taking into account interrelationships where they are
pertinent. For example, the strategies for goal 3 are designed to elicit the fullest possible participation by health
care providers in pursuing goal 4, in that they are a critical interface in vaccination programs between health
agencies and the public.
Strategies may be implemented through a number of activities that in turn may be undertaken under the
authority of different government agencies. Various activities under each strategy may be pursued on different
schedules. Activities will be based on needs and opportunities. For example, the Childhood Immunization
Initiative will capitalize on what can be done immediately to prevent diseases through the use of existing
vaccines (see appendix 9).
Because more than 70 basic strategies have been developed and each one is likely to entail several
activities, this document does not include details on the activities.
Following is a list of the strategies for each of the objectives for the plan's four goals.

V.
MICROBIAL THREATS TO HEALTH
AND GLOBAL COLLABORATION
AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES
THE GLOBAL THREAT OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Infectious diseases do not respect political boundaries and are usually not contained geographically.
Hence, control of infectious diseases has traditionally elicited collaboration among governments, public health
officials, and researchers. Increasingly, travel, human migration and commerce have contributed to the
movement of infectious agents from one region of the world to another. Such introductions are often transient
but they can become established with severe consequences. Historically, smallpox devastated indigenous
populations in the Americas when introduced from Europe and syphilis spread through Europe after its
introduction by sailors returning from the New World. Nowadays, even the pandemic spread of infections that
require intimate contact, such as HIV/AIDS, can become global pandemics in a few years. The present-day
interconnectedness of the global "germ pool" is well illustrated by the speed with which the worldwide
dissemination of new influenza strains takes place each year. The spread of penicillin-resistant strains of
gonorrhea from Southeast Asia to other parts of the world is well documented. Even when some degree of
control is achieved over a disease in the United States, as with malaria, measles, and poliomyelitis, there remains
the threat to Americans of exposure by importation or travel. Inadequate vaccination or otherwise inadequate
prevention efforts are often discovered through such infections.
Thus, the occurrence of an infectious disease somewhere in the world threatens, to some degree, all
other parts of the world. Similarly, within countries, complacency about disproportionate disease incidence in
population subgroups (usually those already otherwise disadvantaged) is not only inappropriate in terms of equity
but also unsound public health policy. Infections, such as tuberculosis, in any part of a society threaten the rest
of that society. This means that it is in the direct interest of the United States to support the control of infectious
diseases, to the maximum extent possible, not only at home but also worldwide and not only to protect U.S.
travelers and military personnel, but also to decrease the risk of disease importation.
OLD AND EMERGING MICROBIAL THREATS TO HUMAN HEALTH
With the discovery of antibiotics and their effectiveness in treating some bacterial diseases, the
perception may have arisen in industrialized countries in the two or three decades following World War II that
infectious diseases generally posed a decreasing threat to human health. However, experience in both developing
and industrialized countries shows such a view to be inaccurate. Even as some diseases have been brought under
a reasonable degree of control in certain regions, infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide
(World Health Organization, 1992).
Careful observation and analysis show that microbial threats to health will undoubtedly continue because
(with some exceptions) mankind is unlikely to make major inroads against the preponderance of infectious
diseases in the next decade or so. It is entirely possible that microbial threats may intensify. In an analysis of
new microbial threats, namely, those whose incidence has increased in the last two decades, the Institute of
Medicine recently reported on over 50 emerging infections that threaten the United States (Institute of Medicine,
1992). Worldwide the total is probably many times greater. Emerging infections include those attributable to
the introduction into the human population of a new agent (for example, as is probable with HIV), those
attributable to the recognition of an infectious agent as the cause of a known disease (for example, Helicobacter
pylori, the probable cause of gastric and peptic ulcers), and those attributable to changes in or interactions among
21


## p. 22 (#34) ##############################################

the microorganism, the human host, and the environment, resulting in spread or greater virulence. In some cases,
emergence is more strictly "reemergence" of a known disease after a stabilization or decline of its incidence:
such is the case for cholera in Latin America; tuberculosis, much of which is now multi-drug-resistant; for
antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal pneumonia; and for group A streptococcal disease (which killed puppeteer Jim
Henson).
Emerging microbial threats arise because of a number of factors operating singly or in combination:
o changes in human population density and distribution;
o changes in society or human social behavior;
o changes brought about by technology and industry;
o changes resulting from economic development and land use;
o microbial adaption and change; and
o breakdown of public health measures.
Vigilance against emerging infections is a critical component of the Nation's overall effort to combat
infectious diseases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1994; excerpts from this document are included
here in appendix 4).
GLOBAL COLLABORATION AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES: U.S. PARTICIPATION
There are several reasons in addition to those mentioned above why the United States has historically
been a major force for global collaboration to control infectious diseases:
o International collaboration has proved successful in combating infectious diseases, as evidenced by
the worldwide campaigns to eradicate smallpox and poliomyelitis.
o It has been demonstrated that significant cost savings in health care can be achieved when a disease
is globally eradicated because there is no longer a need to immunize people against the causative
agent (see section XI).
o Many studies have shown that the control of infectious diseases can help promote economic
development abroad, which is an important foreign policy goal of the U.S. government (see, for
example, World Bank, 1993).
o With the increasing globalization of medical research, many breakthroughs in infectious disease
control are possible only through collaborative international research, often involving institutions in
both industrialized and developing countries.
o There is growing international awareness of the humanitarian obligations of industrialized countries
to share the benefits of medical research with poorer countries without delay.
22


## p. 23 (#35) ##############################################

o Because drug-resistant organisms, such as those causing gonorrhea, pneumonia, tuberculosis,
typhoid, dysentery (shigella), and malaria (Plasmodium spp.) spread rapidly, there is a need for
coordinated action on an international scale to provide worldwide protection against them.
International collaborations to apply existing vaccines -- such as the World Health Organization's
Expanded Programme on Immunization -- have met with great success (see section VII). But comprehensive
infectious disease control involves more than just more efficient delivery of currently available vaccines; new and
improved vaccines must be developed and made available at affordable costs to immunization programs in
developing countries. Traditionally, most vaccines have been developed for use in the industrialized world in the
private sector and then have been introduced, as costs have fallen, in less developed countries. As a result,
vaccines have not yet been successfully developed against some of the major causes of death in less developed
countries (such as malaria); for other vaccines currently in use in the United States, the epidemiological
appropriateness and applicability for their use in developing countries remain in question. Even when vaccines
are of proven value, such as that for hepatitis B, the cost remains prohibitive for many years for a large segment
of the world's population for which it would be highly beneficial.
Action has been taken to address these concerns. The U.S. Government has directly supported
international research efforts in vaccine development through its support for the Special Programme for Research
and Training in Tropical Diseases, a collaborative undertaking of the United Nations Development Programme,
the World Bank, and the World Health Organization, and more recently for the Children's Vaccine Initiative (see
section VI). In addition, the United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development and the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has directly supported epidemiological studies, vaccine field
trials, and cost-effectiveness studies at many sites, including the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease
Research in Bangladesh (ICDDR.B), the Medical Research Council in Gambia, and the Institute for Medical
Research in Papua, New Guinea.
Just as basic vaccine research on infectious diseases conducted in the United States will ultimately
benefit the global community, international activities supported by the U.S. Government will ultimately result in
a lower risk of diseases entering the United States and in reduced risk for U.S. travelers and military personnel
overseas. For this reason, Congress has called upon the National Vaccine Program (through P.L. 99-660) to
conduct activities that would "fulfill commitments of the United States to prevent human infectious diseases in
other countries." The National Vaccine Plan therefore integrates international activities under the relevant
thematic goals and objectives.

VI.
THE STATUS OF VACCINE
DEVELOPMENT ~ 1993
Although the principle of preventing infectious diseases through the use of vaccines was established
experimentally in the 18th century, most of the vaccines currently in use have been created since the 1930's (see
figure 4). Today, over 20 major human diseases caused by bacteria or viruses can be prevented by the use of
vaccines. In the United States, vaccines for such diseases as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough),
measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), and poliomyelitis have been available and widely used in children
for many years. Recently, new vaccines, such as those for hepatitis B virus and Haemophilus influenzae type b
(Hib), have been developed, licensed, and recommended for universal use in children.
In addition, other licensed vaccines, such as those for influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia, are used
in populations at special risk (some of which, such as the elderly, are numerically quite large). Licensed
vaccines for other special uses, such as the military or travelers, include those for adenovirus, plague, rabies,
yellow fever, salmonella, and Japanese encephalitis. (See appendix 5 for a list of vaccines licensed in the United
States).
NEW METHODS AVAILABLE FOR MAKING VACCINES
Translation of basic biomedical research into a licensed product has historically been a slow, sometimes
uncertain, and costly process. Currently, it takes more than a decade to develop a successful vaccine (Institute of
Medicine, 1993b). As with drug development, few of the candidates that enter the early stages of animal or
clinical testing emerge as effective vaccines suitable for licensure.
The biotechnology revolution has significantly expanded our capability to develop vaccines. Since 1980
a range of new methods has been added to the traditional approaches of using inactivated or attenuated pathogens
as vaccines. Such new methods widen the range of approaches that can be tested, and could lead to many more
vaccine candidates being in the development pipeline during the next decade. Most investigators believe that
these new methods offer the prospect of vaccines that are freer from adverse reactions. The new methods
include:
o conjugation of polysaccharides antigens to proteins, thereby enhancing their immunogenicity;
o protein synthesis using recombinant DNA techniques;
o use of synthetic peptide immunogens;
o attenuation, using genetic engineering;
o use of vaccine vectors, such as attenuated viral and bacterial vaccine strains such as poxviruses,
adenovirus, salmonella, or Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), that can be genetically engineered to
facilitate the presentation of immunogens; and
o immunization with naked DNA.
In addition to these methods that can be used to make vaccine candidates, new or dramatically improved
tools in biochemistry and immunology have also emerged in the last decade or so. Such advances include

techniques for more rapidly sequencing or synthesizing peptides, proteins, and genetic material (RNA and DNA);
and refinements in x-ray crystallography for showing protein structure, and thus the portions of pathogen surfaces
that present to the human immune system. In addition, new methods have been developed for manipulating
cellular systems, for example, to synthesize selected molecules in quantity; for presenting antigens to the immune
system in novel ways, for example, by using carriers such as iscoms (immunostimulatory complexes) or by using
timed-release capsules; and for enhancing the immunogenicity of antigens, with new adjuvants. Finally, the
scientific understanding of the human immune system has been deepened, in part as a result of the research
stimulus provided by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Consequently, the opportunity exists, if all these techniques are
applied energetically on a broad front, for there to be an unprecedented wave of vaccine development.
THE NEED FOR IMPROVED AND COMBINATION VACCINES
To attain optimal immunity and protection from an infectious disease, full vaccination needs to be
achieved before the recipient is exposed to the disease-causing agent. For many diseases, this requirement means
that vaccination must occur in infancy. However, some currently available vaccines cannot be usefully
administered early enough in life to provide complete protection. Furthermore, most require multiple doses for
full effect and some are not as free from side effects as is desirable. Hence, there is a need to develop improved
vaccines for certain diseases.
It is highly desirable that each child be fully immunized in as few contacts as possible with the health
care delivery system and that the child receive the minimum number of injections on a single visit (multiple
injections are safe but may distress vaccine recipients or their parents). Some existing vaccines are already
administered in combination - for example, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (DTP) and measles-mumps-
rubella vaccine (MMR). However, further combinations of existing and new vaccines are necessary. The need
to improve immunization delivery through the development of such desirable vaccines is a major feature of the
recently launched, internationally supported Children's Vaccine Initiative.
THE CHILDREN'S VACCINE INITIATIVE
The potential to eradicate certain diseases such as poliomyelitis and to build sustainable immunization
programs that reach every child may not be realized with existing vaccines. Vaccines are required that will
improve access to services by simplifying the immunization schedule. Therefore the United States is a cosponsor
of the worldwide Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI), which is intended to facilitate the transition from existing
to new vaccines by promoting directed vaccine research, catalyzing improvement in the quality of vaccines
produced in developing countries, and strengthening supply and delivery systems. The CVI is sponsored by the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the
Rockefeller Foundation, the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO).
The CVI has outlined the ultimate objective of its quest: a vaccine (or combination of vaccines) that is
safe, heat stable (that is, does not require refrigeration), can be administered orally early in life, and produces
life-long protection against a number of diseases with only one or a few doses, and that is affordable. Such
"tools" would facilitate U.S. immunization efforts as well as those in developing countries. Although developing
a single vaccine that meets these ambitious specifications may take several decades, the United States, as one
part of its contribution to the CVI, has already made rapid progress in the development of new combinations of
current vaccines — for example, DTP and Hib-conjugate ~ to help make immunization more efficient within the
next few years. Work is currently in progress in the United States on other combinations, such as DTP-polio,
DTP-hepatitis B, MMR-varicella (chicken pox). The CVI has recently launched a major fundraising effort to
support implementation of its recently developed strategic plan.

THE NEED AND PROSPECTS FOR NEW AND IMPROVED VACCINES
Many infectious diseases are still major causes of death, disease, and disability in the United Stales and
worldwide. The reemergence of familiar diseases once thought controlled, such as tuberculosis and malaria, and
the emergence of new diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and Lyme disease, show that infectious diseases will continue
to threaten the public health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1993; excerpts from this document are
included here in appendix 4). These diseases already result in great suffering and significant health care costs.
Thus the need for new and improved vaccines is clear. Therefore research directed toward developing new and
improved vaccines is being supported by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID), States with vaccine production facilities, and vaccine
companies.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) reports annually on progress being
made toward new and improved vaccines for more than 50 disease-causing agents, as well as on other aspects of
vaccinology, such as adjuvant development, clinical trials methodology, and combination vaccines. As reported
in "The Jordan Report: Accelerated Development of Vaccines -- 1993," more than 150 new or improved vaccine
candidates are in various stages of basic research, animal testing, or human testing. For 25 diseases, vaccine
candidates (sometimes more than one) have reached clinical trials (see figure 3). In recent years, the Public
Health Service has been particularly active in the evaluation of new pertussis vaccine candidates. In addition, the
urgent need for a vaccine to help in controlling the rapidly growing AIDS pandemic has been actively addressed
by NIH, in particular the NIAID Division of AIDS, and the Department of Defense. A wide range of
approaches to a vaccine to prevent HIV infection are being pursued through basic research, animal testing or
phase I and II clinical trials. Preparation of sites for phase III trials is underway.
As of December 1993, Product License Applications had been submitted to the Food Drug
Administration (FDA) for vaccines against hepatitis A and varicella. Vaccines in phase III clinical trials (for
efficacy) include those for rotavirus diarrhea, pertussis (improved), cholera (improved), pneumonococcal otitis
media, typhoid (improved), leprosy, malaria, leishmaniasis, and various viral encephalitic fevers, representing
potential candidates for licensure if efficacious and safe.
In March 1993, NIAID convened a panel of experts to advise it on long-term goals for vaccine research
and recommend priorities for the use of anticipated additional resources for FY 1993 and FY 1994. The
conclusions of that group, outlined in the report "NIAID Blue Ribbon Panel on Vaccine Research: Summary"
(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 1993), will guide NIAID in executing its responsibilities
under the overall strategic plan described in this document (the summary is reproduced here in appendix 6).
NIAID is in the process of preparing "critical path" development plans for all major (non-HIV/AIDS) vaccine
candidates. Research priorities and development strategies for HIV/AIDS vaccines are contained in the "NIAID
HIV/AIDS Research Agenda" (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 1993c).
USAID reports annually on its vaccine development and immunization activities in "Child Survival:
Report to Congress on the USAID Program." With regard to international vaccine research and development
priorities, the CVI Task Force on Strategic Planning identified 12 infectious agents for which new and improved
vaccines would address a large disease burden and could be available in the next 5 years. Although some of
these also represent NIAID priorities, others (such as a heat-stable polio vaccine or specific formulations of
pneumococcal vaccines) would be used mostly outside the United States. The CVI is attempting to catalyze
research, development, and testing of these vaccines.
CHANGING PRIVATE-SECTOR INVOLVEMENT IN VACCINE INNOVATION
Apart from some limited-volume manufacturing capacity in State facilities (Massachusetts and
Michigan) and the pilot lot facilities of the Department of Defense, the United States is reliant upon private-
sector production for its vaccine supply, whether for widely used vaccines or for those used in particular
28


## p. 29 (#41) ##############################################

populations such as the military. Further, it is important to recognize that industry has historically been the
critical player in ensuring that a vaccine becomes available. Typically, one of the large vaccine companies has
undertaken pilot manufacturing, efficacy testing, and application for product licensure. Consequently, the private
sector plays a key role in vaccine innovation and supply in the United States and hence in the well-being of the
American public.
Over the past two decades, there have been several significant shifts in factors that have a major bearing
on the private sector's engagement in vaccine development. For example, in 1972, responsibility for the
regulation of biologics, including vaccines, was moved from the National Institutes of Health to the FDA.
During the mid-1970's, the FDA established new procedures for the review of safety and efficacy data on
vaccine products for which licensure was desired. These changes placed greater demands on vaccine companies
that wanted to get new products licensed or to maintain licenses for products approved for marketing before
1972.
In the second half of the 1970's, there was increasing concern over liability for alleged vaccine-related
adverse events owing to the outcomes of a small number of jury trials and industry experience with claims
(Institute of Medicine, 1986). In 1976, anticipation of a virulent epidemic of influenza, liability concerns, and
the emergency timetable necessary for vaccine production led to unique Federal legislation - creation of the
National Influenza Immunization Program, also known as the Swine 'Flu Program - to provide protection for
industry in the case of the "swine 'flu" vaccine. However, the fact that the epidemic did not materialize, that the
vaccine had side effects, and that some felt that industry had been bailed out at taxpayer expense cast a shadow
over subsequent discussions of immunization, vaccine liability, and pricing. In 1977, the Assistant Secretary of
Health appointed the National Immunization Work Groups to study vaccine development and vaccination efforts.
However, their recommendations (National Immunization Work Groups, 1977) were not implemented for a
variety of reasons, including a change in administration. Public concern over vaccine safety, liability, and
compensation, particularly for pertussis vaccine, increased with the airing in 1982 of a television documentary
entitled "DTP: Vaccine Roulette" (WRC-TV, 1982) and the 1985 publication of "DTP: A Shot in the Dark"
(Coulter and Fisher, 1985).
The combination of these factors and others, such as the need to replace aging production facilities, led
to examination by pharmaceutical companies of the attractiveness of involvement in vaccine development and
manufacturing. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, vaccine production came to be concentrated in a handful of
companies. For some vaccines, the country became ~ and has continued to be - dependent on a single
manufacturer. Supply interruptions, arising from production problems, in the early 1980's led to the creation of a
Federal vaccine stockpile that has reduced but not eliminated concerns about the security of the national vaccine
supply.
After studying the problems outlined above, the Institute of Medicine issued the report "Vaccine Supply
and Innovation." This report proposed mechanisms to achieve a more coordinated national approach to vaccine
development and identified options for alleviating liability and compensation concerns related to alleged vaccine-
related injury (Institute of Medicine, 1985). Through P.L. 99-660, Congress created the National Vaccine
Program (NVP) in 1986 as a vehicle for coordinating Federal efforts in vaccine development and immunization.
The law also established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), as an alternative to the
tort system for those seeking compensation for alleged vaccine injury. These measures were designed to
facilitate collaboration between the public and private sectors (by improving coordination and making Federal
planning more explicit) and to remove the disincentives that uncertainty over liability posed for manufacturers.
Although there has been a delay in development of the National Vaccine Plan, coordination between Federal
agencies has been improved by the NVP Interagency Group and the Interagency Committee on Immunization
(see section X). The NVICP seems to have greatly diminished the disincentive to vaccine companies arising
from uncertainty over vaccine liability and compensation. Other factors have also made involvement in vaccine
research development and manufacturing more commercially attractive in the 1990's than it was in the early
29


## p. 30 (#42) ##############################################

1980's. Vaccine pricing is more favorable to industry, providing higher revenues from which to support research
on future products, and there are more scientific opportunities to pursue.
The Institute of Medicine (1993b) and Sisk (1993) have noted that there seems to be greater activity by
the private sector in vaccine research and development in the early 1990's, as compared to the late 1970's and
early 1980's. In addition, Mowery and Mitchell (1993) have noted considerable activity in the last few years in
acquisitions, joint ventures, and licensing agreements among companies undertaking vaccine development,
suggesting that the private sector is reacquiring a significant interest in the commercial potential of vaccines.
A portion of the apparent increase in private-sector vaccine research and early development is being
conducted by smaller, recently founded biotechnology companies. The increasing involvement of such
companies in early product development, which predates the creation of the NVICP (Sisk, 1993), is probably
attributable, at least in part, to the existence of scientific opportunities and the availability of venture capital to
fund exploratory endeavors in the field.
Thus, private-sector involvement in vaccine development superficially appears to be much healthier now
than it was in the late 1970's and early 1980's. However there are some compelling reasons for carefully
examining vaccine development prospects and long-term policy setting:
o Much of the present private-sector activity, particularly that of smaller biotechnology companies, is
in early vaccine research and development, which is less demanding of human and financial
resources than efficacy trials.
o Many smaller biotechnology companies do not have the resources or experience for pilot
manufacturing of candidate vaccines to standards required by the FDA for efficacy trials or for the
conduct of the trials themselves.
o There is a possibility that investors in newly founded biotechnology companies are looking for a
return on investment more from an increase in company value than from an increase in revenue
from products, and are thus not necessarily committed to long-term vaccine development through
licensure.
o There is a possibility that those companies with more experience in the final stages of vaccine
development and marketing may not be interested in taking through to licensure those vaccine
candidates with which they have little technical experience and in which they have limited
proprietary claims.
These concerns raise questions as to whether smaller biotechnology companies can consistently obtain
sufficient capital and routinely guide prototype products through full testing and licensure, as do the larger
vaccine companies, and whether the current level of biotechnology company activity will be sustained if
profitable products are not rapidly forthcoming and investors look elsewhere for more attractive opportunities.
The only experience to date on the potential of smaller biotechnology companies to contribute to vaccine
availability is with glycoconjugate vaccines for Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), in which a small company
did successfully develop and license a product; the company was Praxis, which was later acquired by Lederle.
There are additional points to consider that are not specifically related to the involvement of smaller
biotechnology companies:
o The reduced uncertainty on injury liability provided by the NVICP pertains only to routinely used
childhood vaccines; hence, vaccine companies are still apprehensive over liability concerns for
other vaccines.
30


## p. 31 (#43) ##############################################

o Consideration of HIV vaccine development has further renewed concerns over liability and
compensation for vaccine injury, including the possible consequences of stigma or discrimination
associated with seropositivity. (Two states ~ California and Connecticut - have passed liability
legislation to encourage commercial involvement in HIV vaccine development).
o Other possibilities in HTV vaccine development -- such as the need for behavioral counseling in
trials, early testing in women and children, overseas trials, and testing of live, attenuated approaches
- have highlighted other complicated ethical, legal, and scientific questions, in some cases pertinent
to testing vaccines for other diseases, that may influence commercial involvement.
o Changing arrangements for Federal vaccine purchases, and the evolution of health care reform in
general, are likely to contribute in some degree to a reexamination of long-term commercial
investment decisions, such as those for product development.
o Consumer pressure for vaccine combinations may further generate research, manufacturing, or
marketing alliances.
o The number of U.S.-based vaccine companies with sufficient in-house resources for taking vaccine
candidates through the process of product development, licensure, and marketing is still very small.
o Many vaccine companies based outside the United States cite U.S. licensure requirements and the
liability environment as major factors in decisions regarding entry into the U.S. market, although
acquiring FDA approval for a product is widely viewed as an asset internationally, and some major
companies have started to market vaccines in the United States in the last few years.
o Historically, vaccines whose major use would be in developing countries are not regarded by
vaccine companies in industrialized countries as attractive or even justifiable development
investments; however, many economists believe that the growing economic strength of transitional
developing countries in Asia and Latin America, and the numerically large affluent classes in some
very large developing countries, offer potentially large markets for certain vaccines or opportunities
for joint ventures, as in product finishing.
On the international side, a systematic survey of vaccine supply systems by WHO's Expanded
Programme on Immunization and the CVI revealed that less than 50 percent of the vaccines used in developing
countries were actually supplied by private-sector producers through the UNICEF procurement mechanism. The
proportion estimated to be manufactured in the country of use, mostly by public-sector manufacturers, was
highest for DTP (60 percent), which entails relatively old production technology.
Because of the extent of local manufacturing, international attention and U.S. assistance have been
increasingly focused on helping to ensure the quality of locally produced vaccines through provision of technical
assistance by quality-control experts or through strengthening regulatory capability in developing countries and
elsewhere. USAID is currently working with U.S. vaccine companies, the FDA, and Russian vaccine
manufacturers to improve the quality of local produced vaccines. In other countries, USAID and oUier donors
are working to catalyze government steps to allow greater autonomy or even privatization of public-sector
vaccine producers.
Given the changing environment in which vaccine companies make decisions, as well as the specific
concerns cited above, it is evident that it is necessary to continuously monitor private-sector involvement in, and
attitudes toward, vaccine development. There may be situations in which public health priorities and commercial
interest do not coincide, with consequent delays in or the complete absence of development of priority vaccines.
There could be many more vaccine candidates requiring efficacy testing in the coming decade than there have
been historically, and special efforts may be needed to accommodate such testing. Some candidates of low
31

commercial interest or from small companies may need special attention to ensure that testing occurs without
delay. Policies that affect, or are intended to substitute for, private-sector involvement in ensuring vaccine
development and supply should be based on thorough analysis and consultation. The National Vaccine Program
Office now plans increased consultations with industry as originally envisioned under P.L. 99-660. Such
consultation with the private sector is a priority for FY 1994 and FY 1995 to strengthen future iterations of the
National Vaccine Plan (see section IX).

VII. THE STATUS OF IMMUNIZATION - 1993
Globally, immunization has been a great public health success story in recent decades. In the 1960's
and 1970's the scourge of smallpox was eradicated worldwide by major vaccination efforts led by the World
Health Organization (WHO), which received substantial support from the United States. In the last 15 years,
WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunization, supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) and many others, has catalyzed dramatic increases in childhood vaccination levels, in most countries to
the 80 percent level (see figure 5). WHO estimates that 3.2 million child deaths are prevented annually by these
immunization programs against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, measles, and tuberculosis. In the last
5 years, major progress has been made toward eradicating polio, particularly in the Americas (figure 6). The last
indigenous case in the Western Hemisphere was reported in Peru in 1991, but the region remains under threat of
importation of polio from elsewhere in the world (Robbins, 1993; Foege, 1993).
Despite these successes, millions of child deaths caused by potentially vaccine preventable diseases still
occur in developing countries each year. Immunization programs in many countries have serious deficiencies,
ranging from erratic vaccine supplies, attributable to financing, procurement, and/or production problems, to poor
epidemiological surveillance systems to indicate where disease outbreaks occur, to inadequate vaccine handling
and "cold chain" systems, to poor service delivery. Many of the larger developing countries are able to produce
some of the vaccines they need, but a major international effort continues to be required to ensure that the
quality and supply of those vaccines are adequate.
All aspects of the vaccine production and immunization delivery system in developing countries are
further stressed by the ambitious regional and global disease control targets. As a result, a major challenge is
simply to sustain the high global vaccination coverage levels, and to put immunization programs on a sustainable
footing, especially in parts of Africa and Asia. USAID has devoted a considerable portion of its child survival
resources to strengthening immunization programs in developing countries.
CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES
Over the last three decades, the United States has succeeded in using immunization to drastically reduce
morbidity and mortality associated with many infectious diseases, as shown in table 1. Successively the
incidence of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, and rubella has been significantly controlled as
vaccines for these diseases have become widely used (see appendix 7). Consequently, diphtheria, paralytic polio,
and tetanus are virtually eliminated and measles, mumps, rubella, and pertussis are greatly reduced.
All 50 States now have school-entry vaccination requirements, and most of them require vaccination for
attendance at preschool or day care centers. As a result, over 95 percent of American children are protected
against seven childhood diseases by the time they enter school. (However, vaccine may not have been
administered according to the optimal schedule for protection early in life). Coverage with more recently
introduced vaccines -- for hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis -- is much lower but
increasing, with significant effects on disease incidence as shown for the latter in figure 7. A decline in
meningitis incidence has corresponded with increasing use of conjugate Hib vaccine, since 1988. Reduction in
the long-term sequelae of hepatitis B infection (cirrhosis and liver cancer) will not be evident for 20 years or
more because of the long delay before their occurrence.

The most dramatic declines in disease incidence achieved through the use of vaccines occurred during
the 1960's and 1970's. During the 1980's, there was difficulty in maintaining immunization efforts. In recent
years, various barriers have arisen that make it difficult for the United States to realize its goal of achieving full
benefits from existing vaccines (Freeman, Johnson, and Babcock, 1993). The principal barriers are:
o Decreasing parental awareness of diseases reduces the demand for immunization.
o The greatest risk of disease has shifted to preschool children, a group that is difficult to reach.
o Adding new vaccines to the immunization schedule can complicate delivery.
o Significantly more children live in poverty and at risk of underimmunization.
o Changes in vaccination schedules, such as the need for additional doses, can complicate the tasks of
parents and health care providers.
o Reducing the threat of diseases by immunization increases parental concern about adverse reactions.
o Fear of adverse reactions may deter providers from promoting immunization.
o Misunderstanding, by providers and the public, of liability protection and compensation available
under the vaccine injury law may lead to avoidance of vaccination.
o Rising costs of vaccines and vaccine administration may pose a barrier to receiving vaccinations.
o Impediments to immunization result from the fragmentation of the U.S. health care system and its
financing.
o State and local laws, policies, or practices may pose impediments to vaccination.
Weaknesses in the national vaccination system were dramatically revealed by the measles epidemics of
1989-91 (figure 8). Measles cases rose sharply in those years, which were marked by an approximately 10-fold
increase over the annual average of the prior years. During the 1989-91 period, there were more than 55,000
cases, 11,000 hospitalizations (for a total of 44,000 hospital-days), and 136 deaths. Almost one-half of the cases
occurred in unvaccinated preschool children, mostly minorities (see appendix 8). Emergency vaccination efforts
contained the epidemics, but only after they had caused considerable avoidable suffering.
In response to the measles epidemics, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) assessed the
lessons to be learned from this experience in "The Measles Epidemic: Problems, Barriers, Recommendations"
(National Vaccine Advisory Committee, 1991).

Measles, being among the most contagious of vaccine-preventable diseases, is a sensitive indicator that
signals failures in the system of vaccination. Hence, it is reasonable to suspect that substantial numbers of
children are at risk of pertussis, poliomyelitis, rubella, mumps, etc., as well as measles. NVAC concluded that
the principal cause of the measles epidemic and the main shortcoming in the vaccination system overall was
failure to provide vaccines to children on schedule, arising from:
o missed opportunities for administering vaccines, despite contacts with health care providers;
o shortfalls in the health care delivery system, resulting in specific barriers to immunization;
o inadequate access to health care;
o incomplete public awareness of, and lack of public demand for, immunization; and
o sociocultural and logistical barriers.
As a result of the recognition of these deficiencies, a number of steps have been taken.
Recommendations on ways to improve access to childhood immunizations have been made by NVAC (National
Vaccine Advisory Committee, 1992). The Interagency Committee on Immunization has prepared an "Action
Plan to Improve Access to Immunization Services," which identifies necessary Federal actions (Interagency
Committee on Immunization, 1992). Additionally, a wide range of concerned organizations have endorsed and
are promoting NVAC's "Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practices" (National Vaccine Advisory
Committee, 1993).
In parallel with the above activities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have provided
funding for States and selected municipalities to individually develop and implement Immunization Action Plans
for their jurisdictions, targeting the critical local concerns and situations.
Most recently, NVAC has competed a study of impediments at the State and local levels to children's
immunization services. It found that such services were suboptimal because of public health infrastructure
weaknesses and laid out a series of strategies with detailed recommendations to address the specific State and
local impediments identified (National Vaccine Advisory Committee, 1994a).
CHILDREN AT RISK OF UNDERIMMUNIZATION
Children living in poverty, particularly those belonging to minority populations, are at risk for under-
immunization because it is difficult for the medical establishment to reach them. Such children often are not
getting immunized on schedule because of limited financial resources, high stress levels, multigenerational family
obligations, limited transportation and other services in their local neighborhoods, their families' nonfluency in
English, discomfort with majority culture bureaucracies, and fear of inoculation. Although mainstream media
may carry campaigns designed to raise community awareness, sociocultural and logistical barriers mean that such
efforts often fail to reach or to motivate the families of these children.
It is not possible to precisely define the proportion of children in these circumstances, in that a variety
of interacting factors contribute to the risk of underimmunization. But the situation does suggest that innovative
approaches will be needed to ensure that all children are reached with vaccinations on the proper schedule.
Many children at risk of underimmunization are from families that do not have a medical "home," but
which do have ongoing contact with one or more welfare or social service programs for assistance, such as
income assistance; Head Start; social service counseling or case management; parenting education; family
preservation/family support; the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP); and the special supplemental
38


## p. 39 (#51) ##############################################

Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, housing programs, etc. Many of the children who were victims
of the 1989-1991 measles epidemics were from families that had contact with such programs.
New and innovative collaborative strategies involving the medical, welfare, and social services
communities are needed to ensure that such children do receive the full benefits of immunization, particularly
where they do not have access to routine medical care. Many welfare and social service agencies already have
contact with these children, and should be encouraged to include or expand information and education on the
need for immunization in their regular programs. For example, agencies that offer parenting education and child
abuse prevention programs could cover immunization in their regular curricula; self-sufficiency and income-
support programs such as JOBS and Aid to Families with Dependent Children could include information on
immunization in their case management and life-skills components; educational initiatives on nutrition and health,
such as those of the Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service, could include information on
immunization; and local agencies such as Community Action Agencies, Head Start programs, and public health
clinics could train and hire local residents to work as liaison workers linking the medical establishment and the
children who need to be immunized. Furthermore, doctors and public health nurses could be stationed on site at
Community Action Agencies, welfare offices, etc. to provide immunizations when families arrive for their
regular services. Initiatives have been started in many of the areas noted above and more will be stimulated in
the near future by the National Vaccine Program Office.
The proper immunization of all children is essential if the United States is to meet its immunization
targets. Even more critical is the need to get children at risk of underimmunization into the health system
through the Childhood Immunization Initiative, and to keep them there so that they can continue to receive
general preventive health care through regular health care providers.
ADULT IMMUNIZATION
Vaccines against influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, measles, mumps,
and rubella can be used to protect all adults from these diseases. Additionally, vaccines against poliomyelitis,
rabies, typhoid, yellow fever, meningococcal meningitis, and cholera are available for use in adults in special
circumstances (as are some vaccines used only in the military).
Nevertheless, too many adults in the United States continue to be struck down by vaccine-preventable
diseases. Each year, 50,000 to 70,000 adults die of influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, and hepatitis B. The
overall cost to society of these and other vaccine-preventable diseases of adults exceeds $10 billion each year,
yet adult vaccines continue to be not widely used (National Vaccine Advisory Committee, 1994b). Even though
it is estimated that 90 percent of influenza deaths occur in those over 65 years of age, vaccination coverage for
this population group is estimated at only 41 percent. For pneumococcal vaccination, the coverage is around 20
percent. Many adults remain susceptible to other vaccine-preventable diseases because they have not been
immunized earlier in life (see table 2).
The reasons for this situation include (1) limited appreciation of the importance of adult vaccine-
preventable diseases; (2) doubts about the safety and efficacy of adult vaccines; (3) the complexity of selective,
rather than universal, adult vaccination; (4) different target groups for the various adult vaccines; (5) too few
organized programs in either the public or private sector to deliver adult vaccines; and (6) neglect of the
reimbursement system for adult immunization.
The adult population group that consistently receives the highest level of protection against vaccine-
preventable diseases consists of members of the armed forces. Upon enlistment, all military personnel receive
immunizations for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, adenovirus types 4 and 7, and groups A,
C, Y, and W135 meningococcal meningitis. Immunization for influenza is required annually. Other vaccines,
such as those for typhoid, hepatitis B, yellow fever, and rabies, are provided as needed depending on occupation,
specialty, and location of military duty.
39


## p. 40 (#52) ##############################################

Many professional organizations have recommended adult vaccines and have developed programs for
their delivery. Standards for adult immunization practice have been developed by the National Coalition for
Adult Immunization (Centers for Disease Control, 1990). And the Federal Government has taken an active role,
most notably in the Medicare Influenza Vaccine Demonstration conducted during the period from 1988 to 1992.
Pneumococcal vaccine has been covered by Medicare for a number of years, with coverage for influenza
vaccination being added on October 1, 1993. However, there is a continued concern that the physician payment
for vaccine administration is so low ($3.44) that it discourages health care providers from furnishing
immunization services.
The General Accounting Office is conducting a study of strategies used by the Department of Health
and Human Services to improve immunization rates among Medicare beneficiaries. The study, to be completed
in 1994, is focusing on (1) the adult immunization program at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
and (2) coverage and use of immunization services under Medicare programs at the Health Care Financing
Administration. The CDC does not presently provide funds for States to promote adult immunization.
Full use of existing vaccines would prevent many deaths and avert considerable suffering (see table 3).
Any discussion of adult immunization in the United States must take place within the context of the debate over
health care reform. The demonstrated cost-effectiveness of several adult vaccines argues strongly for their fuller
use (see section XI). Improving adult immunization will require greater awareness by the general public and
health care providers of the importance of vaccine-preventable diseases and the effectiveness and safety of the
vaccines. It will also require closer working relationships among health care professionals, vaccine
manufacturers, and the payers for health care services.
A recent report of the NVAC identifies the major goals and recommended strategies for strengthening
adult immunization efforts in the United States (NVAC, 1994b). The NVPO with other agencies (see section X)
will identify steps that Federal agencies can take to implement the NVAC report. Likewise, States will be
encouraged to implement the recommendations in the report. The task is complex and the effort and resources
needed to achieve success will be substantial. The urgent need to address adult immunization vigorously is
highlighted by the dramatic increases expected beyond the year 2000 in the proportion of the total population
that is over the age of 65.
UNDOCUMENTED INDIVD3UALS
One group at particular risk of underimmunization consists of so-called undocumented individuals,
including children, resident in the United States. Reaching and keeping immunization records on undocumented
people pose particular problems because the individuals may deliberately avoid such contacts if they are fearful
of jeopardizing their situation. From a public health perspective, underimmunization of undocumented residents
poses the same threat of disease transmission as does the underimmunization of legal residents. Hence, it is
important that undocumented individuals receive recommended vaccinations both for protection of the public
health and for their own benefit.

VIII. DEVELOPMENT, LICENSURE, RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
USE, AND POSTMARKETING SURVEILLANCE OF VACCINES
Ensuring the safety, efficacy, and consistency of vaccines is a critical part of the overall National
Vaccine Program. A commitment that vaccines used in immunization programs be as free as possible from
adverse consequences permeates all vaccine development and immunization efforts. Vaccine research,
development, and licensure strive to ensure that the approaches selected and the candidates themselves are safe
as well as effective. Appropriate use of vaccines is essential to maintain both the effectiveness and safety of
immunization programs. Postmarketing surveillance (for example, phase IV studies) of vaccines also serves to
monitor and assess safety.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for the licensure of new vaccines and for
ensuring that they continue to meet the prescribed standards for safety, purity, potency, and efficacy after
approval. During development, candidate products are assessed in preclinical animal studies and clinical trials in
humans (phases I, II, III) under investigational new drug applications. Upon completion of the clinical trials, a
Product License Application (PLA) and an Establishment License Application (ELA) are prepared for the
vaccine. The FDA reviews all phases of testing and, upon submission of the PLA and ELA, the agency reviews
the adequacy of the data supporting safety and efficacy and issues a license if appropriate. The FDA is also
responsible for establishing and monitoring compliance with standards for vaccines. The development of
standards requires a scientific research basis; therefore the FDA conducts research to support this activity and
also conducts research in other areas relevant to its mission. The FDA is also responsible for routine lot-by-lot
release of all vaccines and for periodic inspections of vaccine manufacturing facilities.
Rapid and recent developments in biotechnology have identified new approaches to developing vaccines
that may ultimately prove safer than those used historically. However, such developments require new
approaches to vaccine assessment and licensure, and thereby place added stress on the current regulatory system.
With many new products in development, including combination vaccines, it is desirable to identify
ways of simplifying the assessment of vaccines and of reducing the burden of prelicensure testing while
maintaining safety standards. Expanding knowledge of correlates of immunity and of surrogate efficacy markers
is critical to making available safe and effective vaccines. To this end, the FDA and other agencies undertake
and support relevant research.
Appropriate use of vaccines is achieved in a variety of ways. The Vaccines and Related Biological
Products Advisory Committee advises the FDA on issues relating to vaccine use as part of its mandate to
provide advice on the FDA's regulatory decision making. Providers receive guidance on use through the use of
approved labeling of products (package inserts). In addition, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
~ through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - makes recommendations on the use of
vaccines, as do some specialty medical organizations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, which
publishes its guidance in the so-called "Red Book." The public is given information on vaccination risks and
benefits in the form of pamphlets on the vaccines that States require for school entry.
Postlicensure monitoring of possibly vaccine-related adverse events is also a priority. One system for
postlicensure surveillance for safety is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which began
operating on November 1, 1990. Jointly operated by the CDC and the FDA, VAERS provides a single national
repository for the reporting of adverse events following the administration of all vaccines in the United States.
VAERS can detect unusual clustering of serious adverse advents or clinical syndromes after vaccination.
43


## p. 44 (#56) ##############################################

However, VAERS is a passive surveillance system that generally cannot address, in a scientifically
valid manner, the critical question of whether the administration of a vaccine causes an adverse event. One way
to address this question of causation is through the use of large, linked data bases (LLDBs), such as those at the
CDC, in which computerized vaccination records are linked with computerized medical records to assess linkages
between health status and prior vaccination. These data bases represent a unique resource for the systematic and
timely postlicensure evaluation of vaccine safety. Epidemiological studies are another mechanism for evaluating
whether vaccines may or may not be the cause of a particular adverse event. Such studies are generally
performed on an ad hoc basis when surveillance or other sources of data suggest the possibility of a causal
association.
In response to concerns regarding vaccine safety and appropriate compensation for those who suffer
adverse consequences from vaccinations, Congress created the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program
(NVICP) in 1986 through P.L. 99-660. In addition, this legislation mandated reviews of adverse consequences
of pertussis and rubella vaccines (section 312) and other vaccines (section 313). The results of Uiose reviews
have now been published (Institute of Medicine, 1991, 1993). They suggest that for many of the allegedly
vaccine-related adverse events reviewed, the scientific evidence was inadequate to accept or reject a causal
association. They also provide several suggestions for improving scientific understanding of vaccine-related
adverse events.
P.L. 99-660 also mandated the creation of the Task Force on Safer Childhood Vaccines. The task force
anticipates publication of its conclusions and recommendations in a report scheduled for completion in 1994.
Efforts to ensure vaccine safety and public confidence in vaccination are continuously monitored by the
National Vaccine Program Office and other agencies and are modified as necessary in the light of the best
information available. As of January 1994, comprehensive reviews are being conducted of product labeling, the
vaccine information pamphlets on the vaccines required for school entry, the system for identifying vaccine-
related adverse events, and the NVICP Vaccine Injury Table that defines compensable events. To improve on
present levels of vaccine safety, and to maintain pubic confidence and participation in vaccination, expanded
research on efficacy and safety issues will be needed to guide future regulatory decisions and for use in
developing recommendations on vaccine use.

IX.
PRIORITIES FOR FY 1994 AND FY 1995
IMMUNIZATION
The measles epidemics of 1989-91 have shown that the deficiencies of the present health care system,
together with the persistence of certain immunization-specific barriers, can leave as many as half of all young
children in the United States vulnerable to preventable diseases, such as measles, poliomyelitis, pertussis
(whooping cough), mumps, and rubella (German measles), because they do not receive vaccines on the proper
schedule during the critical first two years of life (see section VII). These problems point to the need for urgent
action. Hence the President has proposed and Congress has appropriated funds for the Childhood Immunization
Initiative (CII).
The aims of the CII are to (1) eliminate childhood cases of six vaccine-preventable diseases, namely,
diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type b disease, measles, polio, rubella, and tetanus (see table 6, in appendix
9); (2) increase vaccination coverage levels to at least 90 percent among 2-year-old children by 1996 for each of
the vaccinations recommended routinely (other than hepatitis B, for which the goal is 1998) (see table 7, in
appendix 9); and (3) establish a vaccination delivery system that maintains and further improves high coverage
levels.
Implementing the CII will be a major priority in FY 1994 and FY 1995. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) is the primary agency responsible for implementing the CII. Within the broad,
long-term framework provided by the National Vaccine Plan, the CII will accelerate and strengthen vaccination
awareness, community mobilization, and disease surveillance activities, and will introduce new elements such as
a comprehensive vaccine purchase program and new methods for vaccination coverage measurement. Pursuit of
the CII's focused activities, in concert with those of the overall National Vaccine Plan, will contribute to the
earlier achievement of the plan's goals. Specifically, these CII activities to improve immunization fall into five
main categories:
O Improving the quality and quantity of vaccination delivery services. State and local health
agencies will use new Federal resources to hire personnel, extend clinic hours, and encourage health
care providers to use all health care contacts to administer needed vaccines and reduce the obstacles
that parents encounter in obtaining vaccinations for their children. Computerized State vaccination
information systems are being developed to remind parents when vaccinations are due and to assist
health care providers in determining the vaccination needs of patients. Existing vaccination
schedules will be simplified to facilitate vaccination delivery.
o Increasing community participation, education, and partnerships. A long-term, national
outreach campaign will be initiated in April 1994 to improve parental awareness of the need for
timely childhood vaccination and to prompt health care providers to use all health care contacts to
administer needed vaccines to children. At the national level, elements of this campaign will
include widespread distribution of radio, television, and print public service announcements;
dissemination of a national theme and call to action; and other activities designed to unify efforts
throughout the country. At the State and community levels, the campaign will include a grass roots
organizing effort to unite all sectors of the community (for example, public and private health care
providers, business groups, community leaders, minority groups, voluntary and service
organizations, religious institutions, and media affiliates).
45


## p. 46 (#58) ##############################################

o Reducing vaccine cost for parents. To reduce vaccine cost as a barrier to vaccination, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services will initiate the Vaccines for Children Program on
October 1, 1994. This program, legislated by Congress in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1993, will purchase vaccines from the manufacturers and provide them at no cost to participating
public and private health care providers for use in children aged 0-18 years who are eligible for
Medicaid, are without health insurance, or are Native Americans. Children with health insurance
who are served by federally qualified health centers also will be able to receive free vaccine if their
insurance does not cover vaccination. State vaccination programs will be permitted to purchase
additional vaccines at reduced Federal contract prices.
O Improving monitoring of disease and vaccination coverage. An improved system for
measuring vaccination coverage at the national, State, and local levels among infants and young
children is being established to identify undervaccinated populations and to monitor progress in
achieving coverage goals. Clinic- or office-based assessments are being completed to assist health
care providers in increasing coverage among the populations they serve. Surveillance for vaccine-
preventable diseases will be intensified by investigating each case of disease targeted for elimination
to determine how that case might have been prevented and to enable initiation of aggressive control
measures when such cases are detected.
o Improving vaccines and vaccine use. Further progress in immunization can be achieved by
improving the use of existing vaccines, for example by simplifying the schedules on which they are
used and encouraging development of combination vaccines, and by improving safety and efficacy.
Goals 3 and 4 of the National Vaccine Plan (primarily objectives 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, and
4.6) encompass all the major activities envisaged under the CII. (Priorities of the CDC for implementation of its
responsibilities for the CII and for its other immunization-related activities are summarized in appendix 10).
Activities of the CII lay the groundwork for a general enhancement of immunization; during FY 1994 and FY
1995, the NVPO with other agencies will identify steps that Federal agencies can take to implement the National
Vaccine Advisory Committee report on "Adult Immunization."
VACCINE DEVELOPMENT
The setting of public health priorities in vaccine development over the last few years has been based on
Institute of Medicine (IOM) studies (see section III) in conjunction with assessments of emerging scientific
opportunities. (For the present status of earlier priorities, see National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, 1993, pp 3-4). Where a vaccine has not yet been licensed, vaccine candidates previously ranked as
priorities remain so. These include vaccines for pertussis (improved), respiratory syncytial virus infection,
influenza (improved), malaria, parainfluenza virus infection, pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, shigella, and group
B streptococcal disease.
In recent years, priority has also been placed on vaccines to prevent HIV infection (because of the
growth in the pandemic in recent years), on other sexually transmitted diseases (in their own right and because
they enhance HIV transmission), and on tuberculosis (because of its resurgence). Emphasis has also been
increased on combination vaccines (not studied by IOM) that can simplify vaccination delivery; vaccine
improvement, particularly to make delivery easier, is included in the CII.
In addition to these specific vaccine candidates, priorities in basic vaccine-related research and in
vaccine development infrastructure strengthening have been identified by the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (see appendix 6).
A contract for the updating of the prior IOM study on priority setting is expected to start in FY 1994.
The analysis should be complete in 2 years from initiation. In the future, the setting of priorities for accelerated
46


## p. 47 (#59) ##############################################

/
vaccine development will also benefit from improved surveillance for emerging infections as envisaged in the
CDC plan for these activities (see appendix 4).
Review of Product License Applications for varicella (chicken pox) and hepatitis A vaccines is also
being conducted as a matter of priority.
POLICY AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT
The National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO), in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health,
the Department of Defense, the Food and Drug Administration, the CDC, the U.S. Agency for International
Development, and the private sector will identify barriers to accelerated development of new and improved
vaccines and will assess options for addressing these barriers, including consideration of the recent IOM proposal
for a National Vaccine Authority with the capacity for pilot-lot vaccine manufacturing. The NVPO also plans to
hold discussions with vaccine companies to strengthen private-sector involvement in preparing future versions of
the National Vaccine Plan.
The coming biennium will probably see the licensure of one or more new vaccines or combinations.
The NVPO will coordinate among the relevant Federal agencies, States, and private-sector entities, including
vaccine companies, to establish policies and procedures to optimize new vaccine introduction and early use, and
apply these as new vaccines become imminent.
In FY 1994 the NVPO will initiate revision of the Nation's plan for responding to the threat of
pandemic influenza, which has not been updated since 1983 and will review the need to prepare plans to
anticipate other emerging threats for which vaccines might be necessary (see appendix 4).
In collaboration with participating agencies, the NVPO will identify and provide support for selected,
urgent vaccine development or immunization-related activities that support the goals and objectives of the
National Vaccine Plan, where further investigation of such possibilities should not be delayed by the usual
budget cycle. Support for these opportunities will be time-limited; continued support will be through their
incorporation into Federal agency budget requests.
As the CII is implemented, various issues relating to vaccination delivery that need analysis or health
services research will undoubtedly be identified. Studies to address such problems will be conducted by the
NVPO or through other agencies collaborating in the National Vaccine Program.
IMPLICATIONS OF HEALTH CARE REFORM
The fact that immunization averts disease, disability, and death very effectively argues compellingly for
its prominent inclusion as a covered benefit in health care reform. Moreover, the protection afforded by vaccines
is achieved very cost effectively; immunization can be cost saving and could lower health costs (see section XI).
However, vaccination must be delivered to be effective. Unfortunately, there are many barriers to vaccination
that arise from shortfalls in the present overall health care delivery system and from inadequate access to care.
Overcoming these is inextricably intertwined with overall questions of health care reform. Such issues include
affordability of vaccination services, ensured through adequate financing; availability, guaranteed by access to a
health care provider; and appropriateness of the services to consumer needs. Other needs for improving
immunization efforts are also linked with desirable reforms in health care, such as developing the capability to
track the services, including vaccinations, that individuals receive. Such systems also can maintain public health
department accountability for disease prevention and control.
Much can and will be done in the forthcoming year to improve the Nation's vaccination system. In
addition, the NVPO will continue to address the issues outlined above, through analysis or health services
research, in the context of health care reform.

X.
COORDINATION
For the mission of the National Vaccine Program (NVP) to be accomplished, it is essential that there be
effective coordination of the one dozen or more participating Federal agencies (see figure 9 for a summary of
their involvement in each of the four major goals of the National Vaccine Plan).
The principal coordinating organization for the NVP is the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO),
within the Public Health Service (PHS). The NVPO's responsibilities include providing overall leadership for the
collaborative effort and monitoring the progress being made in achieving the plan's goals. Within the PHS, the
NVPO has the task of reviewing all budget requests associated with vaccine development and immunization
programs to ensure that all major priorities are adequately covered and that there is no duplication of effort.
Various entities participate in the process of guiding and coordinating NVP activities. For example, the
National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) (composed of nongovernmental experts in vaccine development
and immunization) provides overall advice on vaccine development and immunization, as specified under P.L.
99-660. As of January 1994, NVAC subcommittees are addressing a variety of key issues, such as:
o barriers to immunization at the State and local levels;
o adult immunization;
o characteristics desirable in "future vaccines," such as the timing of doses and potential for
combination or coadministration, that should be considered in vaccine development planning;
o immunization registries; and
o vaccine safety.
Two formal mechanisms exist for coordinating Federal activity. The NVP Interagency Group includes
those agencies with major vaccine-related responsibilities specifically mentioned in P.L. 99-660, and the
Interagency Committee on Immunization (ICI) includes all those Federal departments and agencies involved in
immunization (see appendix 3). Each of these groups meets regularly to supplement day-to-day information
exchange, and coordination, cooperation, and planning that is facilitated by the NVPO staff.
In addition, the NVPO coordinates special cross-agency initiatives that are undertaken from time to time
on specific topics of importance or other identified needs. Currently, for example, the NVPO is working on a
planning initiative that will lead to an improved national response to pandemic influenza and on the transfer of
technology from Federal agencies to the private sector to promote vaccine development. In addition, the NVPO
is responsible for convening PHS experts and outside consultants to provide scientific advice to the Department
of Agriculture on the public health issues related to the use of veterinary vaccines.
Implementation of vaccination programs, as a public health measure, is the statutory responsibility of the
States. Therefore, coordination between Federal agencies and State and territorial health agencies is also
essential. Traditionally this task has been predominately undertaken by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention as the main agency providing financial and technical assistance on immunization to the States. With
the increasing role of social service programs as vehicles to promote immunization, coordination needs are

broadening. The ICI serves to ensure that the activities of all Federal programs related to immunization are
consistent and coordinated.
Creation of the National Vaccine Plan has highlighted the need for expanded consultation and
cooperation among particular participants in the overall national effort for disease prevention through vaccine
development and immunization (see figure 2). Of critical importance is the need to develop approaches to
acknowledge, identify, and better incorporate into the National Vaccine Plan (and the overall national effort) the
contributions that vaccine companies are making to public health needs. Development of ways to achieve this
collaboration is a priority for FY 1994 and FY 1995.

OVERVIEW OF INVESTMENT AND
RESOURCE ALLOCATION
The benefits of investment in vaccine development and immunization accrue across the whole of
society, and even across political borders. Vaccinated individuals benefit directly, unvaccinated individuals
benefit from reduced transmission of diseases in the community, and all people benefit from reduced costs to
society for medical care.
THE BENEFIT/COST OF IMMUNIZATION
Many studies have analyzed the benefits and costs of childhood immunization based on the vaccines
recommended for routine use in the United States (see appendix 6). For example, the benefit/cost ratios of the
measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines (whether the vaccines are administered individually or in combination)
have been documented repeatedly (table 4; see also appendix 11). These studies show that immunization not
only yields considerable disease-reduction benefits, but also reduces the need for rehabilitation and other medical
services and offers substantial economic benefit in the form of savings in costs that would have been incurred
had the disease and its complications not been prevented.

Immunization of adults is also cost-effective. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination of the elderly are
cost saving because the cost of vaccinating elderly persons is less than the cost of providing medical care, such
as hospitalization, to those who would otherwise develop influenza or pneumonia (National Vaccine Advisory
Committee, 1994b).
On a global scale the benefit/cost of immunization and the priority it should be given among public
health interventions has been recently highlighted in the World Bank's "World Development Report --1993:
Investing in Health" (World Bank, 1993). U.S. contributions to global immunization efforts can have monetary
as well as health benefits. For example, the United States' expenditure of $84 million on global smallpox
eradication between 1967 and 1977 has resulted in a cost savings of $150 million a year for the U.S. taxpayers,
because domestic control measures could be discontinued.
INVESTMENTS IN THE NATIONAL VACCINE PLAN
The National Vaccine Plan's specific goals, objectives, and strategies are identified; they are realistic and
achievable. Many of the activities through which the strategies will be implemented will not require new
funding, and some will be achievable with only very little additional funding. A few, however, will require
substantial new funding that will be considered for future Presidential budget requests. FY 1994 congressional
appropriations make possible revitalization of our national efforts through the President's Childhood

Settlements from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) for injury prior to 1988
are from appropriations; those for injury after 1988 are from a vaccine surcharge.
Although the Federal contribution to vaccine development and immunization is critical, other
investments, for example by States and commercial vaccine companies, are also necessary. Although these
contributions are not discussed in detail in this initial plan, they will be covered in future plans to the extent that
the appropriate information is available.

XII.
PREDICTED OUTCOMES OF THE
NATIONAL VACCINE PLAN
The National Vaccine Plan provides a blueprint for disease prevention through the development and use
of safe and effective vaccines. Provision of adequate resources for full and active pursuit of this plan could
bring substantial health benefits and ultimately reduce health care costs. It will improve coordination among
government agencies, industry, health-care providers, community leaders, and the general public. It will raise
awareness and increase the utilization of vaccines, especially by populations at risk of underimmunization.
Sustained commitment and support of all elements in the plan are essential to effective disease prevention
through immunization.
The success of the National Vaccine Plan must be measured by its outcomes (by the year 2000). The
impact of full implementation of this plan on the health of children and adults in the United States will be
profound in both human and economic terms. The predicted outcomes are:
o Age-appropriate immunization with all recommended vaccines will be extended to at least 90
percent of infants and children, and access to affordable vaccination services will be made available
for every person in the United States.
o Diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis, measles, rubella, mumps, some forms of hepatitis, pertussis
(whooping cough), and bacterial meningitis (from Haemophilus influenzae type b) will be
essentially eliminated as significant causes of death, disease, and disability in the United States.
o Educational communication networks will be in place that will inform all health care providers,
communities, and families of the benefits and risks of vaccination.
o In a global context, polio will be drastically reduced, if not eliminated, and neonatal tetanus and
measles will be better controlled.
o Pneumococcal pneumonia and influenza in American adults over the age of 65 will be significantly
reduced.
o A nationwide system will monitor the vaccines that children receive, and will remind parents when
individual infants and children should be vaccinated.
o A nationwide surveillance system will report and investigate cases of vaccine-preventable diseases.
o Vaccine safety and efficacy will be continuously monitored, and adverse events following
immunization will be reported and carefully analyzed.
o Improved vaccines will replace some of the vaccines in current use.
o Some vaccines requiring multiple doses and multiple contacts with the health care system will be
replaced by more cost-effective ones that will improve people's access to immunization.
55


## p. 56 (#68) ##############################################

o Many new vaccines will be developed, or be much closer to licensure, for diseases for which
effective vaccines do not now exist.
o New mechanisms for the more rapid assessment of vaccines proposed for licensure will be in place.
o A reliable supply of all recommended vaccines and a capability to respond to emergencies and
emergent threats to public health will be achieved and sustained.
o Information on the costs and benefits of the National Vaccine Plan will be made available on an
ongoing basis to the American people.

Appendix 2
MAJOR FEDERAL ORGANIZATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR
VACCINE- AND IMMUNIZATION-RELATED ACTIVITIES
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES (HHS)
The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) administers the Child Care and Development Block
Grant Program. The Head Start program in ACF provides comprehensive educational, health, nutritional, social,
and other services for low-income children between the age of 3 and the age of compulsory school attendance,
and for their families. In addition, Head Start Migrant Programs serve migrant children from birth to the age of
3, and Head Start Parent and Child Centers exclusively serve children from birth to the age of 3 and pregnant
women. The health component of Head Start ensures the provision of comprehensive health services, including
immunizations, for all Head Start children. Head Start's Performance Standards require the assessment of current
immunization status and the provision of age-appropriate immunizations for all enrolled children.
The Health Care Financing Administration provides national direction and oversight for the Medicare program
and the State-administered Medicaid program. Immunization appropriate to age and health history is a required
component of Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program for eligible
individuals under the age of 21. The Medicare program provides coverage for pneumococcal pneumonia,
influenza, and hepatitis B vaccination for beneficiaries at high and intermediate risk of infection.
PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE (PHS)
The National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) has the leadership responsibility for the Nation's vaccine
development and immunization program. Specifically, the NVPO was established to "coordinate and provide
direction for" each element of the immunization process: vaccine development, testing for safety and efficacy
prior to licensure, licensing, production, procurement, distribution, delivery, and continued evaluation of vaccines
after licensure.
The Agency for Health Care Policy Research (AHCPR) studies the nature, costs, and delivery of health
services, including immunization. AHCPR promotes work on the identification of barriers to vaccination,
including those reflecting access to health services in general, financial barriers, and the attitudes of health care
providers and the general public, particularly parents. It also supports assessment of the role of data/reporting
systems in ensuring delivery of vaccination, particularly to populations at risk of underimmunization.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides national direction and leadership, project
grant support, technical assistance and consultation, national surveillance, assessment, training, and epidemic
investigations assistance to assist State and local health agencies in planning and implementing immunization
programs. It also conducts research to improve diagnostic tests for vaccine-preventable diseases. CDC
Immunization grants provided to States and some large county and city health departments are intended to assist
with the purchase of adequate supplies of vaccines and to supplement State and local immunization efforts.
These immunization grants currently support vaccine purchases that meet approximately half of the public-sector
vaccine needs, although the proportion varies by specific vaccine. These grants also support administrative
activities such as the assessment of immunization coverage, promotion of vaccination, and surveillance of disease
and adverse events associated with the use of vaccines. In addition, since 1992, CDC immunization grants have
been used to supplement State and local health agencies' efforts to improve vaccine delivery to the preschool
population.
63


## p. 64 (#76) ##############################################

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for the licensure of new vaccines, ensuring that the
new vaccines meet requirements for safety, purity, potency, and efficacy. The licensing process encompasses the
FDA's evaluation (Investigational New Drug Application), monitoring and evaluating the vaccine during the
different stages of clinical trial, and granting a license if appropriate. Additionally, during the licensing process,
the FDA establishes standards and criteria for the release of each vaccine lot. The FDA is responsible for the lot
release of each vaccine and uses its laboratories to conducts lot release tests, such as the neurovirulence test for
polio and the potency test for pertussis. The FDA is responsible for the periodic inspection of vaccine
manufacturing facilities and the monitoring and evaluating of vaccine adverse effects; it also is responsible for
overseeing compliance with its regulations. To help carry out its mission, the FDA maintains an active research
program in vaccine-related topics, and convenes workshops and symposia related to vaccine functioning and
testing.
The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) supports the provision of immunizations through
HRSA-funded primary care programs and through the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program. It also
supports immunizations through the Healthy Start initiative.
HRSA's Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) funds immunizations as a component of comprehensive
primary care services offered through funded Community and Migrant Health Centers (C/MHCs). The BPHC is
collaborating with the CDC's National Immunization Program to ensure adequate vaccine supplies for C/MHCs
and to undertake several evaluation and demonstration projects. The bureau also is working with the Corporation
for National Black Churches and the Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service to train and
utilize volunteers to assist local health and social service programs in reaching medically underserved people
with services, including immunizations.
The Bureau of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) administers the Maternal and Child Health Block
Grant programs which supports 59 States and jurisdictions in the provision of health care services to targeted
populations on a three-for-four match. For FY 1994, $574.5 million has been appropriated for State grants as
part of the MCH Block Grant program. The bureau also administers Special Projects of Regional and National
Significance (SPRANS) and Community Integrated Service System (CISS) projects, which add an additional
$112.5 million for a total of $687 million in the MCH Block Grant. A substantial portion of MCH Block Grant
funds are used by States to enhance the delivery of immunizations as a part of comprehensive child health
services provided at local health departments.
The Healthy Start initiative is a demonstration program that provides resources and technical assistance
for 15 urban and rural communities with infant mortality rates of between 1.5 and 2.5 times the national average.
Its goal is to reduce infant mortality by 50 percent in these selected high-risk areas by October 1996. For FY
1994, $97.4 million has been appropriated for comprehensive child health services, including immunizations.
Included within HRSA's Bureau of Health Professions is the Division of Vaccine Injury Compensation,
which is responsible for the HHS medical reviews and payment of claims filed under the National Vaccine
Injury Compensation Program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is represented by Department of
Justice attorneys in proceedings before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.
The Indian Health Service (MS) carries out its responsibilities to provide immunization services for the Native
American population through development and operation of a health care services delivery system that integrates
preventive health into an overall system of health care. Preventive health services are delivered by IHS tribally
managed or urban Indian health care facilities. For the most part, the States provide vaccines for IHS clients.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports investigation on all classes of infectious diseases. NIH is
made up of 14 Institutes, 11 of which support vaccine research for both infectious diseases and noninfectious
diseases, including autoimmune disease and cancers. Intramural laboratories focus on vaccine research. Clinical
evaluation of candidate vaccines is complemented by extensive collaboration with industry. Centers support the
investigation of key areas of vaccinology. Together with a program of basic research on the human immune
system, these centers nurture a comprehensive and collaborative vaccine effort among extramural scientists in
government, industry, and academic institutions.
64


## p. 65 (#77) ##############################################

The Office of Minority Health (OMH) serves as an advocate for action on minority health issues within the
PHS. It serves as a catalyst for collaboration among PHS agencies, HHS operating divisions, other Federal
departments, and non-Federal partners on minority health issues and projects. Working with the Office of
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion and the NVPO, OMH facilitates the distribution of immunization
materials targeted to minority populations.
The Office of the Surgeon General has the responsibility for advising the public on emerging public health
issues of concern, with an emphasis on controlling epidemics. In response to the 1989-91 measles epidemics, the
Surgeon General is giving priority to promoting the appropriate and timely administration of childhood
immunizations.
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) supports the plan to assess the immunization
status of persons receiving assistance through various Federal programs, including Public Housing programs.
Public Housing serves over 4 million people, of whom 1.5 million are children. HUD is increasing its
coordination efforts with Resident Management Groups and public housing authorities across the country so that
resident awareness of the need for immunization is enhanced and accessibility of services to client children is
facilitated.
DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
The Department of Agriculture (USDA) has begun a cooperative effort with the CDC to increase immunization
coverage among preschool children who participate in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women,
Infants and Children (WIC). The WIC program has regulatory responsibility to coordinate with other programs
providing immunization services. Many WIC local agencies are located on-site with health care services where
immunizations are available. Other WIC agencies refer participants to other health care providers in the
community for immunization. Child care providers and centers participating in the USDA Child and Adult Care
Food Program (CACFP) are encouraged to become involved in promoting immunization.
Also, as part of its national "Decisions For Health" and "Plight of Young Children" education initiatives,
the USDA's Cooperative Extension Service (CES) works in close partnership with several HHS operating
divisions, including the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, the CDC, and HRSA's BPHC, to
organize and activate communities to immunize their children. The CES is a national educational network with
links to the 74 land-grant universities, a number of the medical schools and teaching hospitals located on those
campuses, and 3,150 county extension offices. Through its professional staff, trained volunteers, and advanced
telecommunications capabilities, the CES is educating families as to why it is critical to immunize their children
and how they can access the appropriate health care resources that provide immunization services.
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
The Department of Education has a working agreement with HHS that fosters relationships at State and local
levels to ensure the availability, accessibility, and quality of comprehensive health care (including immunization
and other preventive health services) for the children of migrant farm workers. The Department of Education's
Office of Migrant Education also provides financial assistance for State education agencies to establish or
improve education programs designed to meet the special educational and support needs of children of migrant
workers in agriculture and fisheries. A key component of the Migrant Education Program is the Migrant Student
Record Transfer System, which system contains health records used by local health centers.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
The Department of Defense (DOD) runs a comprehensive immunization program that is designed to protect
defense forces against foreseeable threats from infectious diseases. Because there is a large active-duty military
force, plus a large number of reservists, and dependents who receive vaccines, the DOD immunization program
affects a significant portion of the Nation's population.
65


## p. 66 (#78) ##############################################

DOD develops vaccines to protect against diseases that are of military significance and that are not
covered by routine civilian immunizations. This development effort includes research on causative agents,
immunological responses, selection of candidate vaccines, and pilot vaccine preparation. DOD collaborates with
industry on the manufacture and testing of new vaccines.
U.S. AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) supports key immunization-related activities as part
of its child survival program. These activities include applied research for the development and evaluation of
new and improved vaccines for diseases of greatest significance (including malaria, diarrheal disease, and
pneumonia) in developing countries. By supporting epidemiological and vaccine research in institutions in
developing countries, USAID helps to build up the capacity of scientists in these countries to conduct their own
research. In addition, USAID's efforts help to foster the commitment of policy makers in these countries to use
research results in immunization programs. Immunization delivery activities are a central component of USAID's
health strategy. These activities consist of efforts to promote a sustainable supply of high-quality vaccines, to
improve logistics, and to institutionalize delivery systems and country-level data collection programs that can
provide ministries of health and program managers with information on vaccination coverage and disease
incidence.

LIST OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE NATIONAL VACCINE PLAN
The National Vaccine Plan is the result of more than 3 years of deliberation and analysis. It draws on
the decades-long experience of the Public Health Service, other Federal organizations, vaccine companies, and
other nongovernment entities. It also has benefited from valuable input from the Advisory Commission on
Childhood Vaccines; national, State, and local health offices; health practitioners; members of academia; and
community groups.
The plan has been prepared by the National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO) through the National
Vaccine Program Interagency Group and the Interagency Committee on Immunization. The plan's development
was facilitated by the work of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee. Principal staff and editorial
responsibility for the early development of the plan was carried out by Kenneth J. Bart, Kimi F.Y. Lin, and
Chester A. Robinson, all of the NVPO. The final version of the plan was prepared by Roy Widdus, NVPO,
under the guidance of Anthony Robbins, [Director-designate], NVPO.
The NVPO would like to express its appreciation to the staff who facilitated the work of the plan's
development. The NVPO gratefully acknowledges the efforts of its staff members assigned to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the
Health Care Finance Administration for their help in translating early discussions into prose for further review:
respectively, they are Stephen Sepe, William Stevens, and Joan Mahanes. The NVPO especially thanks Joan
Wilmarth Blair and Nicole Rosettie for their superb support over the course of tlie plan's preparation. Others
within the NVPO who were instrumental in seeing the project to completion were Jeannette De Lawter, Donna
Cochrane, and Sandra Tolpin. Finally, the NVPO gratefully recognizes Paul Elliott for his editorial contributions
to the manuscript.

Preface
The spectrum of infectious diseases is changing
rapidly in conjunction with dramatic changes in our
society and environment. Worldwide, there is explo-
sive population growth with expanding poverty and
urban migration; international travel is increasing;
and technology is rapidly changing—all of which af-
fect our relationships to the infectious agents with
which we share our environment. Despite historical
predictions to the contrary, we remain vulnerable
to a wide array of new and reemerging infectious
diseases.
Evidence of our vulnerability is readily available
in 1993: a once obscure intestinal parasite, Crypto-
sporidium, caused the largest waterborne disease
outbreak ever recognized in this country; an emerg-
ing bacterial pathogen, Escherichia coli 0157:H7,
caused a multi-state foodborne outbreak of severe
bloody diarrhea and kidney failure; and a pre-
viously unknown hantavirus, producing an often le-
thal lung infection, has been linked to exposure to
infected rodents. In addition, our antimicrobial
drugs are becoming less effective against many in-
fectious agents and experts in infectious diseases
are considering the possibility of a "post-antibiotic
era."
At the same time, our ability to detect, contain,
and prevent emerging infectious diseases is in jeop-
ardy. Between 1987 and 1993, the National Acad-
emy of Science's Institute of Medicine published
three reports, each of which documents, from differ-
ent perspectives, how poorly prepared the United
States is to identify and respond to infectious dis-
ease threats. Central to this poor state of prepared-
ness is an overall erosion of the public health
infrastructure at the local, state, and federal levels.
As our nation proceeds with health reform, we must
identify those public health priorities that need to
be addressed at the community level as well as
those that can be addressed by individual patient
care providers.
We must also recognize that the health of the
American people is inextricably linked to the health
of people in other nations throughout the world,
that infectious diseases can and do spread rapidly
around the globe, and that global surveillance for
emerging infections is vital to the health of our
country.
In partnership with local and state public health
officials, other federal agencies, medical and public
health professional associations, infectious disease
experts from academia and clinical practice, and in-
ternational organizations, CDC has developed a
plan that addresses the priorities set forth in
Healthy People 2000 and the three Institute of Medi
cine reports and will serve as a roadmap for CDC
and its partners in safeguarding this nation from
the ongoing threat of emerging infectious diseases.
Development of this plan began in December
1992 at a meeting of the Board of Scientific Counsel
ors of CDC's National Center for Infectious Dis-
eases. Input was subsequently obtained at a
meeting of infectious disease and public health ex-
perts at CDC in March 1993 and at a meeting of
state and territorial public health professionals in
Minneapolis, Minnesota in June 1993. Drafts of
this plan have also been reviewed by several medi-
cal and scientific organizations and societies. The
input and assistance obtained throughout this proc-
ess have been invaluable in ensuring that the plan
reflects the public health concerns and expertise of
a wide array of medical and public health experts.
Plan implementation will be driven by public
health priorities and resource availability and will
require long-term collaboration of public agencies,
universities, professional societies, and private in-
dustry to ensure protection of the U.S. population
from the threat of emerging infections.

Executive Summary
Once expected to be eliminated as a public health
problem, infectious diseases remain the leading cause
of death worldwide. Dramatic changes in society, tech-
nology, and the environment together with the dimin-
ished effectiveness of certain approaches to disease
control have propelled this nation and the rest of the
world into a new era; the spectrum of infectious dis-
eases is expanding and many infectious diseases once
thought conquered are increasing. To effectively ad-
dress emerging infectious diseases, the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention has developed a strategic
plan emphasizing surveillance, research, and preven-
tion activities critical to maintaining a strong defense
against infectious diseases that affect, or threaten to
affect, the public's health.
The Concept of Emergence
Emerging infectious diseases are diseases of infec-
tious origin whose incidence in humans has increased
within the past two decades or threatens to increase in
the near future.1
Many factors, or combinations of factors, can con-
tribute to disease emergence (Table 1). Newly emer-
gent infectious diseases may result from changes or
evolution of existing organisms; known diseases may
spread to new geographic areas or new human popula-
tions; or previously unrecognized infections may ap-
pear in persons living or working in areas undergoing
ecologic changes, such as deforestation or reforesta-
tion, that increase their exposure to insects, animals,
or environmental sources that may harbor new or un-
usual infectious agents.
Reemergence may occur because of the develop-
ment of antimicrobial resistance in existing agents
(e.g., gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease) or
breakdowns in public health measures for previously
controlled infections (e.g., cholera, tuberculosis, measles).
The Threat of Emerging Infections
In the United States and elsewhere, infectious dis-
eases increasingly threaten public health and contrib-
ute significantly to the escalating costs of health care.
As society, technology, and the environment change,
pathogens evolve or spread, and the spectrum of infec-
tious diseases expands.
Emerging infections, such as acquired immunodefi-
ciency syndrome (AIDS) and tuberculosis (TB), vividly
illustrate that no nation can be complacent regarding
human vulnerability to the microorganisms with
which we share our environment. Since the early
1970s, the U.S. public health system has been chal-
lenged by many newly identified pathogens and syn-
dromes, such as Legionnaires' disease, Lyme disease,
toxic shock syndrome, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C virus,
and, most recently, hantavirus.
In addition, the incidence of many diseases widely
presumed to be under control—such as cholera, ma-
laria, dengue hemorrhagic fever, yellow fever, and
TB—has increased in many areas or spread to new re-
gions or populations throughout the world. As a conse-
quence of widespread use and misuse of antimicrobial
drugs, this country also faces the emergence of drug-re-
sistant pathogens . Even drugs used in the treatment
of common bacterial infections are becoming increas-
ingly ineffective, resulting in prolonged illnesses,
higher mortality rates, and higher health care costs.
Emerging infections place an excessive burden on
persons with lowered immunity, such as those infected
with HIV and those receiving medications for cancer
or organ transplantation—populations that are in-
creasing in number; persons being cared for in institu-
tional settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes;
and traditionally underserved populations, such as the
homeless, migrant farm workers, and others of low so-
cioeconomic status.

The number of children cared for in day care facili-
ties has increased dramatically in the past decade as
mothers of young children have increasingly entered
the work force. These children, now numbering over
LI million, are at a markedly increased risk for multi-
ple diarrheal illnesses, such as hepatitis A, giardiasis,
and cryptosporidiosis; respiratory illnesses; and mid-
dle ear infections. Emerging infections transmitted by
contaminated food items and public water supplies
place entire communities at risk. Additionally, many
of these illnesses are earned home to infect other mem-
bers of a household. Clearly, emerging infections can
affect people everywhere, regardless of lifestyle, cul-
tural or ethnic background, or socioeconomic status.
Once considered "exotic," tropical infectious dis-
eases have an increasing impact on the American pub-
lic. Although the true impact is unknown, several
recent examples include severe illness and at least one
death due to cholera among international airline pas-
sengers arriving in California; malaria-induced fevers
in residents of southern California and immigrants in
North Carolina; fever and heart failure in New York
and Canada among patients who received blood trans-
fusions contaminated with the bloodborne parasite
that causes Chagas' disease in Latin America; and a
newly-described form of the parasitic blood and bone
marrow infection, leishmaniasis, in returning Desert
Storm troops.

Early in 1993, hamburgers contaminated with
the bacterium Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and
served at a fast-food restaurant chain caused a
multi-state outbreak of hemorrhagic colitis and seri-
ous kidney disease, resulting in the deaths of at
least four children.
In the spring of 1993, a municipal water supply
contaminated with the intestinal parasite Crypto-
sporidium caused the largest recognized outbreak
of waterborne illness in the history of the United
States; an estimated 370,000 persons in Milwau-
kee, Wisconsin had prolonged diarrhea, and ap-
proximately 4,100 persons required hospitalization.
In both outbreaks, inadequate surveillance and
I inaccurate diagnosis interfered with public health
! efforts, koth E. coli and Cryptosporidium were first j
j recognized as significant human pathogens in the
I early 1980s, but neither received adequate public
. health attention.
"...the microbe that felled one child in a
distant continent yesterday can reach yours
today and seed a global pandemic tomorrow."
Joshua Lederberg
From a historical perspective, cholera, smallpox,
and the plague are examples of infectious diseases
that spread globally with devastating impact. In mod-
ern times, travel and commerce have fostered the
worldwide spread of HTV7AIDS and influenza as well
as the reemergence of cholera as a global health
threat. As Nobel Laureate, Dr. Joshua Lederberg has
stated, 'The microbe that felled one child in a distant
continent yesterday can reach yours today and seed a
global pandemic tomorrow."
...the public health infrastructure of this
country is poorly prepared to confront the
emerging disease problems of a rapidly
changing world.
The public health infrastructure of this country is
poorly prepared to confront the emerging disease prob-
lems of a rapidly changing world. Current systems
that monitor infectious diseases domestically and in-
ternationally are inadequate to confront the present
and future challenges presented by emerging infec-
tions. Many foodborne and waterborne disease out-
breaks go unrecognized or are detected late; the
magnitude of drug resistance is unknown; and global
surveillance is rudimentary.
National surveillance of infect ious di seases in the
United States is heavily dependent upon voluntary col-
laboration between the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and state and local health de-

partments, which in turn depend on physician-initi-
ated reporting of a limited number of specific, recog-
nized infectious diseases. Reporting is generally
incomplete.
Results from a recent survey by the Council of State
and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) illustrate the
inadequacy of existing infectious disease surveillance
by documenting the limited number of professional po-
sitions dedicated to infectious disease surveillance in
most states. For example, in over 259r of the 50 states
surveyed, no professional position is dedicated to sur-
veillance of foodborne and waterborne diseases. Fund-
ing for communicable disease surveillance is largely
confined to diseases for which public health crises
have already developed; over 959r> of funds allocated to
states for infectious disease surveillance are targeted
to four disease categories (TB, HP//AIDS, sexually
transmitted diseases [STDsl, and selected vaccine pre-
ventable diseases).- No federal resources are provided
to state and local health departments to support the
national notifiable disease system. In addition, the
ability of state public health laboratories to support
surveillance and control of infectious diseases has di-
minished.
Timely recognition of emerging infections requires
early warning systems to detect these diseases before
they develop into public health crises. Prompt detec-
tion of these new threats depends on careful monitor-
ing by modern surveillance systems and a thorough
understanding of trends in incidence and distribution
of known infectious agents.
The ability to detect what is new or
reemerging depends on the capacity to identify
and track the routine as well as the unusual.
To develop and implement rapid, effective preven-
tion and control measures for emerging infections,
good surveillance systems are needed to detect infec-
tious diseases before they become widespread. The
ability to detect what is new or reemerging, however,
depends on the capacity to identify and track the rou-
tine as well as the unusual. Like radar or "early warn
ing" systems that detect threats to national security,
surveillance and appropriate laboratory support are
critical to an effective defense against these diseases.
They are the most important tools for determining
which infectious diseases are emerging, causing seri-
ous public health problems, or receding.
Like radar or "early warning" systems that
detect threats to national security, surveillance
and appropriate laboratory support are critical
to an effective defense against these diseases.
Effective surveillance also provides a basis for
evaluating the outcome of both public health and per-
sonal medical care programs. Surveillance information
is useful in ensuring the use of the most efficacious
and cost-effective approaches to preventive, as well as
curative, health care. Whatever shape health reform
takes in this country, surveillance will be key to the
meaningful evaluation of new programs.
In addition to comprehensive and innovative sur-
veillance systems, effective preparation for emerging
infectious diseases requires sound foundations in pro-
fessional expertise, laboratory support, and research
capability. These foundations support the infrastruc-
ture needed to address the ongoing, but often chang-
ing, threats from emerging infections. Despite the
continued emergence of such threats, support for ap-
plied research and control efforts has declined over the
past decade for most infectious diseases.
As highlighted in three recent reports by commit-
tees of medical and public health experts convened by
the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medi-
cine (IOM), the ability of the U.S. public health system
and our health professionals to deal with emerging in-
fectious disease problems is in jeopardy.13A The earli-
est of these reports, "The U.S. Capacity to Address
Tropical Infectious Disease Problems,"3 published in
1987, documented our poor state of readiness to recog-
nize, treat, or control infectious disease threats ema-
nating from the tropics—regions which have yielded
microbial threats such as AIDS, Lassa fever and Ebola
viruses, chloroquine-resistant malaria, and penicillin-
resistant gonorrhea. The second report, "The Future of
Public Health," published in 1988, concluded that the
U.S. public health system is in disarray. It empha-
sized that the U.S. approach to public health has too
often been crisis driven, an approach that is costly be-
cause it blocks our ability to institute cost-saving pre-
ventive strategies.4
The third IOM report, "Emerging Infections, Micro-
bial Threats to Health in the United States," publish-
ed in 1992, emphasized the ongoing threat to domestic
and global health from emerging infectious diseases.1
The report provided specific recommendations for
CDC, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the
Food ani Drug Administration (FDA), the Department
of Defense (DOD), and other state and federal agen-
cies for addressing microbial threats to health in the
United States and elsewhere. This report. emphasized
a critical leadership role for CDC in a national and
global effort to detect and control emerging infectious
disease threats.
The CDC Plan
To effectively detect and prevent emerging infec-
tions, significant changes are needed in public health
systems, program design, and infrastructure. Toward
this end and the achievement of the objectives of
Healthy People 2000, CDC has developed a strategy to
address these microbial threats. Because meeting the
broad challenge of emerging infections requires inter-
action, cooperation, and coordination among a wide
range of public and private organizations, the develop-
ment of this strategy has taken place in partnership
with other federal agencies, state and local health de-

partments, academic institutions, international organi
zations, and others.
CDC's plan. "A Prevention Strategy for the United
States," contains four critical goals that address, in a
broader context, specific IOM recommendations for re-
vitalizing our nation's ability to identify, contain, and
most importantly, prevent illness from emerging infec-
tious diseases (Table 2).
• Goal I (Surveillance) emphasizes the
improvement and expansion of surveillance
capabilities for infectious diseases in the United
States and internationally. Included under this goal
are plans for strengthening the local and state
public health infrastructures for infectious disease
surveillance, establishing provider-based sentinel
surveillance networks, and creating
population-based Emerging Infections Prevention
and Research Centers at various sites across the
United States. Also included are plans for a global
consortium of closely linked
epidemiology/biomedical research centers to
promote the detection, monitoring, and
investigation of emerging infections. Other
objectives under Goal I emphasize improved
detection of antimicrobial resistance by better
monitoring of trends in antimicrobial resistance in
institutional as well as community settings;
prevention of foodbome and waterborne infections;
and improved knowledge of the distribution of
animal reservoirs and vectors associated with
human infectious diseases.
• Goal II (Research) focuses on applied research
and the integration of laboratory science and
epidemiology with public health practice. Emphasis
is placed on determining how behavioral factors
influence the emergence or prevention of new
infections; better characterizing the health burden
of both well-established and emerging infections;
and evaluating the effectiveness and economic
benefit of strategies to prevent emerging infectious
diseases. An additional focus of Goal II is the
development and application of improved
laboratory techniques for the identification of new-
pathogens and the expanded use of molecular
epidemiology in investigating emerging diseases.
Improving rapid response capability and
contingency plans for the emergence of new strains
of known pathogens, and conducting vaccine
efficacy studies are also priorities. A final focus of
Goal II is the reestablishment of CDC extramural
programs to ensure effective partnerships with
public agencies, universities, and private industry
and to promote and support research in
surveillance, epidemiology, laboratory
investigations, and prevention of emerging
infections.
• Goal III (Prevention and Control) addresses the
dissemination of public health information and the
implementation of prevention strategies for
emerging infections. Highlighted under this goal
are plans for expanded dissemination of the CDC
publication, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
(MMWrR), as well as other important public health
information sources. Another Goal III priority is
the creation of an accessible and comprehensive
U.S. infectious disease database that increases
awareness of infectious diseases and promotes
public health action. The database wall contain
information on topics such as antimicrobial
resistance, foodbome and waterborne outbreaks,
travelers' health, antimicrobial drug availability,
and vaccine guidelines. Activities associated with
Goal III also address issues relative to the
implementation of guidelines for preventing
emerging infectious diseases and the provision of
critical prevention materials to state and local
health departments.
• Goal IV (Infrastructure) deals with issues
relating to infrastructure, particularly personnel
and physical resources. Points of emphasis include
maintaining CDC expertise in rare or unusual
infectious diseases, and establishing training
programs that emphasize the diagnosis of infectious
diseases. A public health laboratory fellowship in
infectious diseases is proposed. Also emphasized is
the need for state-of-the-art physical
resources—laboratory space, training facilities, and
equipment. Laboratory capabilities must be
maintained in a manner that optimizes flexibility
and "surge capacity," so that unanticipated public
health threats can be adequately and efficiently
addressed. Immediate priorities include improving
facilities to deal with infectious agents that require
maximum microbiologic safety precautions
(biosafety level 4 viruses). Goal IV also contains
plans for expanding facilities for maintaining
specimen banks of etiologic agents and clinical
specimens, and upgrading animal care facilities
and insectary space.
This plan reflects the commitment of CDC to meet
the challenge of important emerging public health
problems. The need to proceed rapidly is made more
urgent by a number of diseases that pose an immedi-
ate danger: methicillin-resistant Stap/iylococcus
aureus, a common cause of hospital infections, threat-
ens to develop resistance to vancomycin; penicillin re-
sistance is emerging in Streptococcus pneumoniae;
cholera is likely to be introduced into the Caribbean is-
lands from the current pandemic in the southern hemi-
sphere and the new strain, V. cholerae 0139, is
spreading throughout southern Asia; changing food in-
dustry practices and dietary choices of the American
people will bring new challenges to provide a diet safe
from pathogens such as Salmonella sp. and E. coli
0157:H7; and ongoing investigations of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome document that the geographic
distribution of this infection is much broader that the
desert Southwest. These infectious disease problems

Draft
I Table. High Priority Implementation Steps,
1994-1996
: Goal I: Surveillance
> Establish four population-based Emerging Infec-
tions Prevention and Research Centers that will
target special populations for inclusion in fo-
cused surveillance, applied research, and
epidemiology/prevention projects with initial em-
phasis on foodborne and waterborne infectious
diseases.
> Establish two physician-based Sentinel Surveil-
lance Networks to complement other surveil-
lance methods for detecting and monitoring
emerging infections such as unexplained adult
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), menin-
goencephalitis of unknown etiology, and mul-
tidrug-resistant pneumococcal disease.
> Strengthen and link four existing sites for a
global consortium of closely linked research cen-
ters to promote the detection, monitoring, and in-
vestigation of infections emerging internationally
and potentially affecting the health of Americans.
Goal II: Research
>* Reestablish a CDC extramural applied research
program that will enhance public health partner-
ships between CDC and academic centers by
providing support for emerging infectious dis-
ease research that emphasizes risk factor analy-
sis, laboratory diagnosis, and prevention
effectiveness.
Goal III: Prevention and Control
> Develop additional means to disseminate labora-
tory and public health information to inform
health professionals about the prevention and
control of emerging infections and antimicrobial
drug-resistance.
Goal IV: Infrastructure
> Reestablish a CDC program for state-of-the-art
training in diagnostic evaluation and testing for
infectious diseases to provide hospital laboratory
personnel at public health and academic medi-
cal centers with skills to support the diagnosis
and surveillance of emerging infections.
> Establish a public health laboratory fellowship in
infectious diseases, analogous to the Epidemic
Intelligence Service for training in epidemiology.
that will train medical microbiologists in CDC's
approaches to diagnosis, molecular epidemiol-
ogy, and research
emphasize the necessity of expeditiously implementing
tins plan through a balanced intramural and extramural
effort.
The goals and activities in this plan are consistent
with the goals set forth in recently proposed plans for
health care reform. Examples of issues in infectious
disease emergence that are particularly relevant to
these plans include prolonged hospitalizations caused
by hospital-acquired infections; increased morbidity
and treatment costs resulting from antimicrobial resis-
tance; and excessive burdens placed on public and
private health care delivery facilities due to commu-
nity-wide outbreaks of foodborne and waterborne
infections.
Some of the activities listed in this document are al-
ready in the planning stages and will be implemented
soon. Most will require additional funds and person-
nel. Specific details of many of the proposed activities
need further development in full cooperation with
other federal agencies, state and local health authori-
ties, academic institutions, professional societies, and
others. With this document as a guide and a first step
implementation will be based on public health needs
and resource availability This process will be ap-
proached in stages, as a longterm endeavor with sus-
tainable impact (Table).
The vision and strategy of this plan are based upon
repeated experience demonstrating that it is far less
costly, in terms of both human suffering and economics,
to anticipate and prevent infectious disease threats
than to react with expensive treatment or containment
measures to public health crises. Even with implemen-
tation of this plan there are no guarantees that a
microorganism cannot cause disaster. However, invest-
ments in surveillance, laboratory research and train-
ing, epidemiologic investigations, and integration with
prevention and control efforts will ensure that we are
better prepared to respond to emerging infectious dis-
ease threats and to lessen their impact. It is crucial
that emerging infectious disease threats be addressed
and that the basic tenets of prevention-oriented public
health policy form an integral component of our
nation's efforts to ensure health in our communities.
"Ingenuity, knowledge, and organization alter
but cannot cancel humanity's vulnerability to
invasion by parasitic forms of life. Infectious
disease which antedated the emergence of
humankind will last as long as humanity itself,
and will surely remain, as it has been hitherto.
one of the fundamental parameters and
determinants of human history."

Preface
Vaccine research and development historically has been a priority for the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). This area has
received renewed emphasis over the past year because of the resurgence of
previously declining diseases, the continued emphasis on vaccine safety, and the
focus on translating technological advances into improving the health of children
through the development of children's vaccines. Immunization experience has
shown that vaccines are critical in controlling health care costs as well as in
preventing disease and death.
On March 26, 1993,1 convened a Blue Ribbon Panel to assist us in
assessing our long-term goals for vaccine research and to recommend priorities
for the use of anticipated additional resources for FY 1993 and FY 1994. The
expert panel was asked to review key elements of the Institute's vaccine research
program and to consider priorities for short-term vaccine research, the role of
NIAID in accelerating vaccine development through the use of basic research
results, and NIAID's position in facilitating vaccine development by working with
industry and other private sector groups.
NIAID is deeply indebted to the members of the Blue Ribbon Panel and to
the staff of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, especially Dr.
John La Montagne. Their efforts are reflected in this report, which was presented
for review to the National Advisory Allergy and Infectious Diseases Council at its
June 1993 meeting. The report summarizes the discussion of the research
program by the panel and outlines a research plan for the near term.

Summary
NIAID Blue Ribbon Panel on Vaccine Research
March 26, 1993
Introduction
Support for vaccine research and development has been a major priority
for NIAID since its inception. Recent developments in immunization have
reinforced the importance of vaccines not only in disease control but also in the
control of health care costs.
Vaccines are arguably the most powerful tools ever developed for the
primary prevention of disease. The eradication of smallpox was possible because a
simple, effective, and inexpensive vaccine was available. The eradication of polio
from the Americas appears to be in view, and the possibility of global eradication of
this infection seems a realistic goal. It is important to acknowledge that in the
United States vaccines are used with two objectives in mind—to protect the
individual from disease and to control epidemic or endemic infectious disease in
the community. Vaccines provide a safe, cost-effective, and efficient way of
preventing disease, disability, and death from infectious diseases such as measles,
pertussis, diphtheria, influenza, and many others. This benefit to the community is
achieved only when effective public health programs exist.
During the last two months, the Clinton Administration has reaffirmed that
vaccines are not only essential for improving and assuring the health of the Nation's
children but that vaccines also are effective for controlling ever-rising health care
costs. As a consequence, the Administration has launched a broad-based effort to
enhance and improve immunization. This initiative includes additional support for
vaccine research.
Because it is the lead agency within the National Institutes of Health for the
support of vaccine research, NIAID sought the advice of a panel of experts on the
plans and proposals NIAID has to expand its research efforts in vaccines. NIAID—
with an integrated and comprehensive research program in infectious diseases,
immunology, vaccinology, and microbiology—is uniquely poised to expand its
vaccine research program to take advantage of growing scientific opportunities to
develop new, safe vaccines that will improve immunization coverage and prevent
diseases not currently preventable by immunization.

## p. 86 (#98) ##############################################

Charge to the Panel
NIAID's intent is to develop a long-term strategy to develop vaccines to
prevent disease in both children and adults. This panel was convened to review
the overall goals of the N1AID program for vaccine research and in particular to
focus on priorities for the use of additional resources that may be made available in
FY 1993 and 1994. The panel was asked to consider research priorities and the
plan in the context of three broad questions:
1. What are the major priorities for vaccine research for the near term?
2. How can NIA1D take maximal advantage of developments in basic
research in immunology, microbiology, and allied disciplines to
accelerate the development of vaccines?
3. How can N1A1D maximize interactions with industry and other groups
in the private sector to accelerate the development of new vaccines?
It should be added that the plan presented to the panel did not include
proposed activities supporting HIV vaccine development.
Summary of Review by the Panel
The panel reviewed the key elements of the vaccine research program at
NIAID. Extensive portfolios of investigator-initiated research projects in infectious
diseases, microbiology, and immunology are complemented by intramural
laboratories, collaborations with industry, and research groups1 that focus, at least
in part, on the study of key areas of vaccinology. In addition, NIAID supports to a
lesser extent the preclinical evaluation of vaccines in animal models and primates
and the development of reagents and reference serologic assays. Finally, the
clinical evaluation of vaccines is supplemented by the regulatory support
infrastructure NIAID developed over the past decades.
What are the major priorities for vaccine research for the near term?
In setting priorities for vaccine research, NIAID uses the technical advice of expert
groups, such as the Institute of Medicine. NIAID also seeks advice and information
from a wide variety of sources to integrate into its priority-setting process. This
information includes an assessment of the technical feasibility of a particular
vaccine, a determination of the involvement of other groups—primarily industry—
in pursuing a specific priority, and the public health importance of the problem.
NIAID also considers the emergence or reemergence of diseases, advances in
molecular biology and immunology, the Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI), and
NIAID, primarily through its Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, supports six
Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units (VTEU), one Mucosal Immunization Research
Group (MIRG), one Maternal Immunization Group (MIG), seven International
Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research (ICIDR), three Tropical Medicine Research
Centers (TMRC), five Sexually Transmitted Diseases Cooperative Research Centers
(STDCRC), and four Tropical Disease Research Units (TDRU).

the possibilities of noninfectious disease targets for vaccine research, such as
autoimmune diseases. Moreover, the potential for eradication, sustainable control
with therapeutics or other intervention strategies, and the impact of vaccine-
associated adverse events are also considered.
The panel acknowledged and recognized the relevance of these criteria and
endorsed the following specific priorities for vaccine research:
• Improvement of pertussis and measles vaccines;
• Inclusion of combination vaccine development and other goals of the
CVI;
• Development of vaccines to prevent respiratory and enteric diseases of
childhood;
• Development of vaccines to prevent sexually transmitted diseases;
• Development of new approaches for vaccine delivery, including oral
vaccines;
• Support of research to assure the safety of vaccines; and
• Development of vaccines for emerging and reemerging infectious
diseases such as malaria, dengue, and influenza.
Research plans for FY 1993 and FY 1994. The expansion of
immunization activities includes proposals for additional funding of research
activities in both FY 1993 and FY 1994. In FY 1993, additional resources for
vaccine research ($4.2 million) were proposed as part of the economic stimulus
legislation. For FY 1994, an additional $28 million is proposed in the President's
budget for vaccine research. Accordingly, a proposal was outlined to the panel for
using these additional resources.
The projects selected for FY 1993 reflect the program priorities identified
above as well as the potential for immediate implementation. The panel recognized
the importance of these criteria and endorsed these projects as significant priorities
reflecting a considerable enhancement of the vaccine program.
In contrast, the proposed plan for FY 1994 includes a variety of initiatives
that cross the developmental stream for vaccines, including specific projects on
pathogenesis, immunology, preclinical and clinical testing, field evaluation, and
infrastructure needs. As requested by the Public Health Service, this plan focuses
on three areas defined as priorities for these resources:
• Children's vaccines;
• Vaccine safety; and
• Vaccines for emerging infectious diseases.
Discussion of the FY 1994 proposal revealed that these initiatives are
intended to enhance the existing program by expanding scientific advances or
87


## p. 88 (#100) #############################################

programmatic opportunities. However, the plan does not, in isolation, describe
the only priorities for the NIAID research program. For example, two areas of
research—the pursuit of group antigens that might stimulate a protective response
and the investigation of liposomes/ISCOMS as delivery vehicles—were recognized
as scientifically important areas and already are receiving significant support from
the Institute. The panel readily endorsed the Institute's proposal for FY 1994.
How can NIAID take maximum advantage of developments in basic
research in immunology, microbiology, and allied disciplines to accelerate
the development of vaccines? This question was the source of considerable
discussion during presentation of the plan. Nine issues emerged that the panel
recommended be addressed. These are listed below, although not necessarily in
priority order. All but the first and seventh were specifically identified in the FY
1993-1994 plan.
1. The need to organize and convene workshops on areas of vaccine research
identified in the plan. Progress in vaccine development, as in any
endeavor in science, requires exchange of information and
communication between interested scientists. The panel stressed
the importance of this process and recommended that additional
workshops be considered as a way of enhancing communication
among all scientists interested in vaccine research. There is an urgent
need for multidisciplinary study groups to identify basic principles of
artificial immunization as specified in topics 2,3, and 4 below. In
addition, NIAID indicated that it was proceeding with more detailed
research plans for the development of more than 20 specific vaccines.
The appropriate evolution of these plans may require that NIAID
convene a series of workshops to discuss them. The panel endorsed
this approach as generally useful but cautioned that the plans must be
flexible so that the scientific community can take maximum advantage
of relevant scientific developments as they occur.
2. The need for basic research in immunology as it relates to vaccine research.
Research initiatives in neonatal immunology are especially relevant to
the CVI goal of immunizing infants as early in life as possible. There
is a need for enhanced understanding of microbial-induced
immunosuppression and interference by maternal antibody. The
Institute funds a limited number of grants in neonatal immunology,
and the panel suggested that additional resources would be valuable
in this area. Also, research on the immunogenetics of vaccine
responsiveness and nonresponsiveness will be difficult, especially in
reference to duration of the immune response. Significant work has
been done in animal models but has yet to be extended to humans.
88


## p. 89 (#101) #############################################

The panel expressed specific interest in research on immunogenetics,
immunologic memory, priming, the role of cell-mediated immunity,
immune correlates of protection, antigenic competition, and the
cytolytic response in vaccine efficacy.
3. The needfor a better understanding of antigen presentation, adjuvant effects,
and immunopotentiation. The distinction of adjuvants and
immunopotentiation from presentation systems as separate entities was
emphasized by the panel. Additional work on novel antigen
presentation systems is needed. Vaccine vectors offer the potential for
delivery of multiple antigens and thus are being explored for both
veterinary as well as human vaccines. The 1993 annual for dan Report
describes recent progress in this field. The panel suggested that recent
advances in the development of vectored vaccines for veterinary use,
such as rinderpest, must be considered in the further development of
experimental vaccines using vectors, based on BCG or Salmonella typhi
or canarypox, for use in humans.
4. The need for the development and support of animal models for target
diseases, both for investigation of pathogenesis and evaluation of vaccine and
therapeutic candidates. New opportunities, such as transgenic animals
as models for the human immune system, highlight the importance of
facilities for both small animals and primates. The need to support
research on appropriate animal model systems was recognized and
discussed at length by the panel. Research for some diseases, such as
multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis, requires high containment animal
facilities. Other groups have suggested that regional centers might be
the best solution to this problem. The panel considered regional
centers to be the least favorable option because the specific needs of
investigators could not be dealt with on a regional basis. They favored
the systematic strengthening of animal research resources at the local
level. The panel suggested, for example, that expanding the capability
to study primate model systems be considered and encouraged the
Institute to give that proposal high priority. The panel also recognized
that many of the model systems being used, such as transgenic mice
that carry the poliovirus receptor for the study of neurovirulence, are
costly. Changes in the national standards for animal care also are
increasing costs, but the panel strongly endorsed proposals for using
animal model systems in support of the vaccine research agenda
outlined in the plan.
89


## p. 90 (#102) #############################################

5. The need for basic research on specific targets that pose safety concerns for
both existing vaccines and candidate vaccines. The need for additional
basic research was discussed. The Institute of Medicine study on the
Adverse Effects of Pertussis and Rubella Vaccines substantiated a causal
association between rubella vaccination in adult women and acute
arthritis and potentially chronic arthritis. Similarly, recent studies have
pointed to the potential for long-term adverse events associated with a
candidate measles vaccine that could be used in infants. Although
good vaccines exist for both diseases, a better understanding of the
adverse events, the possible development of an improved vaccine, and
the systematic evaluation of alternative approaches to immunization are
important to support the national and global immunization programs
to prevent congenital rubella syndrome and whooping cough. RSV
vaccine research has been substantially hampered by safety concerns
resulting from immunopotentiation produced by vaccine candidates 30
years ago. Research must focus on these issues to develop vaccines for
this important pathogen in children. Finally, there is a need to expand
support for basic research on potential neurologic complications of
vaccines.
6. Emerging infections. The potential of developing vaccines for emerging
and reemerging diseases was discussed in the context of three specific
problems—influenza, tropical or parasitic infections, and Lyme
borreliosis. The panel acknowledged the difficulties inherent in
working on these problems. Despite technical problems, emerging
infections compel action. A more detailed plan has been developed for
Lyme disease vaccines. The proposed research initiative includes basic
research on pathogenesis, especially important in a relatively new
disease, with research on in vitro correlates of immunity and
development of field sites for evaluating candidate vaccines. Recent
advances in Lyme disease vaccine development predicate the need for
planning and developing such sites in the near future. Influenza
infections are constantly emerging. The expectation is that in time a
new pandemic shift will occur, and in many ways we are not any better
prepared for that event now than we were 30 years ago. The panel
recommended that influenza vaccines receive additional emphasis.
Finally, the impact of parasitic infections such as malaria and
schistosomiasis is truly vast. NIAID, in collaboration with U.S. Agency
for International Development, has expanded its efforts in malaria
vaccine development. These efforts must be enhanced and expanded
to take advantage of the exciting developments in parasitic
immunology and pathogenesis. The panel strongly endorsed NIAID
proposals in this area as timely and appropriate.
90


## p. 91 (#103) #############################################

7. The need to emphasize training in vaccine research and to improve peer
review. The panel noted that research training was not specifically
addressed in the NIAID plan. The panel considered this to be an
essential component of any successful research plan and urged in
the strongest possible terms that training be specifically identified as
an initiative under the plan. The effective development of vaccines
requires skills and expertise usually not available in traditional training
situations. The feasibility of expanding the training portfolio to
incorporate training in vaccinology will be a challenge because the
total number of trainee slots (FTTPs) at the pre- and postdoctoral levels
is restricted. Despite this obstacle, the panel strongly believes that
training opportunities in vaccinology should be expanded and urged
NIAID to explore all options for such an expansion. Concern also
was expressed about issues related to the peer review of applications
because in many established study sections vaccine research is not
considered to be within the purview of the review groups or not
"cutting-edge" science. The panel urged NIAID to take appropriate
steps to reduce the impact of this bias toward the vaccine research
efforts outlined in the plan.
8. The need for the Institute to foster interactions with biotechnology firms and
the vaccine industry. NIAID has a long history of productive and useful
interactions with industry on vaccine development. These interactions
will expand in the future as discoveries in basic science are applied
more aggressively to vaccine problems. NIAID proposes to enhance
and facilitate this process by expanding its ability to move basic
research findings into clinical investigation. This will require
significant expansion of the capacity of NIAID to produce experimental
lots of candidate vaccines for Phase I or II clinical trials. The proposed
expansion of this effort is an integral element of the plan. The panel
agreed that this was a need and strongly endorsed the Institute's
proposal to expand its capability in this area. In commenting that
additional efforts should be undertaken to inform interested parties
about vaccine research developments, the panel identified the
Institute's fordan Report as an effective vehicle for such communication.
9. Multidisciplinary Vaccine Research Centers. The feasibility of developing
or strengthening multidisciplinary centers for vaccine evaluation in
endemic areas was discussed at length. Concerns included the
historical problems of sites supported by the Tropical Disease Research
(TDR) program of the World Health Organization. It was noted,
however, that the efforts of the TDR have not received the support
necessary to ensure long-term success. The panel was cautioned not
to use this experience as the only frame of reference. Other efforts,
91


## p. 92 (#104) #############################################

including the NIAID-supported International Collaborations in
Infectious Disease Research (ICIDR) program, have been more
successful in establishing effective research groups overseas. The
ICIDR program incorporated domestic U.S. research groups directly in
support of overseas centers. This is considered a major reason for the
success of the ICIDR program. Furthermore, a number of American
universities have established stable academic interactions with centers
outside of the United States. The value of developing consolidated
international ventures at selected sites was recognized and strongly
endorsed by the panel. The panel also recommended that centers
currently supported by NIAID be expanded where possible and that
collaborations between components of NIAID be encouraged where
such arrangements are congruent. For example, sexually transmitted
disease vaccine research efforts are compatible with HIV vaccine
research activities.
How can we maximize interactions with industry and other groups in
the private sector to accelerate the development of new vaccines? NIAID uses
a variety of approaches to stimulate and support Institute-industry collaborations.
These include the following:
• Use of negotiated Cooperative Research and Development Agreements
(CRADAs);
• Provision of direct support to projects via grants or contracts;
• Provision of access to Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units
(VTEUs) and other testing facilities;
• Support of clinical trials of vaccines; and
• Provision of regulatory support (particularly important for smaller
firms).
All of these approaches are currently being used successfully. For example,
CRADAs have already been established for the development of influenza and
pertussis vaccines. The VTEUs have a long and distinguished history of clinically
evaluating candidate vaccines. They are uniquely suited and positioned to conduct
comparative trials as was done with the acellular pertussis vaccine candidates.
The panel endorsed and encouraged NIAID to strengthen further these
interactions. The panel suggested additional activities, such as brokering relations
between companies and exploring collaborations in such areas as joint
government-industry support of a vaccine production facility. The success of the
Children's Vaccine Initiative will depend in great measure on the ability to work
effectively with colleagues in industry.

THE CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION INITIATIVE:
PURPOSE AND TARGETS
The Public Health Service (PHS) has established the purpose of the Childhood Immunization Initiative
(CII) as being the elimination of childhood cases of six vaccine-preventable diseases -- diphtheria, Haemophilus
influenzae type b, measles, poliomyelitis, rubella (German measles), and tetanus ~ in the United States by 1996.
Recent trends in the incidence of these diseases, as well as of three others -- hepatitis B, mumps, and pertussis
(whooping cough) -- are shown in table 6, together with the CII targets for 1996.

To achieve the disease elimination targets shown in table 6, the PHS aims to raise vaccination coverage of
2-year-old children with each major routinely recommended vaccine to 90 percent by 1996. Estimated coverage
for 1992 and target coverage for 1994 to 1996 are shown in table 7.

vaccines. To that end, the CII bears most directly on two of the four goals of the plan (namely, goals 3, and 4)
and on nine of its objectives (namely, objectives 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, and 4.6).

CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION INITIATIVE:
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION
ACTION PLAN
4/19/94
INTRODUCTION
In the United States immunization levels for children entering
kindergarten are high. However, immunization levels for 2-year-
olds are poor. Approximately 15 to 3 0 percent of 2-year-old
children have not been adequately vaccinated against individual
diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio, diphtheria,
tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough). In addition, about 35
percent of such children have not been fully immunized against
all 7 of these diseases. Coverage is lower for more recently
introduced vaccines; approximately 50 percent of 2 year old
children have not received the recommended doses of Haemophilus
influenzae type b vaccine and 90 percent are inadequately
vaccinated against hepatitis B. As a result, millions of
American children are not adequately protected against illness
and possible death despite the availability of vaccines to
prevent these diseases.
With increasing numbers of American children more readily exposed
to infectious disease in day-care settings, complete immunization
of children by age 2 becomes critical. An effective system is
needed to assure that children receive 11-15 doses of recommended
vaccines by their second birthday in about 5 visits to a health
care provider. In response to this need, President Clinton
launched the Childhood Immunization Initiative (CII) -- a
national comprehensive approach to increase vaccination levels
for children under the age of two years.
Critical goals have been set (See Attachment, p. 15):
By 1996 - reduce most diseases preventable by childhood
vaccination to zero;
- increase vaccination levels for 2-year-old
children to at least 90 percent for the initial
and most critical doses in the vaccine series, and
70 percent for more recently introduced vaccines;
and
- begin building a vaccine delivery system to
maintain these achievements in the United States
within a reformed health care system.
By 2000 - maintain zero levels of disease preventable by
childhood vaccination;
- further increase immunity by increasing
110


## p. 111 (#123) ############################################

vaccination levels for 2-year-olds to 90 percent
for the complete series of recommended vaccine
doses against all nine diseases; and
- finish building a comprehensive vaccine delivery-
system that reliably guarantees protection to all
children.
The following is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
(CDC) plan for achieving the CII goals for 1996 and beyond,
including major objectives, action steps, and milestones to
measure progress. The attached timetable further specifies the
approach to accomplishing the 1996 goals. The assistance of key
partners is essential to accomplishing these 1996 goals. Such
partners include community groups, private health care providers,
public health departments, schools, religious institutions,
parents, federal agencies, and others.
Ill


## p. 112 (#124) ############################################

APPROACH
Achieving these goals requires federal agencies, community
groups, private health care providers, public health departments,
schools, religious institutions, parents, and others all working
together. As vaccines are delivered locally through both public
and private sector providers, efforts must focus on providing
communities with the resources, skills, and support needed to
reach parents and children.
Key activities in this plan will strengthen the vaccine delivery
infrastructure in all 50 states to meet the immediate needs for
reaching the 1996 and later goals. As health reform is
implemented, it is anticipated that vaccinations will be
increasingly provided to children by the private sector. Public
health agencies will need to ensure that children in their
jurisdictions are appropriately vaccinated by providing support
for private sector vaccination delivery. Therefore, the plan
includes new activities designed to improve public-and private-
sector collaboration and private-sector capacity to administer
vaccines more effectively in the health care system of the
future.
National activities will include financial and technical
assistance to states, communities, as well as mass media
promotion, development of information systems, surveillance, and
applied research to improve vaccines. Local efforts will use
Immunization Action Plans (IAP) -- road maps developed by states
and major urban areas -- to improve immunization levels. In
addition, the Vaccines for Children program will provide vaccines
free of charge to more than 60 percent of children, thus reducing
cost as a barrier to vaccination.
This plan includes 2 segments: first, the key objectives and
action steps, and, second, milestones and timelines for these
action steps.
Efforts will be focused in five broad areas directed toward
achieving the 1996 CII goals:
I. Improve infrastructure for providing vaccines
II. Increase community participation and parent/provider
education
III. Reduce vaccine cost for parents
IV. Improve monitoring of vaccination, coverage and
disease
V. Improve vaccines and vaccination schedules
112


## p. 113 (#125) ############################################

I. IMPROVE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR PROVIDING VACCINES
Federal grants to state and local programs will be increased.
This will permit hiring more nurses, opening more clinics at more
convenient times, making the delivery of services more "user-
friendly", developing information systems, and providing
incentive funding. CDC will offer financial and technical
assistance to public health agencies that will work with private
providers to ensure children served by these providers are
adequately immunized on time. The plan involves grant awards to
87 state and local government health departments with most funds
distributed based on state and local program needs. To provide
incentives to stimulate performance, the remaining funds will be
awarded to health departments based on their progress toward
reaching immunization coverage goals. For fiscal year 1994, new
CII activities will amount to a total of about $90 million.
Technical assistance will take a variety of forms, including
conferences, phone consultation, publications, and on-site
collaboration, training, and sharing of information between CDC
and state and local health departments. The primary purpose is
to share successful methods and technologies that are developed
by one community quickly and effectively with other communities.
The practices and policies of health care providers will be
improved to reduce the number of missed opportunities for
immunization.
Federal assistance to develop state-based immunization
information systems will strengthen immediately the capacity of
providers at all levels to manage the information they need to
raise and sustain high immunization levels. More specifically,
these systems will help: 1) parents to know when immunizations
are due, 2) providers to assess the immunization needs of their
patients, old and new, at each office visit, and 3) providers to
monitor the immunization coverage of their patient population as
a whole. For fiscal year 1994 these grants will amount to $8
million.
Objective 1; Assist states and communities in meeting coverage
goals by developing a comprehensive immunization
infrastructure
Action Steps:
a. Provide financial and direct assistance to state and
local health departments to implement their approaches
b. Provide ongoing technical support to states and local
health departments
113


## p. 114 (#126) ############################################

b. Design and implement the electronic network for state-
based systems
c. Develop a prototype immunization information system
software application
d. Provide grant funding and technical assistance to help
create, implement, evaluate, and maintain statewide
immunization information systems
e. Maintain the implemented immunization information
systems
f. Obtain public/private sector participation in the State
Immunization Information Systems
Objective 3; Strengthen immunization delivery in the private
sector
Action Steps:
a. Coordinate and communicate with private
provider associations
b. Promote the Standards for Pediatric Immunization
Practices (SPIP)
c. Develop, test, and promote an easy-to-use provider
self-assessment tool
d. Conduct surveys to assess immunization knowledge,
attitudes, and practices
e. Work with the managed care industry to set immunization
coverage targets in their populations and monitor
progress
114


## p. 115 (#127) ############################################

II. INCREASE COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND
PARENT/PROVIDER EDUCATION
Public understanding about the importance of immunizations is
critical if parents are to fulfill their responsibilities to take
children to their health care provider five times for routine
vaccinations. In April 1994, a long-term, national outreach
campaign will be initiated to improve parent awareness and to
prompt health care providers to use all health care contacts to
administer needed vaccines to children.
At the national level, elements of this campaign will include
widespread distribution of radio, television, and printed public
service announcements; dissemination of a national theme and
call-to-action; and other activities designed to unify efforts
throughout the country. These activities will be accomplished in
collaboration with many voluntary, professional, and private
organizations. Through these national partners and their state
and local affiliates, coordinated efforts will convey messages
throughout communities.
State health departments will play an essential role in this
effort. As key partners, these health departments have unique
insight and ability to address community participation and
education issues. At the state and community levels, the
campaign will include a grassroots effort to unite all sectors of
the community (e.g. public and private health care providers,
business groups, community leaders, schools, racial and ethnic
minority groups, voluntary and service organizations, religious
institutions, and media affiliates.)
To effectively implement all CII activities, partnership building
among public and private providers, community organizations, and
public health agencies is essential. Many Federal agencies in
addition to CDC support immunization activities, provide
vaccinations to children, or reimburse for vaccination services.
Also, many agencies have access through education, food, housing,
or other assistance programs to populations at high risk for
undervaccination. Similarly, many private providers and
organizations vaccinate children or otherwise serve or advocate
for children. Coordination of these efforts will be strengthened
and partnerships with new providers will be formed to improve the
vaccination of children. For fiscal year 1994, new CII
activities will amount to a total of about $21 million ($20
million for the campaign and grassroots community organizing
activities, and $1 million for partnership-building activities).
Objective 1; Motivate the general public and high-risk
populations to seek and obtain immunizations for
children

III. REDUCE VACCINE COST FOR PARENTS
To reduce vaccine cost as a barrier to vaccination, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services will initiate the
Vaccines for Children program on October 1, 1994. This program,
which is incorporated under section 192 8 of the Social Security
Act, requires the Federal government to purchase vaccines from
manufacturers and provide them at no cost to participating public
and private health care providers. In fiscal year 1995, these
activities will amount to a total of over $400 million.
The vaccines may be used for children aged 0-18 years who are
eligible for Medicaid, are without health insurance, or are
American Indian. Children with health insurance who are served
by federally qualified health centers also will be able to
receive free vaccines if their insurance does not cover
vaccination. States will be permitted to purchase additional
vaccines at reduced Federal contract prices for distribution to
all providers. Efforts at the national, state, and local levels
will be initiated to include immunization benefits in all types
of health insurance policies. The action steps reflect the
advice of a wide range of public health groups, such as other
Federal agencies, private health care providers, state and local
health departments, and others.
Currently, twelve states have universal vaccine distribution
systems. These systems provide free vaccines to all public and
private providers in the state. Because of the extensive,
additional vaccine resources provided to states by the Vaccines
for Children Program, twelve additional states have indicated
their interest to develop such universal distribution systems.
Objective 1: Implement the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program
Action Steps:
a. Develop, implement, and maintain an automated system to
purchase and distribute vaccines to approved providers
b. Develop, implement, and maintain a vaccine reporting
and accountability system
c. Provide ongoing guidance to state and other agencies
which will help operate the program
d. Work with the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices to develop schedules and dosages, and
describe vaccine contraindications as mandated by the
Vaccines for Children legislation

e. Work with the Health Care Financing
Administration to accomplish necessary
Medicaid and financial requirements
Objective 2: Improve insurance coverage for immunizations
Action Steps:
a. Develop model state legislation requiring insurance
policies to cover immunization and encourage states to
adopt it (National Vaccine Program Office (NVPO))
b. Work with others in the public and private sectors
(e.g., HCFA, states, unions, major employers, and trade
associations) to include immunization as a covered
benefit in insurance policies

IV. IMPROVE MONITORING OF VACCINATION COVERAGE AND
DISEASE
Improvements over the current system are being established to
measure vaccination coverage among infants and young children at
the national, state, and local levels to identify undervaccinated
populations and to monitor progress in achieving coverage goals.
Also, clinic or office-based assessments are being promoted to
help health care providers increase coverage among the
populations they serve. Furthermore, surveillance for vaccine-
preventable diseases will be intensified and each case of disease
targeted for elimination will be investigated. Additional
surveillance improvements include enhancing capacity at state and
local levels, refining reporting forms and electronic systems,
and updating case investigation and reporting forms. For fiscal
year 1994, new CII activities will amount to a total of about $39
million.
Objective 1; Conduct vaccination coverage surveys of the total
U.S. population, of state populations, and of
selected city and county populations
Action Steps:
a. Maintain participation in the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS) to monitor nationwide vaccination
coverage levels
b. Verify NHIS parental responses with provider records to
adjust vaccination coverage estimates
c. Obtain immunization coverage data for each state and
IAP area (Random Digit Dialing Survey)
Objective 2; Promote the routine evaluation of coverage in the
client populations served by public clinics and
private providers
Action Steps:
a. Promote the use of immunization record assessment
survey methodology and software
b. Encourage the use of immunization record assessment as
a management tool for improving immunization services
at the clinic level
Objective 3: Improve reporting, analysis, and dissemination of
disease surveillance data and enhance epidemic
response capacity

V. IMPROVE VACCINES AND VACCINATION SCHEDULES
Tools for controlling vaccine preventable diseases are available
now, but can be improved. The National Institutes of Health and
the Food and Drug Administration have lead responsibilities to
develop and license new, safer, and more effective vaccines. In
addition to assisting in developing new and improved vaccines,
CDC will implement the CII and focus on improving the use of
existing vaccines, including monitoring their safety and
optimizing vaccination schedules. For fiscal year 1994, new CII
activities will amount to a total of about $12 million.
Objective 1: Optimize the existing childhood immunization
schedule
Action Step;
a. Simplify the current vaccine schedule and develop a
single preferred schedule endorsed by both Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices, the American
Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of
Family Phys i c i ans.
Objective 2: Improve the safety of existing vaccines
Action Steps:
a. Evaluate the safety of currently licensed vaccines
through the CDC-FDA Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting
System (VAERS)
b. Evaluate hypotheses about the causes of adverse events
c. Evaluate efficacy of currently used vaccines
d. Determine the safety of currently licensed vaccines
Objective 3; Promote development of vaccines
Action Steps:
a. Work with the NVP to provide guidance to vaccine
manufacturers (NVP Lead)
b. Conduct post-licensure studies of vaccines
c. Promote operational research to simplify the
immunization schedule by improved use of
simultaneous or combined administration of
antigens.

Appendix 11
SUMMARY EXCERPTS FROM BENEFIT/COST
STUDIES OF IMMUNIZATION
Following are excerpts from eight benefit/cost studies of the efficacy of childhood immunization programs
using the major routinely recommended vaccines as reported in the scientific literature.
* * *
PERTUSSIS
"...A pertussis vaccination program reaching 90% of children would reduce pertussis incidence and disease-
related costs by 90%, with an overall benefit/cost ratio of 11.1:1. This represents a conservative estimate, since
indirect costs were not included." (Hinman, A. R., and J. P. Koplan. 1984. Pertussis and pertussis vaccine:
Reanalysis of benefits, risks, costs. JAMA 251:3109-3113.)
DIPHTHERIA
"...Before routine immunization started, more than 1 in 20 inhabitants of the temperate zone suffered from
diphtheria and more than 1 in 20 of the infected subjects died from the disease. After the introduction of a
comprehensive immunization campaign in the U.K. in 1942 covering all diphtheria-susceptible persons below 15
years of age, a 10-fold reduction in diphtheria incidence was obtained within 5 years and a 100-fold reduction
within 10 years. Similar results were noted in other countries. These immunization programs have ensured that
diphtheria has not been a public health problem for more than a generation...." (Hennessen, and A. H. Griffith,
1978. The role of immunization in the control of diphtheria. International Symposium on Immunization:
Benefit versus risk factors. Develop Biol Standard 43:3-13.)
MEASLES
"...Medical and other cost savings from federally sponsored programs prove to be considerable ~ over $1 billion
during an eight-year period. Even discounting real savings from pain and suffering associated with death and
retardation, direct economic benefits in productivity and medical care resources are approximately $10.34 per
$1.00 of program costs.... Substantial resources have been released for other purposes by a national commitment
to eradicate measles as a communicable disease." (Albritton, R. B. 1978. Cost-benefits of measles eradication:
Effects of a Federal intervention. Policy Analysis 4:1-22.)
"...In addition to the cases averted and lives saved, an estimated 7,900 cases of mental retardation were obviated,
709,000 years of normal and productive life preserved by preventing deaths from measles and the mental
retardation following measles encephalitis.... The value of the net benefits achieved through immunization is $1.3
billion saved for the 10-year period." (Witte, J. J., and N. W. Axnick. 1975. The benefits from 10 years of
measles immunization in the United States. Pub Health Rep 90:205-207.)
125


## p. 126 (#138) ############################################

MEASLES, MUMPS, AND RUBELLA
"...Without an immunization program, an estimated 3,325,000 cases of measles would occur as compared to
2,872 actual cases in 1983 with a program. Instead of an expected 1.5 million rubella cases annually, there were
only 3,816 actual cases. Mumps cases were lowered from an expected 2.1 million to 32,850 actual cases.
Comparable reductions in disease-associated complications, sequelae, and deaths are gained with an
immunization program. Without a vaccination program, disease costs would have been almost $1.4 billion."
(White, C. C, J. P. Koplan, and W. A. Orenstein. 1985. Benefits, risks, and costs of immunization for measles,
mumps, and rubella. Am J Pub Health 75:739-744.)
"...The health and resource benefits due to vaccination against measles during the first 20 years of vaccine
licensure were estimated. Vaccination against measles prevented 52 million cases, 5,200 deaths, and 17,400
cases of mental retardation, achieving a net savings of $5.1 billion." (Bloch, A. B., W. A. Orenstein, H. C.
Stetler et al. 1985. Health impact of measles vaccination in the United States. Pediatrics. 76:525-532.)
BENEFIT/COST ANALYSIS OF RUBELLA VACCINATION POLICY
"...To analyze rubella vaccination strategies benefits and costs were calculated for the prevention of rubella.
With no vaccination, lifetime expenditures for congenital rubella syndrome in offspring of females are greater
than $35 per female. Expenditures for acute rubella are less than $2.70 per person. Cost, when monovalent
vaccine is used, is $3.00 per person." (Schoenbaum, S. C, et al. 1976. Benefit-cost analysis of rubella
vaccination policy. New Engl J Med. 294:306-310.)
A BENEFIT/COST ANALYSIS OF MUMPS VACCINE
"...A mumps vaccination program, in which mumps vaccine was given as part of a measles-mumps-rubella
combination, would reduce costs associated with mumps by more than 86%, with a benefit-cost ratio of 7.4:1,
using reported incidence rates. The program has a benefit/cost ratio of 39:1 when approximations of actual
mumps incidence are used in the analysis. Mumps vaccination is highly cost-beneficial." (Koplan, J. P., and
S. R. Preblud. 1982. A benefit-cost analysis of mumps vaccine. Amer J Dis Child. 136:362-364.)
