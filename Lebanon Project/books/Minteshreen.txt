Minteshreen for a Secular State
Transitioning to a Secular State
To begin the process of abolishing political sectarianism, efforts must be carried out according to a specific plan that is to be implemented within a specified transitional period. The aim of such a plan is to establish and strengthen the various components of the civil state, which protects the rights of all segments of the Lebanese population and its various components without discrimination or preference, as a starting point in the process of establishing secularism within the state.
The first step is to approve an optional civil personal status law that enables the introduction of civil courts as an option in settling disputes, instead of restricting citizens to spiritual and denominational courts. It also requires the amendment of Article 95 of the Constitution, and implementing what that entails in terms of reshaping the mechanisms of appointment of first category administrative positions, in accordance with the principles of competence and experience, and away from all forms of position allocation according to the sectarian quota system currently adopted. In addition to the above, it is necessary to hold parliamentary elections on the basis of an electoral law that adopts the proportional system, excludes the sectarian restrictions and adopts the governorate as an electoral district, provided that these elections coincide with the establishment of the Senate as stipulated in the Taif agreement, and granting it limited powers within a specified transitional period.

 Defense Strategy
The weakness and absence of the state and its inability to protect Lebanese citizens, especially in the aftermath of the civil war, has led to the emergence of many armed groups that took upon themselves the tasks of deterring external aggressions and resisting occupying forces. This resulted in replacing the concept of national defense, which the state monopolizes with its armed forces, with the concept of popular resistance, which is based on ideological criteria (left, right) and/or sectarian ones (Christian resistance, Islamic resistance). This means that Lebanon's defense ability is intrinsically linked to a specific sect or political group, which renders the country vulnerable to targeting in the wake of any political clash between sects, parties, or their regional and international sponsors.
Faced with this reality, which we are currently experiencing with regard to Himperative to adopt a comprehensive defense strategy, not only military, but also economic, social and diplomatic. It is also important that this defense strategy has the support of the widest segment of the Lebanese people, and returns the task of defending Lebanon to the military and security institutions, noting the following:
Limiting the decision of war and peace to the political authority represented by the Lebanese government, and assigning it to define the rules of engagement that the armed forces must abide by
Ensuring the transfer of the necessary human and material resources from fighters, weapons and equipment to the Lebanese military and security institutions, in a manner that does not expose these resources to any danger, and guarantees the independence of the military and security institutions, as well as the continuity of their subordination to political authority
Securing a defense budget and a diplomatic umbrella to allow the Lebanese army to supply qualitative weapons, especially advanced air defense systems capable of protecting the Lebanese airspace
Ensuring the right of the Lebanese state to deter any external aggression, especially the attacks of the Israeli enemy on land, in the sea, in the air, and against all of Lebanon's interests at home and abroad
Fully demarcating the land and sea borders with Syria in the east and north - including the Shebaa Farms and Kfarshouba hills - and with the concerned authorities at the borders with occupied Palestine, in a manner that fully guarantees geographical, historical and economic rights
 
Hostility with the Israeli entity
Israel is an entity that was established on the land of the occupied state of Palestine, and that has followed an expansionist military strategy, occupying Lebanese lands, committing brutal massacres against Lebanese men and women, and pursuing a policy based on the permanent and continuous encroachment on Lebanon's sovereignty by land, sea and air. We at Minteshreen consider that the hostility with Israel is not only circumstantial; that is, it s not only related to the history and current state of the conflict, but also based on our principles, coming from a humanitarian perspective. In our view, the Israeli entity is a racist and sectarian entity based
on extremist and exclusionary ideas, that does not recognize the right of return of Palestinians in Lebanon and the diaspora to their lands, and adopts the policy of apartheid between Arabs and Jews to secure its durability, which makes it fundamentally inconsistent with the concept of a just civil state such as the one we seek to build. In view of the above, we consider that any solution to the conflict with the Israeli entity can only be based on the Arab peace initiative launched from Beirut, which is based on the right of the Palestinians to an independent state that secures their basic rights and preserves the right of return, and stipulates that Israel withdraw from all occupied Arab lands that were occupied after the Naksa. This includes the Shebaa Farms, the Kfarshouba hills, and the Ghajar village, in accordance with the international resolutions issued by the United Nations.
Lebanese Syrian Relations
Politically, the relationship between Syria and Lebanon has never been a relationship of mutual respect between two independent states, despite their strong historical ties and their economic, social and familial relations that transcend the boundaries of geography and politics. Therefore, we consider that the beginning of any healthy relationship with Syria must be based on respect for mutual sovereignty. Progress begins with the abolition of the Syrian-Lebanese Supreme Council, the control of common borders, the closure of all illegal crossings, and the disclosure of the fate of the missing Lebanese in Syrian prisons. Economically, and in view of the civil war that
ravaged Syria, as well as the economic and political crisis that Lebanon is going through currently, it is imperative to establish advanced economic relations that pave the way for the reconstruction of Syria and Lebanon's economies, within the framework of an integrative methodology based on common interests and respect for mutual sovereignty between the two countries.
International Relations
27
    The state of fragmentation and division that has always dominated the political powers in Lebanon has turned them and their parties into mere tools in the game of nations. Lebanon became hostage of regional and international conflicts, which lead to its stability being closely linked to geopolitical fluctuations and conflicts of axes. And thus, the country became trapped in an eternal cycle of imported conflicts and circumstantial settlements between parties, all
of whom are pawned to foreign powers, all of whom have destroyed, killed and accumulated wealth in war and peace
at the expense of the Lebanese people. We at Minteshreen consider that the only gateway to Lebanon's political and security stability is, firstly, the establishment of an actual civil state that abolishes the agency of sects over citizens and ends their hegemony on people, along with putting an end to the foreign domination of Lebanese political life. Secondly, we must adopt the principle of neutrality and non-alignment with any state, party, or axis within the regional and international conflicts, while preserving the right to confront any external aggression within a defense strategy. As for economic and cultural progress, the Lebanese foreign policy must harness all its energies to exploit Lebanon's strategic position, to open up to the west and east, and to establish a new position for it on the international arena as a center of convergence, not conflicts.
        
  Minteshreen to Solve the Refugee Crisis
The issue of asylum is a humanitarian issue. A refugee is a person who forcibly left their country and cannot return to it
for fear of persecution because of religion, nationality, or political opinion or affiliation, and therefore, a refugee is a victim. We at Minteshreen, from a humanitarian standpoint,
can only stand by the victims of wars and conflicts, within the economic capabilities of our country, and in a manner that takes into account the concerns of the Lebanese society about any demographic changes that may occur in the country's population, especially after the number of Syrian refugees increased dramatically after the outbreak of the Syrian war.
Any solution to the refugee issue in Lebanon can only be achieved through a national plan, with the participation of the public sector in organization and implementation, as well as that of civil society organizations in Lebanon and international organizations, noting the following:
Building the plan on the principle of the right of return for Palestinian refugees and the right to the safe and voluntary return of Syrian refugees, and considering these rights as an inevitable and final goal of the plan
Granting refugees their social and economic rights, and safeguarding their right to a decent life until their return to their country
Preventing and criminalizing racist measures taken by local administrations, including municipalities and others, against refugees, such as measures to prevent movement and limit freedoms
28
 Benefiting from foreign workers in an integrated manner with the Lebanese workforce, and identifying the local economic sectors that deserve protection
Developing a plan with a specific timetable to secure the safe and voluntary return of the largest number of displaced Syrians and refugees to safe areas in Syria
Harnessing all of Lebanon's energies and diplomatic relations to enshrine the right of return of Palestinian refugees to their occupied lands

  Minteshreen for the Lebanese Diaspora
Expatriates have played a key role in securing the continuity
of the Lebanese entity since its inception, despite many
antagonisms such as their exclusion from political, economic
and social decisions, depriving them of their deposits and stealing their life s work after the economic collapse in the year 2019. On October 17, expatriates were in the forefront of the protest movements abroad, and provided support for reformist groups on the ground in Lebanon. They have always considered that their alienation and displacement was a result of the economic, political and security reality that the country experienced, due to the composition of its sectarian system and the choices of the corrupt political class. Lebanon ، s relationship with its expatriates must change through a systematic plan that includes the following:
The right to effectively represent expatriates in Lebanese political life
Facilitating and mechanizing the expatriate voting process in a way that guarantees their right to vote and the integrity of the elections
Ensuring the independence of embassies and consulates and that they are not aligned or affiliated with any political party
29
  ،
.
Encouraging expatriates to support the interests of Lebanon by establishing a public affairs committee in each of the countries with a significant Lebanese diaspora, to serve as pressure groups whose tasks are to support policies that are beneficial to Lebanon
Stimulating and protecting expatriate investments in productive projects across various sectors, with the aim of ensuring their participation in developing the structure of the Lebanese economy
Creating an electronic directory to facilitate communication between Lebanese merchants, industrialists and farmers with expatriates working in similar sectors abroad
Establishing educational exchange programs in secondary and higher education institutions between resident students and expatriate students, with the aim of strengthening the Lebanese identity and developing students' experiences
